===== 2025 Q4  (2025-05-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Microchip's Q4 and FY '25 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Steve Sanghi, the Executive Chair, CEO and President. Thank you, and you may proceed sir.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Rich Simoncic, Microchip's COO; Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's CFO; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will provide an update on our restructuring, Eric will go over fourth quarter fiscal year 2025 financial performance, and Rich will then review some product line updates. I will then provide an overview of the current business environment and our first quarter fiscal year 2026 guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Since I returned as Microchip's CEO on November 18, 2024, I have spent a significant amount of time evaluating key aspects of Microchip's business. On March 3, 2025, I provided an update on our nine-point recovery plan to set the company on a course to achieve its previous premium status of performance. Today I will give you a brief update on our progress on that nine-point plan. The first action was to resize our manufacturing footprint. Tempe Fab 2 is now closed. The actions in our other two fabs, namely Fab 4 in Oregon and Fab 5 in Colorado Springs are complete. The actions in our back end Philippines facilities are also complete. These actions reduce capacity but leaves the fabs in a position to ramp capacity rapidly when needed on short notice. The second action was to reduce our inventory. Our inventory at the end of December 2024 was 266 days. Our target inventory is 130 to 150 days. Our inventory at March 31, 2025 was 251 days, making it the first meaningful reduction in days of inventory in three years. In the March quarter, we had reduced production for only part of the quarter. We will have reduced production for all of the June quarter. Thus, we expect to reduce inventory more substantially in this June quarter. The inventory at the end of June is expected to be between 215 and 225 days. During the fiscal year 2026 ending March 31, 2026 our goal is to reduce inventory by over $350 million which will liberate cash. The third action was a review of our megatrends and total system solution. We made two changes to our megatrends. First, we replaced 5G with artificial intelligence and second we replaced ADAS with Network and Connectivity. ADAS is now part of Network and Connectivity which is essentially the movement of data outside of the data center such as Industry 4.0 and Automotive Networking. The fourth action was to conduct a business unit by business unit deep dive. This was completed and resulting organization changes were made. The fifth action was a review of Microchip's channel strategy. This action was also completed and resulting changes have been made in our channel strategy. We have not seen any negative impact from these changes in our distribution channel. The sixth point of evaluation was to strengthen our customer relationships. We met with over 700 customers in the past 130 plus days, giving customers a chance to communicate with us candidly. The results are in based on customer feedback. Recall that we had said that at 12% of the customers our relationship had deteriorated through the COVID cycle. Within this 12% we have already been able to restore 78% of these customers to either approved or preferred status, leaving only 2.6% of the customers where our relationship remains stressed and in need of more restoration effort. At this point, we will continue to work our customer relationships as a normal course of business and believe that this concern is closed and behind us. Point seven was the long-term business model which we unveiled on March 3. Point eight was achieving our operating expense model. We completed a global layoff of approximately 10% of our employees to bring our expenses down. We plan to continue to improve our operating expense percentage through revenue growth, attrition and controlling other operating expenses. The ninth and final area was the CHIPS Act activity. We reinitiated our discussions with the CHIPS Office. The CHIPS Office is still reorganizing under the new administration. With that, I will pass the call over to Eric Bjornholt.
Eric Bjornholt: Thanks Steve and good afternoon everyone. We are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go over some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share based compensation, and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliation on our website. Net sales in the March quarter were $970.5 million, which was down 5.4% sequentially and $10.5 million above the midpoint of our guidance provided on February 6, 2025. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 52% including capacity underutilization charges of $54.2 million. Operating expenses were at 38% of sales and operating income was 14% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $61.4 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.11 which was $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis in the March quarter, gross margins were 51.6%. Total operating expenses were $601.4 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $122.6 million, special charges of $71.6 million which was primarily driven by foundry contract exit costs and employee separation costs. Share based compensation was $37.2 million and $1.4 million of other expenses. The GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders was $156.8 million or $0.29 per share. For fiscal year 2025 net sales were $4.402 billion and were down 42.3% from net sales in fiscal year 2024. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57%, operating expenses were 32.5% of sales and operating income was 24.5% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $708.8 million and EPS was $1.31 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 56.1%. Operating expenses were 49.3% of sales and operating income was 6.7% of sales. The GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders was $2.7 million. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 13.6% in the March quarter and 14.2% for fiscal year 2025. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2026 is expected to be about 12% which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. Our inventory balance at March 31, 2025 was $1.293 billion and was down $62.8 million from the balance at December 31, 2024. We had 251 days of inventory at the end of the March quarter which was down 15 days from the prior quarter's level driven by our inventory reduction actions. Included in our March ending inventory was 18 days of a long life cycle high margin products whose manufacturing capacity has been end of life by our supply chain partners. Inventory at our distributors in the March quarter was at 33 days which was down four days from the prior quarter's level. Distribution took down their inventory in the March quarter as distribution sell through was about $103 million higher than distribution sell in. Our cash flow from operating activities was $205.9 million in the March quarter. Our adjusted free cash flow was $182.6 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $771.7 million. In the March quarter we completed a $1.485 billion mandatory convertible preferred stock offering with a three-year term and purchased a cap call that is generally expected to reduce or offset potential dilution to the common stock upon conversion of the preferred stock with such reduction subject to an initial cap price of $71.40 per share. The mandatory preferred convertible transaction was done to reduce our debt and preserve our investment grade rating. Our total Debt decreased by $1.125 billion in the March quarter and our net debt decreased by $1.31 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA in the March quarter was $200.4 million and 20.6% of net sales. Our trailing twelve-month adjusted EBITDA was $1.337 billion and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was $3.66 at March 31, 2025. Capital expenditures were $14.2 million in the March quarter and $126 million for fiscal year 2025. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2026 is to be at or below $100 million. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $41.2 million. I will now turn it over to Rich who will provide some commentary on our product line innovations in the March quarter. Rich?
Richard Simoncic: Thank you, Eric and good afternoon everyone. During this quarter we have continued to execute our strategic initiatives that deliver value across multiple markets. Our investments in next generation technologies like the Switchtec PCIe switches enable us to adapt and deploy technologies initially developed for high speed data centers into automotive and embedded computing applications. These advancements create new capabilities in applications where accelerated communication performance is critical such as software defined vehicles and robotics. We are strengthening our core portfolio through advancements in our ARM-based microprocessors for human machine interface applications and our 32 bit microcontrollers integrated with high performance analog peripherals that serve industrial, consumer, medical and AIML markets. These high speed peripherals and other analog related functionality reduce the need for external analog components, decrease system complexity and cost and deliver high performance solutions. Our innovative MPLAB AI coding assistant is helping customers accelerate their design cycles, reducing their embedded software development time and increasing productivity by as much as 40%. We continue to enhance this tool with additional features and functionality. Additionally, our new PIC64 product line continues to gain momentum and new design opportunities for the Space, Industrial Automation, Automotive and Edge Compute. Our recently launched 10BASE-T1S solutions continue to see market adoption with a growing design funnel. These innovations coupled with our operational efficiency efforts demonstrate our commitment to driving top line growth and improved profitability as we continue to bringing differentiated solutions to our target markets. With that, I will pass the call to Steve for comments about our business and guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Rich. As Eric described in his prepared remarks, our March quarter net sales were $970.5 million, down 5.4% sequentially and down 26.8% from the year ago quarter as we navigated through a very large inventory correction following a post-COVID super cycle. Our revenue from our microcontroller and analog business units was down sequentially. FPGA was about flat and other businesses were up sequentially, mainly driven by technology licensing. Geographically, our business was seasonally down sequentially in Americas and Asia and was seasonally up in Europe. Now let's get into our guidance for the June quarter. We believe substantial inventory destocking has occurred at our customers, channel partners and their downstream customers. While we believe the inventory at our customers, channel partners and downstream customers will continue to correct, the customers and distributors are starting to increase their purchases. As a result, I am finally calling the last quarter as a revenue bottom for us. Our bookings were up significantly in the March quarter after nearly three years of book-to-bill ratio well below 1.0. Our book-to-bill ratio in the March quarter was a very healthy 1.07. Our backlog for the June quarter started out higher than the starting backlog for the March quarter. The bookings in the month of April were higher than any month in the March quarter. Taking all of these factors into account, we expect our net sales for the June quarter to be $1.045 billion plus or minus $25 million. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 52.2% and 54.2% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 33.4% and 34.8% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating profit to be between 17.4% and 20.8% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.18 and $0.26. There are a couple of things I want to highlight in our guidance. The first is the leverage in our business model. With a $74.5 million increase in net sales at the midpoint of the guidance for the June quarter, we are taking approximately 85% of it to the bottom line as non-GAAP operating profit. As the inventory drains further and inventory write-offs decrease, our gross margin recovery will accelerate and with the incremental profits going to the bottom line, we will have tremendous leverage. The second point I wanted to make is on the revenue growth. There are three revenue accelerators kicking in just from the inventory drain. The first is that our distributor's inventory and our distributor customer's inventory is getting corrected. We're expecting the first increase in distributor sell-through after many quarters. Therefore, our distributors are starting to buy more product to replenish their inventory and feed their customers growth. Second, the distributor sell-in has to rise to meet the sales out. Last quarter sell-in revenue was $103 million lower than sell-through. If sell-in revenue were to catch up with sell-through, the sell-in revenue will rise approximately $103 million higher and will further feed sales growth. And third, our direct customers inventory is getting corrected and we're starting to see the direct customer shipments increase. We believe that this trifecta effect is a compelling setup for sales growth going into this fiscal year. With sales growth, gross margin increasing and inventory declining, we expect to deliver significantly improved financial performance in this fiscal year. Now let me provide an update on our capital return program for shareholders. We are essentially returning 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to investors in the form of dividends right now. Due to depressed net sales, our adjusted free cash flow is currently less than our dividend. In certain quarters we have had to make higher bond interest payments and tax payments and bond interest payments are generally made every six months. So every other quarter this impacts our adjusted free cash flow and results in our dividend exceeding our adjusted free cash flow. As we begin to liberate cash from inventory, coupled with very low capital expenditures, we expect to bring the adjusted free cash flow above the dividend. In future quarters we intend to use this excess cash to bring our borrowings back down to at least the levels they were at before our dividend exceeded our adjusted free cash flow. We're not considering any cut to the dividend. Our financial activity last quarter in which we raised $1.4 billion in a mandatory convertible preferred transaction, improved our balance sheet and reaffirmed our investment grade debt rating. With that operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.
Harsh Kumar: Yes. Hey Steve. First of all, let me add my congratulations to the recovery. I know it's been a long time coming, but we've seen you call bottoms in the past and I'm excited that you see the bottom. But the question we get, Steve though, from a lot of our clients, our investors, is that maybe talk about the demand signals that you're seeing, which you kind of did, but there is also another aspect of maybe potential pull-ins from tariffs. If you could just help us understand why this may not be a head fake from that? And then also if you could just, I'll ask my second question here. If you could just talk about the recovery that you're seeing relative to your key end markets, if there's one that's acting better than the other or they're both acting the same?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Harsh. You know the demand signals we are seeing really began starting early January. Our January, February, March, each of those three months bookings were significantly higher than December quarter bookings and we have shown them on a slide on the March 3 conference call that we had and that was really before any of the tariffs talk appeared. So we're really not seeing any tariff related activity or pull-in. If you look at downstream customers’ information, many of the direct customers that were not buying the product are starting to buy it because their inventory is getting depleted. Same way at the distributors, they are starting to buy additional amount of product because on many of the SKUs their inventory has gone back to very much normal and our distributors customers also downstream customers, their inventory is getting corrected. So all of the signals we have really are related to that and number of large number of designs that we were designed in last year, many of them are turning to production. So there is also growth coming from new products and new design win activity. We haven't seen any impact of tariffs. The tariffs are largely exempted on all the semiconductors that we make today, whether shipping into China or shipping into U.S.
Harsh Kumar: The second one was related to the key end markets.
Steve Sanghi: So if we look at the last year's data, fiscal year 2025 ending March 31, the notable thing that stands out is the aerospace and defense. The aerospace and defense used to be 11% of our business in the prior year. In fiscal 2025, that is now 17%, 18%, and it's almost the second largest market now after industrial. And the underlying reasons are that business has stayed strong, defense budgets have been high. NATO has been increasing their defense spending and with two wars going on, while the automotive, industrial, communication, consumer, other businesses were weak. So that is a notable shift in our end market. And if you look at the year that just started on April 1, I think we're headed for the first ever over a trillion dollars budget for U.S. Defense. And I recently met a customer from Europe and the talk of the, you know, talk was around, they were talking about their business growing 2x to 3x over the next three years because U.S. was pushing NATO to dramatically increase their defense spending and they are a major contractor to NATO and European defense. So I think the opportunities in that segment are very good even this year and we think that will be a very good segment. Now all the others, industrial, automotive, consumers and others, we are seeing a broad based recovery in all of those segments embedded in our bookings, fair amount driven by inventory depletion and also driven by new designs and new products.
Harsh Kumar: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions, Chris.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good evening. I guess the first question, and we've been discussing this quite a bit with others during this earnings season is what sort of macro impact that the tariff environment such will have as we go into the rest of the year? And Steve, I'm judging by your comments about improving bookings and that you're not seeing that, but I guess the question is what are your customers telling you right now? And from an investor standpoint, there's been concern about pull-ins of demand from second half to now to get ahead of tariffs. What's your view on that?
Steve Sanghi: So I think there are two things. There is a direct impact of tariffs like the tariffs on our products as they ship anywhere into China or U.S. and then there is the indirect effect which is the effect on global economy and global GDP. The second one impact on global GDP is below my -- is above my pay grade. The customers that I have met in the last couple of weeks personally, when I ask them how you're thinking about tariffs, they turn around and asking me how do I think about tariffs? And nobody knows because as we speak today there are really no tariffs on the semiconductors. So leaving that impact on the global GDP aside and I'll comment a little more on that afterwards, if you look at the direct impact on us, it's basically nothing. In Donald Trump's first term, he implemented 25% tariffs on semiconductors made in China coming into U.S. At that time, about 10% or 11% of our parts were made in China, and we moved aggressively to move that production assembly essentially from China to Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, others. And Today, less than 4% of our parts are made in China, and those don't come to U.S. They go to Europe, they go to Japan, they go to Southeast Asia. A handful of orders that made in China that might come to U.S. which may become subject to tariff, basically, we passed that tariff to the customers, but it was negligible because it was really very small. Now, the other thing is, if there is a tariff for U.S. made product going to China, and we're looking at it all, parsing it together very carefully, many of our technologies run in U.S. and they also run in Taiwan, and we'll try to portion our production so that the parts that are going into China are made in Taiwan or Europe or elsewhere and are not made in U.S. and I'm sure we'll find that it's not 100%, it's a very small amount. So I'm really not that concerned about the direct tariffs because of that setup. Now, when it comes to indirect tariff, really nobody knows what the overall impact on the economy would be. So what we did for a modeling purpose inside is we took a hypothetical haircut on our revenue and we wanted to make sure that if that kind of impact were to happen, what would happen to the inventory? What would happen to our manufacturing? Would we have to take additional actions? And the result of that very stressed case analysis is that we have already cut back our manufacturing so much that with this haircut, our inventory is still declining slower than in the normal plan but inventory is declining because the production rate today would still be lower than the worst case scenario that we have modeled. Therefore, there will be no other actions required. We simply would ramp our factories later because the inventory is dropping slower. That's the answer to your question.
Chris Caso: It's a very helpful color. Thank you. As my follow up question, I wanted to dig in a little bit to the margin leverage that you referred to in your prepared remarks as well, and maybe two parts of that question. One is, if you could discuss some of the charges that are acting as headwinds to gross margin now, some of the underutilization charges and the reserve charges. And you know, with the assumption that revenue starts to come back now, how does that play out over the next few quarters and how is that leverage realized as the revenue comes back?
Eric Bjornholt: All right. Hey Chris, this is Eric. So the two main headwinds that we have right now are the underutilization charges, which were a little over $54 million last quarter. We don't expect that to really change significantly in the current quarter. We're still going to be running the factories at a low rate as we're focused on bringing inventory down. And then the inventory reserve charges, which we provided a little bit more color on March 3, and we went through the nine-point plan. Those are still big numbers and we expect that inventory reserve number to still be large again in the current quarter, but they are going to start dropping pretty dramatically as revenue increases. Assuming that's what happens as we go through the fiscal year because inventory is dropping at a rapid pace. Steve mentioned that we're targeting reducing inventory by about $350 million plus in the fiscal year. So the products that are really subject to review for reserve charge is coming down dramatically. So that should start changing pretty soon outside of this quarter and the leverage in gross margin is going to be really high. So we aren't putting numbers around it for investors today, but it's significant.
Chris Caso: Thank you.
Operator: Thank You. The next question comes from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Please proceed with your questions, Timothy.
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you. So Eric, just on that point, so given all the actions you've taken, if we sort of get back to a point where, I mean pick your revenue number, maybe like mid ones back to 1.5 or something like that, with all the actions you've taken and you assume that the reserves come down and underutilization comes down too, should we expect margins to be higher this time around than they were at the same revenue level last time? I mean, you've closed three fabs, so I would think that ultimately margins will be higher at equivalent revenue than they were last cycle, is that fair?
Eric Bjornholt: So it depends on the slope of the recovery. And I think you said we closed two fabs, we did not. We've only closed one fab, Fab 2 in Tempe. But it depends on the slope of recovery and then where we're at in terms of needing to ramp our factories. We have higher cost inventory per unit sitting in inventory today and that will come out on a FIFO basis. But the cost structure is in really good shape. Obviously we gave a new long-term model of 65% non-GAAP gross margins, which we're very confident in and I know all of you will be looking on how to model this going forward, but the leverage is significant. But I don't want to commit at this point in time in terms of a margin level at a comparable revenue level in the past. It will depend on the slope of how revenue returns there.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, and then Steve, do you have a way to determine what consumption is in June relative to your guidance? I know distributor sell-through is finally growing in June. I would think that distributor sell-is still going to be below sell-through in June. There is still some sort of slower moving MCU parts that seem to be moving a little slower. So where do you think consumption is for June relative to what you're guiding revenue?
Steve Sanghi: So your internal modeling shows that the distributor sell-through will be higher than the guidance we have given you, which is GAAP guidance based on sell-in. Last quarter that difference was $103 million. We expect the difference would be lower than that. How much lower, we can't quantify, but will be below 100. Certainly maybe well below 100. And that the gap will continue to close in the coming quarters which will result into one of the things that are trifecta I talked about where the sell-in will close to equal to sell-through. It's not the sell-through coming down, it's a sell-in going up. And the second part of the consumption is on the factory side. What are we producing and what are we consuming? And we have looked at it in our model based on our June quarter guidance, we are consuming lot of inventory and producing significantly less than what we are consuming from the inventory. So therefore, the inventory will continue to come down at an accelerated pace, which will eventually lower the write-offs and it will eventually improve the factory utilization and all of those will move in the right direction as the inventory continues to come down.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay thanks, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions, Blayne.
Blayne Curtis: Hey guys. Good afternoon. I have two questions. I wanted to ask about kind of big picture. Your cadence has been different than other companies. If you kind of look at MCU share, maybe you guys gained a little bit too much share during the pandemic and now your share looks quite low as you're correcting while others aren't correcting as much. I'm just kind of curious as you kind of look through here and there's been a lot of talk about share gainers in MCUs. Kind of just curious, when things normalize, do you expect to get back to where you were pre-pandemic?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we certainly expect to gain share and it's a quarter at a time, but we certainly plan to gain share on the way up here as we recover. I think competitors are more closer to a full recovery than we are. I mean, we just began, this is the first quarter, so therefore we should be gaining share.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks. I want to ask you, there's a lot of kind of debate about China's strategy and I guess who knows how all this trade war works out. And I'm not sure they are tariffing semis in China, but I think there are a handful of companies looking to do a China for China strategy. I'm just kind of curious your perspective if you think that's the right move or the wrong move. I think you're starting to hear that ASPs are lower because the costs are lower, so it might be a headwind for the overall market if that's what everybody does, just curious your perspective.
Steve Sanghi: Well, if you go back to the March 3, report we gave to the Street, we talked about our China for China strategy in that report and that was built around, we have a Chinese partner with a Chinese name and Chinese logo, a Chinese website, a Chinese data sheet, and we were going to sell our die to that Chinese partner and then they were going to locally assemble and test it and put a locally made logo and then sell it to Chinese customers as a local part. But the die inside was microchip. Now there was a time when the rules were made in China meant assembled in China, and since then the rules are sort of being changed, where made in China or made in U.S. is where it is diffused, which means where it is fabbed, not where it's assembled. So with that rule change, our made in China strategy, which was parts made in our fabs here assembled in China and shipping China as a local product, that really doesn't work. So we are redoing our China strategy. We could still do that based on parts made in Taiwan and we can transfer some of the other products from U.S. to Taiwan. So we'll be redoing the strategy and talk to you at a later point. A point I'd like to make on record, which we are communicating to the Trump administration, to Secretary of Commerce and all that, is that the current rules are actually incentivizing moving product out of U.S., which is opposite of what they intended. They were trying to get more people to make parts in U.S. And we are moving mask sets as we speak from U.S. to Taiwan, wherever we have dual source so that we don't have to pay a tariff going into China. So we'll come back to you on the China for China strategy.
Blayne Curtis: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your questions, Vivek.
Vivek Arya: Thank you for taking my questions. On the first one related to gross margins and then pricing, so March quarter gross margins were I think kind of at the lower end of your outlook even though sales were slightly above, so just anything to call there? And in general, Steve, what are you assuming for the pricing environment this year versus say three months ago?
Steve Sanghi: The pricing environment we have assumed is basically mid-single digit type of decrease.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. And I think on your question on gross margin, why it came in on the lower end versus when sales were above the midpoint? It's a number of factors, but the bottom line is we continue to aggressively tried to reduce inventory. So our utilization was low and our inventory reserve charges were still high. So it's really a combination of those factors.
Vivek Arya: All right. And for my follow-up, Steve, you're calling June an inflection quarter. How should this inform us about your visibility for one quarter out in September? Like if we had to think about September, should we be thinking given that June is an inflection, that September should be seasonal, above seasonal, should it kind of be, you know, in the same range as June? Because you know, modeling your business when it is going through these periods of inflection gets really tough. So I would appreciate any help that you could provide in how we should be thinking about quarter plus one for your business?
Steve Sanghi: So you know, if we look at September quarter backlog today and compare it to the June quarter backlog at the same point in time, which means June 8, just go back a quarter and what June quarter would be at the same point in time a quarter ago. The September backlog is higher than where June quarter was at the same point in time. And the slope of the fill on the crawl chart looks quite good. So if I were to say today, I'm quite optimistic about the September quarter.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Please proceed with your questions, Tore.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. So Steve, one of the organization changes was to combine the 8 and 32-bit microcontroller development tools under one group. I was just wondering if you could clarify and talk a bit more about what was behind that particular change and how that might impact your share in the overall microcontroller market?
Steve Sanghi: So the change was not combining the 8-bit and 32-bit development tools. The change was combining 8-bit and 32-bit business units, the product group. The development tool was only was always one common group, but they reported in a way that they were not totally aligned with 8 and 32-bit. The reason for the change that came out during my deep dives was 8-bit was pursuing 8-bit opportunities and 32-bit was pursuing 32-bit opportunities and nobody was minding the store as some of the 8-bit customers wanted to convert to 32-bit. So the 32-bit group was doing a lot of middle end and high end products and leaving the low end of 32-bit vulnerable. So when an 8-bit customer wanted to move to a low end 32-bit, we didn't have the appropriate product. So 8-bit will keep fighting with 8-bit trying to compete with 8-bit, but customer was trying to go to 32-bit. Remember this 8-bit to 32-bit conversion now has been talked about for about 35 years. People were talking to me about that conversion back in 1994 and it didn't happen for forever, but it did happen during COVID. It accelerated. Parts were hard to find, so people found whatever they did and whatever parts they could find anywhere. And so a lot more designs were able to fulfill their needs with 32-bit and they stayed with 32-bit and going forward they have adopted 32-bit. So since combination of those business units, we have changed the developmental priorities to fill that hole. And the first of those products will be introduced to the market in early January. And we're already working with the customers to design it in because customers can design in using one of the other products because the architectures are very compatible and they would be ready to go in production with our product when it is released. So that was the change we made.
Tore Svanberg: That's great color. As my follow up for Eric. Eric, the $90 million to $100 million in operating expenses that you're saving from the recent restructuring, could you just talk a little bit about the linearity of that? I mean obviously some of it is already played out and we can see that in the numbers. But any more color you could offer us for those savings as we move into fiscal 2026?
Eric Bjornholt: Yes, I would say most of it is already played in. Right? If you look at where our OpEx came in for the March quarter compared to forecast, I think it was $7 million or $8 million below what our guidance to the Street was because we implemented the RIF beginning in early March. And so most of those actions were fully reflected in the guidance that we gave today for the June quarter. There still might be little small pieces to go, but most of those actions are completed at this point in time.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Thank you very much.
Eric Bjornholt: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your questions, Harlan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, you already got the question on tariff related pull ins and you mentioned indirect impact is above your pay grade. But to be fair, this is a team, right? If you look back in the 2018, 2019 U.S. China tariff and trade conflict, the microchip team was actually the first to call out seeing order patterns dropping within your China industrial and manufacturing customers due to the demand uncertainty caused by tariff impact at that time. In fact, the team has somewhat of a unique profile of having very large exposure to like small and medium sized manufacturers and they tend to modulate their activity fairly quickly and in real time. So given the current trade and tariff dynamics, are you starting to see any signs of a pullback or perturbations in order activity from your small, medium sized China manufacturing and industrial base?
Steve Sanghi: So Harlan, I don't recall between then and now, I retired for about a few years, so I don't recall what happened, but I think the tariffs were very pointed at that time only for China. This time, tariffs are a lot broader in the whole world and people are still going to be buying cars and washers and dryers and equipment and appliances. And what we do see is people from China, our customers in China, rapidly moving production from China to outside of China. For example, a lot of our development tools were made in China and our supplier who builds a development tool, our contract manufacturer, has moved their facility to Vietnam. So a lot of those changes are happening and they're accelerating now, but they've been happening for five years because this, you know, this thing, Trump has been saying that for two years now during all his campaigns, so this is not new. So therefore we just think that people are going to continue to build these products, but there'll be a lot of movements out of China. So China may have a problem, but the world may not have as big a problem.
Harlan Sur: I appreciate that. And then on the sixth megatrend focus, from fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2024, megatrend revenues grew at a 26% CAGR. Right? That's about 2x the growth of the overall microchip business represented about 47% of your revenues. Can you guys just true us up? So what was the performance megatrend revenues versus your total sales in fiscal 2025? And what was the percentage mix of the megatrend revenues in fiscal 2025?
Steve Sanghi: Rich?
Richard Simoncic: So our megatrend mix has pretty much held the same in terms of overall revenue growth. In terms of overall percentage growth, that trend has diminished or slowed down. Megatrends are still growing above the microchip rate in terms of CAGR, but with all of the inventory correction megatrends were just as susceptible to inventory correction as our standard markets.
Harlan Sur: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Joshua Buchalter from TD Cowen. Please proceed with your questions, Joshua.
Joshua Buchalter: Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question. You've been pretty transparent about your limited visibility as we kind of went through the thick of the inventory digestion the last few quarters and clearly there's been a lot of digestion and I realize we touched on it a bit, but I was wondering if you could maybe comment on what's improved from a visibility standpoint that's allowing you to conclusively say we've hit the bottom here? I mean is it simply that the bookings have gotten high enough where you're able to get a better pulse on true end demand and consumption versus inventory situation? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: I think there are many pieces of it, you know and so one of them is the distribution. Sales out is increasing after many, many quarters. So distribution is selling more to their end customers, which means in some cases the end customer's inventory is getting corrected so distribution is shipping more, so that's one. Number two, the bookings in March quarter were up significantly from any prior quarter and bookings in April were higher than any other month, January, February or March. That's number two. And number three, when you look at the crawl chart, so crawl chart essentially on a daily basis looks at what we have billed for the quarter and what do we have bookings aged in the quarter. So if no more bookings come in in the quarter, that's the number we're going to be for the quarter. And you can compare those crawl charts, you know, one quarter versus the other at the same point in time. So the June quarter starting backlog was higher than March quarter on the first day of the quarter. And if I look at it now on May 8th and compare it to February 8th, the backlog for June quarter on May 8th is substantially higher than at the same point in time on February 8th. And then when you look at the backlog for the September quarter compared to March or compared to June, it's higher than both of them. And slope at which it's increasing is also higher, which means customers are increasingly thinking of buying more because either the inventory is correcting or they have a new product that's going into production. So it's multifaceted.
Joshua Buchalter: Thank you for all the color there. And I think you mentioned more sustained shutdowns in the June quarter. Can you elaborate on how you're thinking about the cadence of this? I think in the past you've done some two-week ones and clearly you're getting more aggressive now. Should we think about sort of the sustained lower production levels until you hit, I think it's 130 to 150 day on books, inventory targets and similar where you feel comfortable in the channel? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: So there are two factories where we are still working a little bit of rotating time off. One is an Oregon facility where we could have brought it down further, but we didn't bring it up as low because it will get below a critical mass. We brought it to a point lower and then we're running a two weeks rotating time off out of 13. The reason for that is, that is the factory where all our advanced products are. And by having a two weeks rotating time off, we can ramp it very rapidly by just removing the rotating time off. We're not doing the same thing in Colorado. We're not doing the same thing in Philippines. That facility was unique in the products it builds, why we decided to do it that way. Now our plan is to run the production at these levels, which is well below really what we are shipping today, so that the inventory could come down. But your last part of your question is, would we continue to run this way until our inventory comes down to 130 to 150 days and the answer to that is not. And the reason for that is if you wait until the inventory comes down to 130 to 150 days, then for the following quarter your inventory can't decline anymore because you really cannot size. You may have to grow your capacity 40%, 50% in a single quarter because we are running so much below consumption plus revenues growing. So therefore you have to model it where you have to start growing capacity or start growing production few quarters ahead of time, so you don't have a hill to climb that you can't climb in rehiring and retraining people.
Eric Bjornholt: So we don't believe that inflection point is in this quarter or next quarter. But as we progress through the fiscal year, we could get there where we need to start and start ramping the factories.
Joshua Buchalter: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from William Stein from Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions, William.
William Stein: Great, thank you. Steve, I appreciate all the clarifications you've provided. I wanted to dig into the earlier question about China for China and as I recall the business update from the March time frame, I felt that you talked about some of the products in your portfolio no longer being meaningfully competitive in China, especially I think what you characterize as standard products. And I thought that was the reason for this partnership that now it sounds like that strategy has changed. So can you talk about your competitive positioning in China going forward and how if some of your products are less competitive, how that influences the total, I think it's called total solution selling strategy that you have? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: I think, I don't know if you misunderstood, but I don't think we set up products as competitives. There is a push from the Chinese Government to the local industry to design in the local products and so a lot of the customers want to use a local product to check that box. Now when we talk to the customers, they like the Western product better than the local product, but they're under pressure from Chinese Government. So if you can provide them the product with Western quality, Western design, Western spec, but under a local brand, then you get the best of both worlds. So that's what we were trying to do, to provide our Western made product under a Chinese logo from a local company. And many of the customers were telling, yes that's exactly what I want. Now what happened then is that they changed the definition of what it is made of. It used to be assemblies where the product is formed, changes shape significantly and they redefine that to where it is diffused, which means where it is fabbed. So therefore all of the U.S. made product won't fit into the China for China strategy. All of our products made in Taiwan and Germany and Japan and everywhere else will fit, but you know, that's not a complete portfolio. So we're redoing that strategy and may land up building relationships with some of our U.S. made products are also made in Taiwan or elsewhere, but I don't want to rush to it. We are already transferring some of our mask sets where the process already runs in Taiwan at one of the foundries. But we're not forming new relationships to transfer of a U.S. product, instead we're giving feedback to the government that the strategy is having an opposite effect where there's an incentive to move U.S. production out. But if there is no change in the strategy and the current rules continue another few weeks, then we will probably start to move some U.S. production elsewhere.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes Will, I think maybe where some of the confusion came is, we talked about how where we have seen some and may see more competition over time from China based companies and semiconductors is in the kind of the lower end of the standard microcontroller and analog products. But we won't see it in kind of our higher end, more complex products, at least not in the near term.
William Stein: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your questions, Vijay.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes, hi, Steve and Eric. Just a quick question. Under Section 232 talking about bringing product back to the U.S., what are you contemplating? How are you looking at that? What's the time frame for that? Thanks. And I have a follow-up.
Steve Sanghi: Time frame for what?
Vijay Rakesh: Just wondering if you're expecting any Section 232 rulings coming down in terms of trying to bring product back to the U.S.
Steve Sanghi: Well, I just finished explaining that we're taking product from U.S. to elsewhere. The current rules are such that produce the product anywhere but don't produce them in China and don't produce them in U.S. You're in best shape if you stay away from U.S. and you stay away from China because China hates U.S. and U.S. hates China. So if you produce elsewhere, you're loved by everybody else. So I think those are the rules the way I understand it today. But you know, we are -- the rules are changing every day and we will do whatever the appropriate thing to do is. We have fair amount of overlap in our products where we produce them in U.S. and produce them in Taiwan on many of our products and some other products, we produce them in Germany and we produce them in Japan. But as the rules continue to change, we will evolve that strategy to ensure that we're best positioned with whatever the final rules are.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And then talking about visibility, just wondering how you're looking at utilization, I guess, across the fabs as you go to the back half, if you have some visibility there in terms of demand or how we should see that going? Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: So, you know, so we guided that the June quarter inventory is somewhere between 215 and 225 days. You know, and if I just kind of project ahead in September, I think it drops below 200. I don't know what the exact number would be. And our goal is 130 to 150 days longer-term. So somewhere between that 150 and 200 there is a number at which we need to start rehiring people and start growing production. Because if we wait till the inventory gets into that band, then we'll have to create the full output of a quarter fresh without being able to take it from the inventory. It could be a growth unachievable because that's a hill to climb. So we understand that how much we can grow per quarter. And based on that model, we think we will start growing the production well before it hits 150 days.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham & Co. Please proceed with your questions, Quinn.
Quinn Bolton: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, just a quick follow up on that last question. As you guys start to -- you get below the 200 days, somewhere between 200 and 150, obviously you start increasing production. Is that where you could see the incremental margin that you talked about being 85% in the June quarter? Is that where it could start to tick even higher or is there a scenario where you could see better than 85% incremental margins before that point, maybe just because of the reduction in inventory reserves? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: You know, there are a lot of moving parts. There are a lot of moving parts. As the inventory comes down, your write-offs go away because even the slow moving parts are no longer higher than 18 months of inventory. Your utilization starts to improve when you ramp the fab. So there are a lot of moving parts, but I think we can roughly keep that sort of incremental margin falling to the bottom for a few quarters. That's sort of the best I can describe.
Quinn Bolton: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Danely from Citibank. Please proceed with your questions, Chris.
Christopher Danely: Hey, thanks, guys. Steve or Eric, just a question on the inventory write-downs, write-offs, et cetera, et cetera, how much of that has been written off, written down, and then when will you start to sell that and what's the impact going to be on the P&L for planning purposes?
Eric Bjornholt: Well, it's a bit unpredictable on when we will see it. Right? If we had an order on the backlog today, we wouldn't have written it off this last quarter. So it's just based on the pattern of orders that come in. We know that we are building very long life products that are going to sell over time. It's just that predicting that is difficult. But every quarter we have some sell through of previously written off inventory. And because we've written off so much over the last five or six quarters, that tailwind to gross margin is going to come. We don't necessarily think that's happening this quarter, but I think as we progress through fiscal 2026, we're going to start to see benefits of that.
Christopher Danely: Okay, thanks Eric. And then as a follow-up, so either Steve or Rich, you know Steve, now that you've been there for several months, how would you, I guess what would be your take on just Microchip's product positioning in the microcontroller market? Maybe you know how it's gone over the last year or so? Do you think that anything needs to change? Do you guys think you need to add on anything to the product lines or do anything differently or is it sort of autopilot right now? Just appreciate your thoughts on the market share and the product positioning.
Steve Sanghi: Well, I mean there's certainly nothing autopilot. There is an extreme sense of urgency. Rich and I have brought back to the groups and we've made a number of organization changes. The 8-bit combining with 32-bit is the most visible to you, but we made other changes across the company and there is a new sense of vigor and a new sense of urgency. And you're starting to see essentially when I look across the company, every indicator is starting to move in the right direction. Revenue growth, gross margin growth, operating margin growth, EPS growth, inventory reduction, product schedules, pricing, everything else is really just lining up. Customer counts, so all those things are happening. So it's nothing business as usual. But I think when it gets to specific product, you can't have a CEO admit on a conference call to all the competitors that his products are XYZ. No, our products are great, but where we missed the boat was in some of the 8-bit to 32-bit transition at the low end and I did admit that. I highlighted that and we're correcting it. But no, beyond that, I think our products are good.
Richard Simoncic: Yes, there's more to this conversion too. Even in development tools, we're going to make it much easier for customers to move between our product lines, a great deal of automation is being given to our customers to help them design in our products. So we are moving very aggressively on a number of fronts here very aggressively.
Steve Sanghi: So one other thing I would highlight is really kind of on the development tools. So the, you know, the past strategy was that Microchip has its own unique development platform on 32-bit microcontroller that was harmony and customers have to adopt that development platform to design with our products. Now that was required when our products were either the proprietary architecture which the third parties didn't support, or when very originally we were trying to do MIPS based products which were not supported by the third party ecosystem. Since we now are doing most of our 32-bit products on ARM-based architecture, most large customers are using either Keil or IAR or many a number of these development platforms which are pretty standard. So Microchip was pushing its own platform to the people who already had a platform. This providing a sort of resistance path for adopting our products. So I think what we have done very recently is change that strategy and now we are up and running to all of these third party platforms. So therefore when we go into a large customer, we just have to position our products and not ask them to change their development platform. And that has really dropped one barrier and we're succeeding, getting new designs.
Christopher Danely: All right, thanks a lot guys, that's great.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Joe.
Joe Moore: Great, thank you. I know the dividend has always been a big priority. Is there any scenario where you could see that coming down in different economic circumstances? I'm just asking, I get the question a lot.
Steve Sanghi: So, you know, there is a absolute commitment that dividend reduction has not been a consideration. When we were threatened that our debt rating could be downgraded, we took strong action last quarter by raising this $1.45 billion mandatory convert and brought our debt level down by about $1.1 billion. With that, we reaffirmed our investment grade rating by both rating agencies and kept the dividend intact. Now, as we look at it going forward, with our revenue increasing, cash getting liberated from inventory, gross margins rising, we're talking about 85% of the incremental revenue fall through. I don't really think we're in a situation where there is risk. So I think we have put that behind us.
Joe Moore: Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you. And then I've also gotten questions on the non-GAAP adjustments. The preferred dividend coming out of the non-GAAP numbers. Can you just describe the rationale for that?
Eric Bjornholt: Well, it's a dividend, right? So for GAAP accounting purposes, the preferred dividend is shown on the income statement. But there are many companies that have these mandatory preferreds in place and exclude them from the non-GAAP results because it's really an equity instrument, it's not a debt instrument.
Joe Moore: Got it. Makes sense. All right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Janet Ramkissoon from Quadra Capital. Please proceed with your questions, Janet.
Steve Sanghi: Hello Janet.
Janet Ramkissoon: Hi, Steve. Thanks. Great job and what you've been able to accomplish in such a short period of time. I wanted to drill down a little bit on the aerospace and defense. I was a little bit surprised that it's up to 18%. And there are a lot of changes in the defense area where we're seeing a lot of the traditional defense companies working more with some of the newer players in the market, SpaceX and the world industries and guys who are making drones and robots. Can you give me a sense of what your exposure is to some of these new markets? And I noticed you did say that one of the focus was to switch from 5G to AI. How does that tie into this defense business and addressing some of the newer opportunities with some of these more innovative players in the space?
Richard Simoncic: So, you know, good question on that. So when it comes to new space, we’ve been working with those customers for quite some time and now there's this new generation of new defense customers coming up. And what we've been doing is taking some of our products instead of RAD hard, you become RAD tolerant. We've been now introducing more plastics into our aerospace and defense product line and then working with our different product BUs to convert more products to that RAD tolerant or plastic product line that is more focused towards these new defense or new space customers.
Janet Ramkissoon: Could you give me a sense of how you characterize the opportunity for you? How large is it? Is this just a small thing or could this be eversion to a good growth area for you?
Steve Sanghi: So I think, Janet, all these new things is an opportunity and we're engaged with everyone. But I think where the real growth is going to come from is two factors. Number one, U.S. defense is talking about rebuilding its arsenal. You know, they are depleted on missiles and bullets and rifles and tanks and planes and everything is aging. Fleet is old. So there's going to be a substantial rebuilding of our defense arsenal and we are. in everything. There's nothing in our U.S. Defense. No battle tank, no plane, no missile, no nothing. That microchip is not in it. We are in everything. So I think that's where the growth comes in U.S. Now, you can add to that drones and SpaceX and all that, but those are not multibillion dollar opportunities. And the second piece on the growth is really what's happening in NATO. NATO is going to double and triple its budget over the next two years, three years, and because they're being pushed to really invest for their defense. So they are rebuilding their arsenal, rebuilding missiles and tanks and rifles and drones and radars and all that and we are in all that stuff. So we're already hearing from defense customers in Europe about a significant opportunity. Just about four weeks ago, one of the major customers from France heard about that we were closing Fab 2, you know, Tempe Fab, and he flew down to Chandler to come see me, confronting me on he's planning to double his business. Why am I closing fabs. Then I explained him that his Fabs products were not made in Fab 2. His products are RAD, hard or whatever. They're made in other fabs. And in one or two items that may be in Fab 2, we have inventory and we're transitioning them to other fabs. So you could kind of see that customers are looking for significant growth and they want to ensure that Microchip is in a position to meet their needs.
Janet Ramkissoon: Thanks, that's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna International. Please proceed with your questions, Christopher.
Christopher Rolland: Thanks for the question. I'll try to be brief. Steve, how do you see market share dynamics in Microchip, the actual MCU market playing out? Do you see China taking share? Are there any more formidable competitors and do you expect your share to increase? Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: I absolutely expect our share to increase in MCU in the coming couple of years and some of it is driven by many of our microcontroller customers that have been sitting on a significant inventory, haven't been buying the full boat of products. And just starting this quarter, we're starting to see increased bookings from them, increased purchasing from them. Our guidance for the June quarter is on the upper end of the industry, and I think the market share gains are reflected in them.
Christopher Rolland: Thank you, Steve. One other, and I apologize if this was asked, but AI as a percentage of revenue and you had a bunch of new looks like AI product announcements, optical, power, PCIe. Are you expecting any of these to be really needle moving and are of particular emphasis for you guys moving forward? Thanks.
Eric Bjornholt: So, you know, we continue to see as a percentage of sales that increasing. I think we had given a number last year that was about 4% of sales. As of the latest measurement, it's just over 6% of sales. So we continue to see strength in that particular marketplace for us and we continue to introduce new product lines within that area. In fact, one of the reorganizations that we did was we created an AIML product group to help. We've got almost eight different BUs within the company that need either models or model zoos or accelerators on their products. That group is helping coordinate that activity within the organization.
Christopher Rolland: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Ellis from B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your question, Craig.
Craig Ellis: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to go back to the point that Rich made earlier about the significant changes that Microchip had made to improve our product development and product development efficiency for customers. What I was hoping you could do is just share an example or two of what those changes are and more importantly, help us understand when would investors see the benefit of the changes that you've made and how material could they be in say 2026 and years beyond? Thank you.
Richard Simoncic: You know, that's a -- what we've helped customers do is essentially speed up their development time. And so, you know, it becomes a productivity tool in terms of time to market. So we've been training an internal model for almost two years in terms of writing code for our products. We decided to provide that tool that we've been using internally with over 1000 engineers for their own productivity free of charge. And so we've essentially handed our customers an internally trained tool that we found is 40% plus percent productivity improvement to help their own embedded control designers. And we continue to any enhancement that we make internally for our internal designers, we are now passing that on to our customers as well. And so we've gotten great feedback from customers that have started using it in terms of the productivity improvements, in terms of relating that to revenue, that is difficult to say at this point. Our goal is to make our customers life easier and to make the transition to Microchip development environment or using microchip as a whole easier. And also making customers tend to choose Microchip over someone else because of the ease of designing in a microchip product. That's the goal.
Craig Ellis: And is there anything about those tools, Rich, that would help them if they're going to use microchip in one product on a system board more easily designing microchip products for other parts of that system board so that the total system solution ambition that Microchip has had is something that's facilitated with the capability you've developed?
Richard Simoncic: Yes, so we have work going on. So we actually have AI product recommenders that actually do that now for customers. We've started unleashing that to them. But later in the year we will actually be offering board related support for TSS type solutions and so you can see where we're going. So now you've got product recommenders. Now you've got software development tools. Now you can start to combine product recommender with software development tools and you can start recommending block diagrams in putting that all together.
Craig Ellis: Thank you, Rich.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time and now I'd like to hand over to Mr. Sanghi for closing remarks. Thank you, sir.
Steve Sanghi: Well, thanks everyone for joining us. As you can see from our report that we have turned the corner and we're looking for significant improvement in our financial performance in this fiscal year. And we'll see many of you on the road as we go to the conferences this quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you very much for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2025 Q3  (2025-02-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. And welcome to the Microchip Technology Incorporated's Q3 Fiscal 2025 Financial Results call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce you to your host, Steve Sanghi, CEO. Thank you, Steve. You may begin.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, operator. And good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip Technology Incorporated's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Richard J. Simoncic, Eric Bjornholt, CFO, and Sajid Doty, Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on a restructuring and my observations since returning to Microchip Technology Incorporated as CEO. Eric will go over our third quarter fiscal year 2025 financial performance, and Richard will then review some product line updates. I will then provide an overview of the current business environment and our fourth quarter fiscal year 2025 guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Since I returned as Microchip Technology Incorporated CEO on November 18, 2024, I have spent a significant amount of time evaluating key aspects of Microchip Technology Incorporated's business. At the UBS conference on December 3, I described a nine-point plan to evaluate Microchip Technology Incorporated and make changes where needed to set the company on a course to achieve its previous premium status of performance. We are setting up an investor and analyst call on the morning of March 3 to provide you with a comprehensive update on that nine-point plan. Today, I'll give you an interim report on several aspects of that plan. The first action was to resize our manufacturing footprint. After analysis, we have decided to close our Tempe fab known as fab two. Currently, we are in the process of building the material to provide the buffer required before we transfer the processes and products to our other two fabs. Seventy percent of this product is already qualified at these other fabs. Our other two fabs, namely fab four in Gresham, Oregon, and fab five in Colorado Springs, are working on rotating time-off schedules. This reduces the capacity but leaves the fabs in a position to ramp capacity when needed on very short notice. In our back-end facilities in Thailand and the Philippines, we are managing capacity by taking shutdown days and reducing the number of employee hours and days of work. In the rest of our smaller plants worldwide, there is a plan for each plant based on the specific demand in each plant. Some of them are running at capacity, while others are working shortened weeks. The second action was to reduce our inventory. Our inventory at the end of December 2024 was 266 days, up from 247 days at the end of September 2024. Our target inventory is 130 to 150 days. On March 3, I will project out for you the inventory reduction plan. As an example, from December 2024 to the end of fiscal year 2026, which is March 31, 2026, we are currently expected to be able to reduce our inventory balance by approximately $250 million, which will liberate cash from this inventory reduction. The third action was a review of our megatrends and TSS and recommend any changes. I will provide an update on this topic on March 3. The fourth action was business unit by business unit deep dive. This is still underway, but I already know that we will reorganize some of our business units for greater efficiency and synergy. In the process, we will combine a few groups together. The fifth action was a review of Microchip Technology Incorporated's channel strategy. I have reviewed our channel strategy, and we have made two changes. First, when we give a demand creation registration to a distributor on a design socket, we historically have kept the demand creation flag forever. Going forward, we will change that flag to demand fulfillment after a given number of years. This will incentivize the distributor to present our new products to customers instead of sitting on a higher margin and exposing the socket to competitors. The second change is we had been providing industry-high fulfillment margins for distributors. We have lowered the fulfillment margins, which will bring it to a level that is still on the higher end of what our competitors provide. The sixth point of evaluation was to strengthen our customer relationships. We have targeted the top 1,000 customers with an urgent focus on the 256 customers. Many of them have already been approached and visited, or the customers visited us. We are giving customers the chance to communicate candidly with us, showing empathy and care, and then engaging with them to support them on their new designs. Our goal is to put our customers first and win their hearts and design opportunities with our products, technologies, support, and care. Points seven and eight were our long-term business model and operating expenses. I will provide an update on these topics on March 3. The ninth and final area was the chipset activity. We are currently paused, waiting for the new administration to restaff the Chip's office. We will then reengage when the time is right. With that, I will pass it to Eric Bjornholt. Eric?
Eric Bjornholt: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We've also posted a summary of our outstanding debt on our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation, and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliations on our website. Net sales in the December quarter were $1.026 billion. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 55.4%, including capacity underutilization charges of $42.7 million as we are aggressively managing production activities to adjust to challenging business conditions. Operating expenses were at 34.9% of net sales, and operating margin was 20.5%. Non-GAAP net income was $107.3 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.20. Please note that our operating expenses increased in the December quarter and will further increase in the March quarter due to a predominant portion of our employees coming off the pay cut that we had set on for about nine months in the late November, early December 2024 time frame. The full quarterly impact of this is reflected in our operating expense guidance for the March quarter. On a GAAP basis in the December quarter, gross margins were 54.7%. Total operating expenses were $530.5 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $122.6 million, special charges of $3.5 million, share-based compensation of $42 million, and $4.3 million of other expenses. The GAAP net loss was $53.6 million, resulting in a loss per share of $0.10. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 19.9% in the December quarter. We currently expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate to be approximately 14.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, which is modestly higher than our previously forecasted 13% tax rate. This is a result of expected overpayments in two of our larger tax jurisdictions, which will have the impact of reducing our fiscal year 2026 tax rate as we are calculating this on a cash basis. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. Our inventory balance at December 31, 2024, was $1.356 billion, which was up $16.7 million. We had 266 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, which was up 19 days from the prior quarter's level. At the midpoint of our March 2025 quarterly guidance, we would expect both inventory dollars and inventory days to decrease from the December 31, 2024 levels. We also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end-of-life by our supply chain partners, and these last-time buys represented 18 days of inventory at the end of December. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter was at 37 days and was down three days from the prior quarter's level. Distribution took down their inventory holdings in the December quarter, as distribution sell-through was $118 million higher than distribution sell-in. Our cash flow from operating activities was $271.5 million in the December quarter. Our adjusted free cash flow was $244.6 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $586 million, which is higher than normal due to the timing of the maturity dates of some of our commercial paper that did not occur until early January, which was used to pay down debt after the end of the December quarter. We retired $665.5 million in convertible bonds that matured in November 2024. In the December quarter, we also issued $1 billion in investment-grade bonds with a 4.9% coupon, maturing in March of 2028, and $1 billion in investment-grade bonds with a 5.05% coupon, maturing in February 2030. We used the proceeds of these bond offerings to retire our two $750 million term loans and pay down a portion of our commercial paper balance. Our next debt maturity is a $1.2 billion bond maturing in September 2025. The debt issuance this past quarter will give us ample room to retire our 2025 bond with our line of credit or commercial paper programs. As a result, we have taken the refinancing risk off the table for the $1.2 billion. Our net debt increased by $33.6 million in the December quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was $274.9 million and 26.8% of net sales. Our trailing twelve-month adjusted EBITDA was $1.64 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.78 at December 31, 2024, up from 1.27 at December 31, 2023. Capital expenditures were $18.1 million in the December quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year '25 is about $135 million, and we expect fiscal year 2026 capital expenditures to be lower than that as we have a lot of capacity to grow back into as well as capital that we purchased during the upcycle that has not been placed in service yet. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $40.4 million. I will now turn it over to Richard J. Simoncic, who will provide some commentary on our product line innovations in the December quarter. Rich?
Richard J. Simoncic: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our strategic investments continue to strengthen our position across key growth markets. In our core microcontroller business, we introduced a new generation of 64-bit RISC-V processors featuring advanced AI capabilities, integrated time-sensitive networking, and next-generation security. These processors deliver exceptional reliability for factory automation and secure data processing applications, particularly where real-time communication is critical. Initial customer response has been strong, with promising design win momentum across industrial, aerospace, and defense sectors. We expanded our Wi-Fi portfolio with 20 new products, expanding microcontrollers and plug-and-play modules, helping customers simplify robust, secure wireless connectivity and accelerate time to market. We also introduced a new Smart Touch controller with an industry-standard interface, making it simpler for manufacturing to implement water-tolerant touch solutions in their products. For high-speed wired connectivity, we continue strengthening our automotive networking portfolio with ASA Motion Link technology, enabling next-generation software-defined vehicles with high-speed data exchange between systems. Our innovative technology is currently being evaluated by several leading global automotive manufacturers. Our FPGA portfolio achieved two notable milestones. We earned the highest level of space certification for our radiation-hardened chips, strengthening our position in critical space missions, and released a new sensor connectivity solution for NVIDIA's Holoscan platform, enabling AI applications in medical imaging and industrial automation. These developments reinforce our commitment to providing comprehensive solutions across our target markets while making it easier for the next generation of products. Demonstrating our ability to simplify advanced technological implementation for our customers. With that, I will pass the call to Steve for comments about our business and guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Rich. As Eric described in his prepared remarks, our December quarter net sales were $1.026 billion, down 11.8% sequentially and down 41.9% from a year-ago quarter. As we continue to navigate through a very large inventory correction following a post-COVID super cycle, we saw continued broad-based weakness in the December quarter. Our revenue from our microcontroller, analog, FPGA, and other businesses were all down sequentially. Geographically, our business was down sequentially in all major geographies of America, Europe, and Asia. Now let's get into our guidance for the March quarter. We believe substantial inventory destocking has occurred at our customers, channel partners, and their downstream customers. Everyone would like me to call the last quarter the bottom. However, in our view, the inventory at our customers, channel partners, and their downstream customers has not fully corrected yet. Our bookings remain low, although the current quarter bookings are running at a higher rate than in the December quarter. Our backlog started out lower for the March quarter than it was at the start of the December quarter, so we have a lot of turns to take for the March quarter, and the visibility remains low. Taking all these factors into account, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be between $920 million and $1 billion. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 54% and 55% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 37.7% and 40.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 11.5% and 16.3% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.05 and $0.15. We are laser-focused on our nine-point plan. The megatrends and customer portion of that plan entails aggressively winning designs at the customers and then pulling them through the funnel to generate growth. We believe that as the remaining excess inventory is consumed at our customers and distributors, we are well-positioned to provide above-market growth in our net sales. Now let me provide an update on our capital return program for shareholders. We are essentially returning 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to investors in the form of dividends right now. Due to depressed net sales, our adjusted free cash flow is currently less than our dividend, and in certain quarters, we have had to make higher bond interest payments and tax payments. Bond interest payments are made every six months, so every other quarter, this impacts our adjusted free cash flow and results in our dividend exceeding our adjusted free cash flow. As we begin to liberate cash from our inventory, coupled with very low capital expenditures, we expect to bring the free cash flow above the dividend in future quarters. We intend to use the excess cash to bring our borrowings back down to at least the levels they were at before our dividend exceeded our adjusted free cash flow. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. It may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I appreciate your comments, and I realize visibility is limited, but you mentioned inventory remains elevated at customers and channel partners. Could you share with us, you know, where the hotspots are by end market or by the kind of product? Is it, like, worse in industrial or microcontrollers, etc.? And do you think that this is the inventory issue specific to Microchip Technology Incorporated, or do you think those customers and channel partners have kind of, you know, excess inventory from your competitors also because many of them seem to be indicating a lower level of concern than you were?
Steve Sanghi: So I think the answer to your first part of your question, which is, you know, by end markets or, you know, by product line, the inventory is high pretty much across the board. And it's not different by end markets. What it is different is slightly by direct or distribution. Our distribution customers' inventory is getting a lot closer to where they historically would be. And if you know, just in the quarter past, our sell-in revenue was $118 million lower than our sell-through revenue. On GAAP, we report on sell-in, but distribution sold out $118 million more. And they've been doing this kind of number for the last few quarters. So the distribution inventory is getting a lot closer to getting corrected. But the direct inventory of customers is still high. And part of that reason is, you know, when the supply was really tight, you know, we were serving our large direct customers sometimes preferentially over the broad-based distribution customers. So, you know, and the number two reason for our customers having higher inventory is that we dismantled our non-cancellable program called PSP two quarters or so later than our competitors did. So therefore, we continued to ship for two more quarters. And when the business had eventually fell, at our customers, they had higher inventory of our products than potentially our competitors. Hopefully, that answers your question.
Vivek Arya: Even just as a follow-up, what would you say the earnings power for Microchip Technology Incorporated over the next year? You know, in fiscal, in this last fiscal year, you know, with the March guidance, it's about a dollar, you know, dollar thirty-ish or so. So even if we start assuming some level of seasonal rebound or, you know, at some point over the next several quarters, you know, should we be thinking two dollars, three dollars? What is the kind of earnings power, right, in the medium term for the company? Because I imagine you are justifiably prioritizing cash flow and, you know, you'll probably keep fab utilization low. And then the need to get OpEx back to a reasonable level, right, would also influence. How do you think about earnings power for the company over the next, you know, year to two years or so? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Well, I mean, you know, you're right on all that, but putting numbers around it, I don't really have it. We don't guide that far out. I'll pass it on to Eric and see if he has something to add.
Eric Bjornholt: Well, you know, Steve's right. You know, we guide a quarter at a time. We are working through Steve's nine-point plan, and, you know, obviously, he talked a lot about what we're doing in manufacturing, OpEx, and the long-term business model. That is still to be set, and we've got some more work to do on that, and we'll share more details with the analyst and investor community on March 3. So it's hard to answer that question, I think, as you knew when you asked it. And we think we are positioned, as Steve's prepared remarks said, for above-market growth, but, you know, we need to get through this inventory correction to start seeing the benefits of that. And we've got a lot of confidence in our long-term business and what it can drive from an operating margin perspective and cash flow perspective. But we're not quite out of this yet.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Blayne Curtis: Hey. Good afternoon. Two questions. I just want to ask. I know you don't want to forecast revenue slow back, but maybe can you walk us through the gross margin a bit? Because I think it stepped down more. Obviously, you said days and dollars would come down in inventory, but is there some level that you want to get to to give us some references on how long this may be depressed before it comes back with revenue?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think, you know, on March 3, we'll give you some data on inventory depletion and rightsizing our factory, with which you may be able to model, you know, the question you asked and the question with Vivek asked. We don't really have it today, but I would like to highlight is, you know, even for the, you know, current quarter, we're guiding a gross margin of midpoint of 53%. So many of our competitors don't do that in good times. You know, so that's extremely good gross margin. No. Operating expense, at about 39.1%, which is the midpoint of what we guided today, it was quite high compared to our historical, and that's driven by really, you know, adding a lot of people at the top of the cycle when the assumption was the business just keeps going. So we have a correction there to do, and I'll be able to talk to you more about it again on March 3. And the gross margin of 53% is with very, very low factory utilization that we're running today. And you know where the gross margins historically have been? There's actually no reason why gross margins do not return to historical numbers. Not a historical high, which was really at the peak of the cycle and, you know, had expedite charges and price increases and all that in. But leaving that time frame out, we should be able to get to our historical gross margins. And with correcting the operating expenses, you should have really a beautiful P&L, which I'll give it to you as a long-term target on March 3.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks. And then wanted to ask you on the growth side. That's always been a debate for the company. I'm just kind of curious about your renewed perspective here coming back. You mentioned some moves with the distribution channel to kind of incentivize demand creation. Do you think when you said the company can outgrow the market, is that going to be a work in progress, or do you think that's what it is today and these moves would kind of add the...
Steve Sanghi: I don't know if I can separate those two. I think, you know, I'll make a trend. Design wins are, you know, higher than a non-mega trend design win. I think we have shared some data in the past with you. They're about that's the normal. So we also went through an environment during the super cycle of COVID where all customers' engineers were doing is trying to find alternate parts or really fit whatever product we had available for them into their design and requalifying them. So kind of not much new design happened for a couple of years. Our customers are reengaged doing new designs. They are in, you know, various parts of the funnel. And when they go to production, you know, that really model will show that our business grows from that. And then the other thing is the inventory depletion both at the customers and channels. And when that inventory depletes, then customers start buying their full consumption rate, then that will increase the revenue. Combine those two together, we don't really have any concerns about the long-term future. It's just we gotta, you know, get through this. I think we're getting close. You know, but the industry has been saying, getting close for about a year. So I don't want to really spell out any quarter to be the bottom. But, you know, we already be getting quite close.
Blayne Curtis: Gotcha. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.
Harsh Kumar: Yeah. Hey, Steve. Good to see you back. I had a quick question on OpEx. Sounds like from the answer you just gave to Blayne, I think you said that OpEx will come down from the current level in absolute dollars. Is that a fair assumption? That's my clarification question. And then on the nine-point program that you have, are you assuming that things, the environment will stay the same, or are you baking in some level of recovery at some point in time this year or next year? It's gotta come back at some point in time, but I'm curious if you're baking that in your assumption or keeping the environment the same.
Steve Sanghi: We are baking it in our assumption. The growth will be a result of some return of business when the inventory is depleted plus our efforts into winning new designs. With all the new products we have introduced in the last three, four years, many of them, many customers are sitting on significant designs, but they didn't complete them or launch them in an environment when they had a lot of inventory.
Harsh Kumar: Understood. I had another question. Maybe not so easy, but could you take me through the process of how your organization would even try to gauge the correct level of channel inventory or direct inventory in this kind of an environment where things are dynamic, they're moving around, mostly going down, but still moving around a lot? I'm more curious about the process to understand how you would try to get to the right answer here.
Steve Sanghi: So I think historically, over twenty, twenty-five years, you know, our channels on the average worldwide will have an inventory which is about two and a half to two point seven times, you know, what they ship out to their customers in a given quarter. And it kind of really stayed in that window, two and a half to three. They've been very few occasions when the inventory was much higher than that, what happened soon after the Microsemi acquisition? When we consolidated the numbers, Microsemi inventory was, you know, closer to four, and ours was lower. And then that we aggressively brought it down. So it can change, but in general, it isn't that. And we see no reason why distributor inventory, you know, would come back down to below three.
Harsh Kumar: Understood. Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: And I think when you're saying that, Steve, you mentioned two and a half times what they ship in a quarter. It's really two and a half to three months of inventory based on what they're shipping out.
Steve Sanghi: After three months. Sorry.
Eric Bjornholt: That's alright. Understood. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Teamwork.
Operator: Thank you. As a reminder, next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Steve, it sounds like you've been spending quite a bit of time with customers over the past two months since your return. I'm curious, what the feedback has been to you and the company, any common threads, and how do you plan on responding to some of the customer asks going forward? What do you need to do to regain any lost trust, if you will?
Steve Sanghi: So I'm gonna hand that question to Richard J. Simoncic. He has talked to more customers than I have. I've been not spending a lot of time on the business units and the factories and customers also when they come to us, but I may add something, but let him give the basic answer. Go ahead.
Richard J. Simoncic: So we've been spending a lot of time in front of customers, and, you know, mainly what customers are dealing with today is trying to digest the inventory that they have. In dealing with the weaker markets, we've been spending time with our distributors, our catalog houses. And our customer relationships are in pretty good shape. Where we're losing or not losing, but where we have some tough customer relationships, where they're sitting on quite a bit of inventory, you know, from a PSP program or upset about some of the price increases that took place during the COVID period.
Toshiya Hari: Fine.
Richard J. Simoncic: No. I think a lot of customers suffered from that from other semiconductor suppliers. So what we're trying to do is work with them, you know, understand where they're upset on some of those customers, and then see what we can do going forward. Don't think there's anything magic here other than us working together to find a good win-win going forward. I think as we went through the customer relationships, we found, you know, twice as many that were happier with us, that our relationship improved. And then we had some that, you know, our relationship had degraded. And where we have those that degraded and our worst accounts where they had degraded was those 256 that Steve highlighted. And, you know, out of the abundance of customers we have, we're gonna work on those 256 where we've degraded that relationship.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you. No customer is telling us, you know, go away. You had a horrible anything like that. I think our products are good. Our tools are good. Our service and support has been world-class over the years. And many of these customers, we have a multi-decade relationship. So it's kind of just, you know, they got hurt. Some of them got hurt during the super cycle one way or the other, either with pricing or not getting enough product or getting too much product and have inventory. And just hurt feelings have to be soothed, and time heals, and discussion and talk heals, and we're largely getting those customers back designing the...
Toshiya Hari: Great. Thank you. And then as a quick follow-up, maybe on pricing, calendar 2024, where did blended ASPs for you all land roughly? And how should we think about 2025 and sort of the forward path? I think many of your peers have said something along the lines of, you know, that they expect pricing to revert to pre-pandemic patterns, which is down low single digits. You know, are you thinking about pricing the same way, or could it be, you know, a little bit different for you guys? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: So, you know, my sense is that short term, yes, what the competitors are doing is correct. But I'm not sure it returns to a price drop every year because pre-pandemic, Microchip Technology Incorporated wasn't giving a year-over-year price decrease. Our costs don't go down year over year. You know, many of the costs go up, and through, you know, through efficiency gains and yield improvements and others, you gotta get back to your margin. So, you know, the price drops, you know, every year was really a thing of the past. But short term, I think, you know, we increased prices quite a bit over the past three, four years. And some price reduction in the low to mid-single digits near term is appropriate.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.
Vijay Rakesh: Hi. Thanks for asking. And just a quick question. I think you're looking at the different segments, autos, industrial, consumer. Is there a way to let's work this playlist and how they're done year on year?
Eric Bjornholt: We break out our end markets once a year, Vijay. We do that at the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March. So we'll provide more color on that probably in the kind of early May time frame when we release our year-end earnings. So don't have it to share today. You know, really, all end markets have been weak. We've highlighted a few things that have been stronger over this period of time. And not a whole lot of change there. Right? But overall, you know, industrial automotive has been weak. That's consistent with what you're hearing from everybody else.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And then on the inventory side, is there any risk for inventory obsolescence or write-down given, you know, you're seeing some disintermediation with other solutions, I guess. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: So, you know, we have been taking pretty significant inventory reserve charges, and so those have been reflected in the gross margin and our expectation for gross margin this quarter. We've got a lot of inventory sitting on the balance sheet, and revenue has been falling, and backlog's been falling. So with low visibility and lower revenue and a high level of inventory, that's just the place we're in right now. Steve's talked about the actions that we're taking to reduce inventory in dollars and days, and I think we've got a good plan in place to do that. And so as we move forward, not saying necessarily this quarter is there, our gross margin guidance is down. But as we move forward, those charges should reduce as the inventory balance comes down, and hopefully, we see a better revenue environment.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. Please proceed.
Chris Danely: Thanks, guys. I guess question for Steve/Rich. You know, Steve, has you been there for three months now? Is there anything you see that's gone wrong that is not fixable? And then if you/Rich could just spend some time on your assessment of Microchip Technology Incorporated's competitive positioning and how you feel that that is, let's say, versus, you know, a couple of years ago. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: Oh, I haven't found anything that is not fixable. I think, you know, rightsizing the factory is fixable, and we're in the process of doing so. The high inventory is fixable, and we're in the process of doing so. As we're doing these various business unit reviews, you know, some business units have flourished. Some of the others have underperformed. And we need to move some things around to put our resources, take them away from lower-performing business units, and put them in the high-performing business units. Some optimization needs to be done. So that is fixable. You know, we compete in a lot of different businesses, microcontrollers, analog, data center, automotive, aerospace and defense, and all that. And in any business unit or any end market, you'll find, you know, that we should have this product or this feature. We don't have it yet. Somebody else has it. And internal discussion would be how we can plug that gap. But at the same time, you know, we have products with some differentiating features that our competitors don't. But, no, I haven't found anything that is not fixable. But anytime you find a product hole, it does take, you know, two years of development to plug that hole. I think, but in general, I haven't really found anywhere, no, any major problem that is not fixable, but it takes time to fix some of these things.
Chris Danely: Okay. And the competitive positioning question? And then I'll go away.
Steve Sanghi: Rich, you wanna answer that?
Richard J. Simoncic: Yeah. You know what? I think in our analysis of that, in our surveys of that, in our discussion with our distributors, the feedback we're getting, we're predominantly holding our own in that competitive positioning. You know, it's still we're still working through it. I think with what's confusing right now because of inventory, you lose visibility in terms of where some of those customers are when you have a large swath of customers. Microchip Technology Incorporated has about 120,000 customers. So, obviously, we can't touch 120,000. But we're touching all of the, see, the focus ones and dedicated ones that we have. And the relationships are still strong. And we have customers that are still coming through and working with us. So I don't see anything majorly broken on that customer front. We work on relationships, but there's nothing fundamentally broken. Alright. Like I said earlier, I think most customers were just unhappy about how the whole COVID period went and how they built up inventory. You know, we did find, which was, you know, quite fascinating, that our smaller customers, medium and smaller customers, when material was finally available to them, you know, instead of buying one year or twelve months, they may have bought twenty-four months. So, you know, they bought a little bit extra on the smaller and medium customers. And so it really varies depending on the market and the customer base.
Chris Danely: Got it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. Of the 266 days of inventory, can you talk about how much of that is from the internal fabs? I think you had given a number that it's over 300 in the past, and then I had a follow-up on that.
Steve Sanghi: So I think internal fabs were 288 or something. Eric, you have the breakdown?
Eric Bjornholt: It's in that range. I'd have to pull up a spreadsheet to look at it. It's in that range. The internal fabs are higher than what it is on the foundry and system side of the business.
Joe Moore: Okay. And then you talked about taking an inventory kind of reserve around the lower utilization. Like, are we that 53%, does that fully reflect the lower utilization, or is there kind of a lingering cost of inventory that's higher because of that lower utilization going forward?
Eric Bjornholt: Well, you know, when you're running the factories less efficiently, you are capitalizing costs and inventory at higher levels even though you're taking these underutilization charges. So, you know, it takes some time to build to work through that higher cost inventory. But, you know, I would expect to see gross margin improvement before that because, you know, these inventory reserve charges will go down. Right? We've taken a lot of reserve charges at some point. We will get sell-through benefits from that also. So hard to predict exactly how that will weigh, and we'll probably just give, you know, quarterly guidance, and we'll give a long-term target. But, you know, we are, you know, reflecting the gross margin you see today, you know, the unusual base in charges, and as the factories build that up back up, those charges will go down. And, you know, obviously, we're taking out our third-largest factory in fab two that's going to help us get inventory corrected faster than if we had not taken that step.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you so much.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed.
Jeremy: Yes. Good afternoon. This is Jeremy calling for Tore. I guess, maybe going back to the question. Can you just help us quantify or size a little bit the turns that you might need to get the midpoint and, you know, how that compares versus historical cycles and at different points in the cycle historically? Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: No. I didn't get that. I've got it. So the question is, I'll repeat it real quickly. Is, you know, what and when we're looking at the current quarter to get to the midpoint, how do the turns look compared to what we've seen historically? And so I'll give an answer to that, and Rich and Steve can add to it if they want to. So, you know, when lead times are very short, which they are today, our business has historically been able to respond to a high level of turns, and it's just a matter of is the customer demand there to fill that in? We've given guidance based on what we think is reasonable for the quarter and obviously given a range of guidance, and the turns required to meet that are not outside of what would be normal in a short lead time environment.
Jeremy: Very helpful. Yeah. And I mean, very...
Richard J. Simoncic: Maybe just add one more piece. So it says turns and then as expedites and pull-ins, and we're continuing to see expedite and pull-ins come in as well.
Eric Bjornholt: Right. And what a pull-in is would be is we already have backlog in place that sits outside of the quarter. And then the customer comes to us and says, hey, instead of needing that product in April, now I need it in March, can you support that? And that's what Rich means by a pull-in.
Jeremy: That's very helpful. Thank you. And maybe a quick question on the new product side. Can you give us, you know, on the RISC-V processor, can you help us maybe find the opportunity here both in the near term and the long term? Maybe in the near term when we could see initial revenue contribution, and in the longer term, you know, what it will take for this to potentially scale as you look out three to five years?
Richard J. Simoncic: Yeah. So what we haven't forecasted the overall revenue impact to Microchip Technology Incorporated. What we're seeing is a great many customers building development environments and asking for help with software on. And so we've seen customers now start to build out development groups and design groups around this platform of products and starting to design them into different applications. And so we haven't announced any of those design wins yet, but the level of activity is quite high.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed.
Craig Ellis: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. And, Tim, thanks for all the color so far. Steve, I wanted to go back to the plan's first point on production and ask a more qualitative question. Can you help us understand where the team is in assessing the right level of front-end and back-end capacity and where you are in terms of identifying the specific steps that are needed to realign that capacity and the things that allow you to be operating at the new correct capacity that you determined?
Steve Sanghi: The team is very far along. Identifying what steps need to be taken to right-size the other factories beyond closing down fab two. And we'll be disclosing that to you on March 3.
Craig Ellis: Got it. And then, Eric, I'll just follow up on the point you made on the debt maturity in September. It sounds like you're well-positioned to deal with that. Is it correct that the next maturity beyond that would be in March of 2028? And if not, can you help me understand when that would be?
Eric Bjornholt: Yeah. Eric is trying to look at his computer. Yeah. I'm just pulling it up to make sure I don't misspeak to it. So we do have another tranche of $1 billion due in March of 2028. The $1.2 billion we talked about, we'll have to redo our line of credit at some point in time. That's a pretty standard process that we go through. But that's how the tranches are weighing out right now. The $1.2 billion in September of 2025 is the next one. And then after that, it's not till 2028.
Craig Ellis: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. I guess the first question with regard to the dividend, and, you know, I know at this point, you're not, you know, fully generating free cash flow to support the dividend. Could you talk about your level of commitment to that dividend and as we're going through, you know, sort of the recovery plan and such that, you know, we're still committed to this dividend in the foreseeable future as free cash flow starts to get better?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. So as you may have noticed, we did not increase the dividend by a submission that we have been doing it probably for years and years. So there's no reason to add to it. And we'll keep this dividend flat, but there is no reason to take it down. Not generating enough cash flow is a very short-term problem. And it kind of raises its ugly head every six months, you know, because every six months, bond payments are due. And in one quarter, you know, they're not there. And the other quarter, the dividend payment, yeah. I'm sorry. The bond payment pops up. So every other quarter, we have to borrow some money to pay the dividend, but I think this problem should really go away in the coming quarters pretty rapidly. So because it's a short-term issue, there's no reason to do long-term damage by cutting that dividend.
Eric Bjornholt: Yeah. Maybe just as an example, our adjusted free cash flow in the December quarter is essentially equal to what our dividend payment is in March. But our adjusted free cash flow will be lower in the March quarter and then won't cover what we would pay in the June quarter. And we always have based our capital return program based on the prior quarter's free cash flow. So anyway, right now, it's obviously not as high as we would like it to be, but confidence in the business getting back to the higher levels and profitability returning, as well as the working capital management we're doing with the inventory reduction, is going to help us with that.
Chris Caso: Understood. For a second question, it's about kind of manufacturing capacity. And I know you're going to provide some more details in March. But, you know, I guess two parts to that. One would be, you know, internally, you don't have access to 300-millimeter manufacturing, and, you know, it doesn't sound like that's something that you're going to pursue. Do you feel that the internal fab network is still competitive with the rest of the market as you see some others, you know, start to expand on 300-millimeter? You know, how does Microchip Technology Incorporated respond to that? And then secondly, you've seen some other competitors move to a China-for-China manufacturing strategy because of some of the geopolitical tensions, the feeling that Chinese customers want a manufacturing footprint inside of China. How is Microchip Technology Incorporated responding to that?
Steve Sanghi: So let me check those. The first one on 300-millimeter, we use a substantial 300-millimeter capacity at a foundry. So a fair amount of our business today in various business units is on 300. It's just not internal. It is external. And I will tell you that, you know, many of our competitors who make 300-millimeter with all the underutilization, all that cost to rent it, and, you know, the time it takes to develop the technology. When you look at the total cost of ownership, I think their experience in total cost of ownership is really no better than, you know, us buying a very well-known running technology with high yields, you know, at the professional foundry. So I think we're pretty happy with that. There was a point two, three years ago when foundries were telling us they wouldn't be adding more trailing-edge capacity. And all the investments were going to go into the advanced technology. So at that point, we were concerned about whether there'll be enough capacity for 300-millimeter for 90-nanometer, 65-nanometer, and 40. Specifically, those three technologies. And at that time, we then we were pursuing building a fab in the US and getting some money from ChipSact to do so. And as we were engaging with the government and all that to do that, you know, the business is slow. And our foundry business is slow. Now today, you can buy as much 40-nanometer, 65-nanometer, and 90, you know, as you want. And then the factories told us that this will be no longer a problem. And in fact, some of them are investing in additional 40, 65, and 90 for the future. So, therefore, you know, for us to spend multibillion dollars, probably a five to six billion dollar investment to build a 300-millimeter factory, you know, which will take a decade plus to fill it. And you'll have no utilization in the beginning, I think that cost of ownership equation just does not work. And the second part of your question was on China-for-China strategy. We have a China-for-China strategy also. And I'll talk about that also on March 3.
Chris Caso: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to pass the call back over to Steve for any closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: I want to thank all the investors and analysts who attended the call, and thanks for your support over many, many years when I was the CEO, and I've just gotten back, and, you know, things are going to improve rapidly. So please be patient, and I thank you for your support.
Operator: Right. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2025 Q2  (2024-11-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Microchip’s Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Eric Bjornholt, CFO. Thank you. You may begin.
Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip’s President and CEO; Rich Simoncic, Microchip’s COO; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip’s Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2025 financial performance. Rich will then review some product line updates and Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and cash return strategy as well as an overview of our current business environment. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliation on our website. Net sales in the September quarter were $1.164 billion which was down 6.2% sequentially. We recently settled an ongoing legal matter with one of our licensees. The impact of this settlement was the release of a $13.3 million accrual, which increased revenue and gross profit by $13.3 million in the September 2024 quarter. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were just above the midpoint of our guidance of 59.5% including capacity underutilization charges of $25.9 million as we continue to manage production activities to adjust the challenging business conditions. Without the benefit of the legal settlement mentioned earlier, the non-GAAP gross margins would have been 59.1%. Operating expenses were at 30.3% of net sales and operating margin was 29.3%. Non-GAAP net income was $250.2 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.46 which was $0.03 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance and positively impacted by $0.02 from the aforementioned legal settlement. On a GAAP basis in the September quarter, gross margins were 57.4%. As you may recall on August 20, we announced that a cybersecurity incident had impacted our business operations and on September 4, we announced that this incident was unlikely to materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. During the close process for the September quarter, we evaluated the financial impact of the breach including unscheduled factory outages and although the incident did not materially impact our financial condition or results of operations, we determined that the total cost impact of the incident was approximately $21.4 million. The majority of this cost is attributed to incremental factory underutilization charges resulting from a cybersecurity incident. Total operating expenses were $521.9 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $122.7 million, special charges of $1.5 million, share-based compensation of $42 million and $3.6 million of other expenses. GAAP net income was $78.4 million resulting in $0.14 in earnings per diluted share. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 13% in the September quarter, which was in-line with our guidance. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2025 is expected to be about 13%, which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis points favorable adjustment to Microchip’s non-GAAP tax rate in future periods. Our inventory balance at September 30, 2024 was $1.34 billion which was up $31.6 million from the end of the June 2024 quarter. We had 247 days of inventory at the end of the September quarter, which was up 10 days from the prior quarter’s level. At the midpoint of our December 2024 quarter guidance, we would expect both inventory dollars and days to increase. We also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived high margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners and these last time buys represented 18 days of inventory at the end of the September quarter. Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter was at 40 days, which was down three days from the prior quarter’s level. Distribution took their inventory holdings in the September quarter down as distribution sell-through was about $95 million higher than distribution sell-in. Our cash flow from operating activities was $43.6 million in the September quarter and was negatively impacted by the timing of interest and tax payments, including the transition tax payment that is paid annually and was part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We have one more transition tax payment that is due in the September quarter of 2025. Hence, our adjusted free cash flow was $14 million in the September quarter. As of September 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $286.1 million. Our total debt increased by $256 million in the September quarter and was negatively impacted by the higher tax and interest payments than the previous quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA in the September quarter was $405.7 million, 34.9% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $2.161 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.85 at September 30, 2024 up from 1.28 at September 30, 2023. Capital expenditures were $20.8 million in the September quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2025 is about $150 million and we expect fiscal year 2026 capital expenditures to be lower than that as we have a lot of capacity to grow back into as well as capital that we purchased during the up cycle that has not yet been placed in service. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $41.2 million. I will now turn it over to Rich, who will provide some commentary on our product line performance and innovations in the September quarter. Rich?
Richard J. Simoncic: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. We are strategically investing in and launching innovative technologies across high growth sectors. We believe these advancements are positioning us to capture emerging opportunities and drive long-term value creation. In the Microcontroller space, our new dsPIC33A Digital Signal Controller core, with its 32 bit architecture and double precision floating point unit, is driving innovation in critical sectors. In industrial automation, it’s enabling more precise, energy efficient motor control for smart factories and renewable energy systems, powering advanced grid inverters and solar installations as well as power supplies for GPU and CPU based data centers. We believe this positions us strongly in a growing clean energy market as evidenced by recently released Electric Vehicle Charger Reference Designs. We have further expanded our MPU offerings with our PIC64GX multicore 64 bit microprocessors, targeting secure intelligent edge systems that require multiple applications to run simultaneously on a single platform. Similarly, our new PIC64 high-performance space computer radiation hardened MPU, complete with built-in AI accelerators and advanced Ethernet connectivity, represents a significant step forward for the compute needs of space exploration and satellite deployment. For high-performance space computers, we are sole sourced in aerospace and defense applications for this compute function and working with numerous customers on early development of applications. In our data center and networking business, we are focused on evolving data center needs. Our family of PCIe switches and high-performance PCIe SSD controllers are now in mass production and widely adopted by customers. These product families are designed and optimized to meet the high-speed connectivity and high-performance storage needs of standard and AI accelerated servers. We’re also seeing increased end customer qualification activity with our CXL controller solutions, which will enable larger server memory footprints and improve the efficiency of data center servers. We believe these solutions position us well to address the evolving needs of next generation data centers. In the automotive sector, we are expanding our Single-Pair Ethernet portfolio with our new 1000BASE-T1 PHYs supporting extended cable links. Additionally, we are excited about the launch of our VelocityDRIVE software platform and automotive qualified multi-gigabit Ethernet switches, which are now available to support the next generation of software defined vehicles and industrial applications. These innovations underscore our commitment to providing cutting-edge solutions across renewable energy, automotive, aerospace, defense and data center sectors. We are making it easier for our customers to build smarter, more efficient products, laying the groundwork for future growth in these dynamic marketplaces. With that, I will pass the call to Ganesh, for comments about our business and guidance going forward. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. As Eric described in his prepared remarks, our September quarter results benefited from the settlement of legal matter with one of our licensees. Including this benefit, our net sales were down 6.2% sequentially and our non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted EPS were all better than the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding the benefit of the legal settlement, our September quarter results were consistent with our guidance with net sales down 7.3% sequentially as we continue to navigate through an inventory correction that’s occurring in the midst of significant macro weakness from any manufacturing businesses, especially those in the industrial end market. Excluding the legal settlement benefit, non-GAAP gross margin came in just over the midpoint of our guidance at 59.1%, while non-GAAP operating margin came in at the midpoint of our guidance at 28.5% as we continue to manage our expenses by balancing the short-term realities and the long-term growth opportunities. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in a $0.01 ahead of guidance at $0.44 per share. My thanks to our worldwide team for their support, hard work and diligence as we continue to navigate a difficult environment and focus on controllable actions that we believe position us well to thrive in the long-term. Now, for some color about the September quarter and the general business environment. All regions of the world and most of our end markets are exhibited varying degrees of weakness. The exceptions were aerospace and defense and the artificial intelligence subset of data center. Our business in Europe, which is concentrated in the industrial and automotive markets, was particularly weak with revenue down almost 22% on a sequential basis. Our broad base of customers continue to manage their inventory tightly and adjust their purchasing plans in the face of a weak macro environment for manufacturing, high interest rates, inventory in their channels, very short lead time for our products and an uncertain business outlook. This combination of factors we believe is driving lower consumption and continued inventory destocking as well as reductions in target inventory levels at multiple levels at our direct customers, at contract manufacturers and distributors who buy from us, at our indirect customers who buy through our distributors and in many cases at our customers’ customers. The early signs of green shoots in our business we saw in the March and June quarters progressed at an uneven pace with bookings staying flattish on a quarterly basis, but continuing to age over shorter periods of time with an increasing number of requests for expedites of new orders as well as shipment date pull-ins for previously placed orders and with cancellations and push-outs declining to normal levels. We believe these factors are positive signs for the formation of a bottom in our business despite low customer confidence in the macro environment and resultant low visibility for our business. Our average lead times continue to be about eight weeks or less, while the short lead times are resulting in reduced near-time visibility as customers delay placing orders since they have high confidence that supply is readily available. We also believe short lead times during a period of business uncertainty are helping customers navigate the uncertain environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed with us. We have adjusted our operational systems to adapt to this uncertain environment and pre-positioned semi-finished and finished goods inventory as best as we can to be able to accept and ship the turns orders we need for the December quarter. Our factories around the world are continuing to run at lower utilization rates in order to help control inventory levels. Our internal capacity expansion actions remain paused, and we expect our capital investments in fiscal year ‘25 as well in fiscal year ‘26 will be at or below the low-end of our long-term range of 3% to 6% of revenue as we plan to use the inventory we have invested in as well as our underutilized capacity to support the initial phases of the next up cycle. We are also prepared for the long-term growth of our business, on the one hand, in partnership with our foundry and outsourced assembly and test partners, and on the other hand, with the optionality of deploying capital, which we have purchased but not yet placed into service for our internal factories. While there remains uncertainty about the shape of the future recovery, we do expect it to arrive as it has in all prior semiconductor cycles, and we believe we are well prepared for the things we can control to exploit whatever the market recovery will look like. On the CHIPS Act front, we are making progress towards concluding a final agreement that is consistent with the goals of the CHIPS program and with our business values. And, we are cautiously optimistic that this could happen no later than the end of December. Now, let’s get into the guidance for the December quarter. While we believe substantial inventory destocking has occurred at our customers, channel partners and their downstream customers, we remain in an environment of continuing macro uncertainty for our customers and result in low visibility for us. Additionally, the December quarter has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter and it’s when there are the most manufacturing holidays, especially in Europe and the Americas. And, it is also the time of the year when customers tend to reduce inventory on the year ending balance sheet. In the current economic environment, many customers have also indicated that they intend to take an extended year-end shutdown. While we need turns orders and customer driven pull-ins within the quarter to meet our guidance and operating in a high-turns environment has historically been normal for Microchip, it is challenging to predict and plan for during abnormal times as we’re in today. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call into consideration, we expect our net sales for the December quarter to be between $1.025 billion and $1.095 billion. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57% and 59% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 33.2% and 34.8% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating profit to be between 22.2% 25.8% of sales. And, we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.25 and $0.35. We expect our long-term growth to be driven by a combination of our new product innovation as well as the strength of our design-in activity. Rich has already provided a summary of several of the new product innovation results. On the design-in front, after two plus years of dealing with shortages and redeploying their innovation resources towards mitigating the impact of shortages, our customers for the last year plus have returned to prioritizing their innovation projects. The result is a strong design-in pipeline across all end markets, megatrends and key customers, which is amplified by our total system solutions approach to take advantage of our broad portfolio of solutions. The impact of this growing design pipeline is muted in the current environment where excess inventory gets most of the attention and design-in activity takes time to gestate into production. But, design win momentum is what we expect will drive above market long-term growth. We believe the fundamental characteristics of growth, profitability and cash generation of our business remain intact, but is suppressed in the current business environment. We’re confident that our solutions remain the engine of innovation for the applications and end markets we serve. This down cycle we’re in has been the most prolonged and challenging down cycle I can recall during my 43 years in the industry. And, we believe it could set up a strong cycle reversal at some point in 2025 and we remain committed to executing our strategic imperatives which we believe will deliver sustain results and substantial shareholder value. Let me wrap up with an update about our capital return to shareholders. In the September quarter, we returned $261 million to shareholders through a combination of $243.7 million in dividends and $17.3 million in stock purchase in the open market. This represented 92.5% of our adjusted free cash flow in the June quarter. Since achieving investment grade rating in November 2021, we have returned $4.8 billion of capital to shareholders through the September 2024 quarter, of which $2.4 billion represented shares we purchased, which is about 5% of our shares outstanding. We are continuing towards our target of returning 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders for the March 2025 quarter, with the dividend being the fixed component and share buybacks being the variable component. We expect that due to the timing of cash payments, occasionally our adjusted free cash flow may dip below the fixed component represented by the dividend. In such situations, as you heard during Eric’s prepared remarks about the September quarter, we expect to temporarily increase our borrowings to pay the dividend and then repay those borrowings in subsequent quarters from the free cash flow generated that is in excess of the dividends paid. With this approach, we aim to stay consistent with our capital return strategy without causing it to increase our debt permanently. With that, Matt, would you please poll for questions?
Operator: Great. Thank you. At this time, we’ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question is from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Ganesh, I kind of wanted your perspective on how long you think it could take the distribution channel to sort of get back to normal. If I look at your drawdown in revenue, basically, it was all of distribution this quarter. So, it seems like things are actually relatively okay beyond that channel. So, if you kind of look at inventory days, it’s about 2x what it was before COVID. I mean, do you think that 20 days of inventory is still what that channel wants to hold? And, sort of given your discussions with them, how long do you think it could take to sort of clear that channel?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, maybe two points of data first. 20 days was towards the low-end of where we were during COVID. If you look at over time, closer to 30 plus or minus is where distribution days of inventory have been. Second, those days of inventory are calculated on a backward looking revenue basis. And, when you are in a steep decline and expecting to bottom and grow again, the backward looking days of inventory isn’t always the most helpful calculation, although it is the calculation that is consistent across quarters. Now that said, in this cycle, the distribution inventory is not just driven by what are they carrying, but sometimes their customers and their customers’ customers and their customers’ channels also have inventory that is destocking. And so, what we’re seeing is depending on which customer, what region, which distributor, there’s some of this where the distribution destocking is taking place, but what is less visible is destocking taking place at other places farther downstream that had all been collecting during the strong quarters as we were in 2023 and 2022 as well. So, it’s a bit more difficult to see. We know that distribution is destocking at the rate quite significantly over the last three quarters. But they have to get enough of a signal from their customers on that coming back. We do see some early signs of that, that their request for expedites, their request for pull-ins and all of that. But, it’s hard to read beyond that given how little visibility there is in the market.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. And then Eric, just a question on underutilization and how it could affect the shape of the gross margin recovery. The last quarter where you didn’t take charges, I think was the end of ‘23 when revenue was like 1.8 a quarter. And so, if your capacity hasn’t really changed since then, does revenue have to get all the way back to 1.8 before you’re no longer burdened by underutilization? Can you kind of talk through all that? Thanks.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. So, that kind of depends on what the slope of the revenue curve is and what our forecast is out in time when we get to that point in terms of how we’re going to be ramping. So, I can’t put a revenue number around it of where that’s going to be, but we’re significantly underutilized today. That’s going to continue obviously in the current quarter and then we’ll just gauge it as we go. But, underutilization charges are having a pretty significant impact on our gross margin and our operating results. And on top of that, then we’re building inventory and because we don’t have great historical sales at this point in time, looking backward a quarter and then as we look forward don’t have a lot of backlog, our inventory reserve charges have been quite high also. And, that at some point in time is going to provide a tailwind to gross margin as the environment improves.
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Ganesh, when we look across the space, there seems to be kind of a wide range of corrections that we have seen across the diversified names, right? It seems like microcontrollers have been more impacted than analog, industrial more exposed than autos, but this combination of microcontrollers and industrial has corrected the most. What would you attribute that deal, because, it’s just hard to imagine this kind of 50% plus peak hopefully trough correction? And then, what is giving you the confidence that this is an industry and a cycle issue and maybe is there something company specific in terms of share shifts or China in sourcing? But, just give us kind of the perspective of how is Microchip stacking up versus the industry that you’re in.
Ganesh Moorthy: No, I think you’re right that this is an asynchronous up cycle and down cycle. And so, depending on exposure to end markets and exposure to certain regions of the world, results are going to be different. I think as I mentioned a quarter ago at our conference call, there was also different ways in which people tried to deal with the up cycle and how to tackle the demand ferocity that was taking place at the time. And so, there is an overhang obviously that Microchip has, and I think many others have had, but to different degrees, that is based on what people were buying in excess of what they needed. And so all of that has to correct and come through. Now, what gives us confidence in our business is the connection to the customers that we have on programs, on plans that they have. And really, as they give us more visibility into what is happening with their customers and their channels, the change in revenue isn’t because revenue is moving from one supplier to a different supplier. It’s really customers who got very, very optimistic, built ahead of demand thinking that their historical in ‘21, ‘22 time frame was going to be persistent demand. And then, they ran into a macro issue where not only do they have high growth plans, higher inventory but a much slowing demand. So, those are all what is correcting through. The customers we have remain the customers that are working with us. We are working with them on next generation programs that they will launch as they get to the point where the current inventory is burned off and the new product can be launched. But, our confidence comes from this is a market that has long cycles, long design-in, long production cycles, and we just need to get through. We’re not in the early innings of a correction. We’re in the later innings of the correction. And, that’s why our confidence is that this thing will turn around. It has turned around. And, just as when we were on the upside, it looked like it was impossible to know how could we ever satisfy the demand. On the down cycle, you get the sense that how can we ever turn this thing around. But it does happen. It is a cyclical industry and it will happen.
Vivek Arya: Got it. For my follow-up, just kind of near-term clarification, what is the level of turns business that you are assuming for December versus normal? And then, I know March is still a little bit have further away, but if I go back in history pre-COVID, usually your March sales tended to be flat to up 1%, 2%. So, any conceptual way you would help us kind of think through what March might look like? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Let me take the second one and then I’ll let Eric speak to the first one. I think it’s with that little visibility as we have, we have a hard enough time trying to call the December quarter, let alone the March quarter. But the puts and takes of March typically are we’ll see the Chinese New Year, and usually there’s about a 10-day or 14-day impact that comes. So, that’s the headwind. The tailwind is we have fewer production holidays in the Western countries in Europe and the Americas. And so, you get more production days that happens and typically those have strength. And, then you have to put into place whatever else takes place in terms of inventory that has been destocked and needs to be starting to building closer to consumption. So, a lot of puts and takes that go with it, but we’re far away from trying to have visibility into the March quarter as we struggle through getting enough visibility into the December quarter. I’ll let Eric answer the first question relative to the turns.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes, so we don’t break out turns specifically. Ganesh gave commentary that bookings continue to be weak in the September quarter. They were pretty much in-line with where bookings were in the June quarter, and our book-to-bill was below parity. So, our visibility continues to be not great out in time, but we’ve got short lead times and inventory available and can respond quite quickly. And, the orders that we are receiving from customers now are more in-line with where our lead times are, and we’re well-positioned for that. So, the level of turns that we need is not outside of what we’ve seen historically, Microchip to be able to execute on and is obviously contemplated in the range of guidance that we gave today.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had two questions as well. My first one, I’m just curious how you’re thinking about the gap today that exists between what you’re selling in versus what is being sold through. And, I know you don’t have perfect visibility, but your December quarter revenue outlook, I think at the midpoint is 20% or 25% below where you were pre-pandemic. And, if I recall correctly, late 2019 back then you were going through a cyclical correction. So, you must be shipping well, well below what’s being consumed. I’m curious if you have an estimation of how big that gap could be today?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, we absolutely agree with you. We are shipping considerably under where consumption is taking place. As I speak to our customers, define how are they seeing the business, right? It is nowhere close to the magnitude of what our business is going through. And, I think that is the bullwhip effect we’re seeing on the reverse side where they’re trying to manage through their inventory, their channels and where they’re at, plus some macros that they’re good macro thing they’re going through. But, our customer business is down substantially less than what our business is down. And, that is what gives us the comfort that as they correct the inventory, they have to go back to a consumption level that is a lot higher than where we’re at today.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. And then as my follow-up, I’m curious how you’re thinking about blended pricing into calendar ‘25. And I know Ganesh, historically you’ve said that you operate a strategic business and it’s less transactional than it used to be back in the day. But, you’ve had a couple of peers point to low-single-digit declines in next year, mid-single-digit declines in next year. I’m curious how at Microchip you’re thinking about pricing as of today? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: I think in general, our direction hasn’t changed. Our pricing is pretty consistent year-over-year. The environment for new designs is, of course, a lot more competitive. There are players who are, in some cases, being more aggressive than they were historically at, and we will match them to make sure that in the business that is important to us. But, we also have a substantial discipline in our process and how we go run it. And remember, it isn’t just pricing, but we also have cost reductions that we’re bringing on, which is what are we doing from in terms of design shrinks and other things we can do to be able to drive the margin side of the equation as well. So, will there be pricing pressure as we go throughout 2025? Yes. But a lot of it is going to be on new designs as they start to go into production. And, we’ll have a substantial amount of existing designs that will continue to stay with where our pricing and turns are today.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. I guess, first question is on what you’ve been seeing by geography and looks like there’s some sharp differences there with particularly what you’re seeing in Europe. And is that just simply end market dependent, I guess, saying that with the exposure to industrial and auto there? In addition, we’ve seen some others in the space talk about some strength in China. Can you speak to that and if that’s been a partial offset for you?
Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So, Europe has a couple of factors in it. Historically, I don’t know for whatever reason, Europe seems to enter cycle one to two quarters behind when we see it in the Americas. So, on a down cycle, they start a little bit slower than that. But a big part of what we’re seeing in Europe and the large sequential decline that we have seen and year-over-year declines we’ve seen have been the high percentage of industrial and automotive end market customers that we have there. So yes, and I think you’ve seen that in the commentary for many others, and I see that in the commentary for many other industries with high exposure to Europe as well as that’s where the biggest challenges are for anyone with a large industrial and automotive side of the business. With respect to the other geographies, your question was about China. I would say that and we don’t quite break out China, but when you look at Greater China for us, which is Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, all combined on it, Of the four regions or the three regions, the subset of Asia that represents Greater China would be the one where at least there is not weakness. There’s not great strength, but it doesn’t have the same weakness as we see in Europe and the Americas.
Chris Caso: Got it. As a follow-up, you mentioned in the prepared remarks about some borrowing that you were contemplating around the dividend. I wonder if you could give some of the details around that, some of the background of why you’re choosing to do that. And maybe more broadly, given the downturn that’s lasting longer than most of us have thought, what’s kind of your general view towards the borrowing levels right now?
Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So maybe I miscommunicated in my prepared remarks. So let me go through them again. In any given quarter, the adjusted free cash flow we generate will vary depending on various actions, particularly when we have concentrations of tax payments or interest payments, which happen a little bit more lumpy. In that quarter, we may generate lower less adjusted free cash flow than the dividend that we pay. And all that I was trying to say is that in subsequent quarters, what we would do is take some of the adjusted free cash flow that was in excess of the dividend and compensate for that so that we didn’t have a net borrowing between quarters where the adjusted free cash flow was less than the dividend payment. So, it’s really borrowing from within Microchip, not so much borrowing from the bank. We did in the last quarter, as Eric said in his prepared remarks, have to increase the debt in order to pay the dividend because our adjusted free cash flow was lower than what the dividend payment was. And there will be subsequent quarters as we go back into a recovery where we will generate more. And what we will do is just bring the debt level down so that the 100% capital return can still happen without raising the aggregate debt. Do you want to add anything to that, Eric?
Eric Bjornholt: Just maybe take a real simple example. So if, for example, the dividend in the current quarter is in excess of the prior quarter’s free cash flow calculation by $100 million and then we fast forward to the June quarter of next year and hypothetically the adjusted free cash flow is $200 million higher than what the dividend would be. But forward we would start buying back stock, we would back out that $100 million that in Ganesh’s kind of terminology we borrowed in the current quarter to pay the dividend. So, over the course of time, it’s 100% free cash flow return.
Chris Caso: Without a structural increase in debt levels, yes.
Ganesh Moorthy: That’s exactly what we’re targeting.
Eric Bjornholt: And a commitment to our shareholders that the dividend is strong and continue to be there and that our cash generations continue to be strong over the long-term.
Chris Caso: Okay, got it. That’s clear. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Blayne Curtis from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Blayne Curtis: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I have two. Just kind of curious on the message on the guidance. So, it sounded like last quarter you were hopeful of some green shoots. You said they were uneven. So, I’m just kind of curious, are you seeing any areas either product wise or geography that you’re feeling better about? And then I guess for the guidance, it sounds like you’re just assuming less turns. Is that anything you’re seeing? Or is just as you explained seasonal and you’re just being conservative on that?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, as I mentioned, the two places where we continue to see strength is in aerospace and defense as well as the AI subset of data centers. So that has been continuing now for multiple quarters. I think in this quarter, beyond the normal macroeconomic forces and all that stuff also is we know that the quarter ends in December when there are more holidays and so less production days and people will take the opportunity to tamp down any production plans as well as to cut back on inventory because many of them have year-end for their balance sheets and they want to have a balance sheet without excess inventory sitting on it. And we’ve already heard from some customers who have production shutdowns that are in the latter part of the quarter. So, I think all of that plays into us trying to get a sense of kind of where is this quarter going to go. And at this point in time, I think the guidance tries to reflect that combination of what are we able to do, what are we expecting will come and where are the places where there’s going to be some challenges to work through.
Eric Bjornholt: Right. And just to clarify, we didn’t break out the turns percentage. We aren’t necessarily expecting less turns, but our backlog has continued to fall as our book-to-bill has been less than 1%.
Blayne Curtis: Got you. And then maybe just on OpEx over the next couple of quarters here. I had thought that you had some pay cuts that would kind of come back in. I’m assuming with lower forecast though maybe the variable comp is down from I think you’re guiding it up $12 million sequentially for December. But how do you think about the next few quarters beyond that?
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. So, on a non-GAAP basis, it’s a little bit more at the midpoint of guidance, a little bit more than $8 million up quarter-on-quarter, December to September. And then we are reinstating the salary cut, taking the majority of employees that are kind of below a director level back to 100% salary this quarter, and that is factored into that $8 million increase. And so I would expect that OpEx, because we’ll have a full quarter of that effect in the March quarter will go up again in dollars and we’ll see where the revenue comes in terms of percentage of sales and all that. But those are things that we feel that we need to do. Our employees will have been on a pay cut for nine months and we want to make sure that we’ve got an engaged group that is being compensated for the work that they’re performing.
Blayne Curtis: Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Rolland from Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead.
Christopher Rolland: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. You had some comments about some data center products, which was nice to see, PCI switching, some SSD, SXL, some other stuff as well. I guess a couple of questions here, like is there a home run product amongst this group? Is this outgrowing, I would assume, the rest of your other end markets? The last update that you guys had, I think data center was 18% of revenue, but it hasn’t necessarily grown over time. Would you expect given this product lineup for data center to expand as a percentage of your total over time? Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: So, in the long run, we are very confident about data center as an end market, as a megatrend and our participation in the opportunities within that. And it’s pretty broad in terms of what all we bring in there. In the short run, the data center subset, which is driven by accelerated computing or the AI portion of the subset. And we had estimated that to be about 30-ish percent of the overall data center revenue we have. That is, in fact, continuing to be strong and growing. But as you know, overall data center budgets are being squeezed on the non-AI portion of what they’re spending. And eventually, it will come back because they do need to go back and put some of that infrastructure in place. But today, the data center overall growth is constrained because the non-AI portion does not have the same capital expenses that end customers are putting in place while they build out some of the AI infrastructure at the pace that it’s going on. But long run, AI or the data center is a huge opportunity for us with multiple growth areas inside of it.
Christopher Rolland: Very good. Perhaps secondly, CapEx, it seems like you guys paused your silicon. I was wondering longer term, how should we be thinking about CapEx? And you mentioned also an update on the CHIPS Act. Remind us what you’re playing for there and the timing of payments? Thanks.
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. Well, I’ll answer the CapEx question. So, our CapEx for the current fiscal year, which will end in March is expected to be about $150 million. It was pretty front end loaded where we had about $70 million in the June quarter and then it’s going to be at this lower rate through the end of the fiscal year. We do expect fiscal ‘26 CapEx to be even lower than fiscal ‘25 and that’s because we’ve made a lot of investments in capacity that we need to grow back into. During the up cycle, we were planning for growth and brought in a bunch of equipment that’s been received now that is sitting in a undepreciated state that we can deploy. So, we’ve got maintenance CapEx, obviously we’ll be investing in growth areas of the business, but CapEx, I expect to be quite low again in fiscal 2026. For CHIPS Act. I’ll turn it back to Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: So, we don’t yet have an agreement on the CHIPS Act. We’re working through it. We’re optimistic about it. I think the CHIPS Act has a piece of it, which is the investment tax credit. It’s been taking place over some time. But we would need to be deploying capital to be able to take advantage of that, and that will happen in time, but it’s not something near-term we need to go off and do. And then there are grants, and those grants are the ones we’re still negotiating. And those would be determined based on when would we bring on capabilities or capacity consistent with what those grants were delivered for. So I’m not looking for any short term benefit that comes out of the CHIPS Act in the next one, two quarters or so. But over a three, four, five year period of time, as demand returns, as we continue to expand and deploy the capital we have and live up to the commitments that we’re making into the CHIPS Act, they will all be beneficial to us.
Christopher Rolland: Excellent. Thanks, Ganesh. Thanks, Eric.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Lots of questions on the near-term cyclical dynamics. Maybe just one from me on your products and technology. So, you guys mentioned your customers are back to focusing on innovation, your TSS strategy continues to play out. The team has a very comprehensive system in place, right, to track the opportunity pipeline, also content growth opportunity. I don’t know, can you guys quantify how successful TSS has been? How has the Microchip dollar content per customer opportunity increased over the past several years? Any way to convey your success with TSS?
Ganesh Moorthy: No, it’s more we have because we have 120,000 customers, a substantial number of them through the distribution channel, it’s hard to pick that data off on a very consistent basis. But we do have subsets of what we look at, subsets of some of the large customers, subsets sets of specific megatrends, subsets of things. And so internally, we track as we look at these subsets, how is it performing and really the same processes we know are creating that multiplier effect in other places as well. So, I think that’s the best way. We don’t break it down by each initiative or each megatrend in terms of what we’re doing. But we do know and we do see that the TSS reflected by the total content in these applications is growing in the areas that we’re focused on. And we’ll think about is there a way to provide some of that insight. And over the years, we have shown some of the customer designs without putting any names on them, showing all the different content. It doesn’t go to your question of dollars, but it does go to your question of content. And maybe we’ll bring some of that back into the investor circuit. Did you have any other?
Richard J. Simoncic: Yes. You know, Meta, maybe a good way for you to look at that too is on our website. We now have a very extensive reference design section that we’re adding reference designs to every quarter. And you could probably see from that what markets and about how many devices are in each of those reference designs for those target applications. And that gives you a good idea of where we’re targeting and what’s happening.
Harlan Sur: Yes. Okay. Thank you. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thanks, Harlan.
Operator: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. Ganesh, I had a question on your turns business. I mean, I assume the percentage each quarter now is very, very high. You obviously have short lead times, you have inventory, but so do your peers. So, I’m just curious what’s your view on how long we’re going to be in this period. And I’m not suggesting maybe revenue is going down every quarter, but could we be in a very high terms environment for a while just given all the inventory that all the broad based, I mean, the companies have at this point?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. It’s hard to tell, right? So I mean, let me reverse the thing, go back to the middle of 2023. We had 52 week lead times, and it looked like lead times would never come down. And pretty soon, it rapidly [unbound] (ph). And I think the reverse could happen here as well. What will determine this is when do customers either feel the need to place backlog because they feel there is risk if they don’t place it or have confidence in their business and say, hey, I want to get going with it. Right now, our customers in the markets that we’ve described are uncertain about their business, are uncertain what is the rate at which their inventory will drain, their new orders will come in at. And as long as they’re uncertain and there are short lead times available, there’s no need to place backlog. And if they don’t place backlog, that means we have higher turns that go with it. It will turn around, and it will turn around when they get to the point where they either get concerned, they may not get product because they need to place a backlog or they get confidence in their own business having turned around. Anyhow some of the things the external conditions have started to -- with interest rates starting to come down, that is a good stimulus in the right direction. It’s happening here. It’s happening in Europe. I think we got to get some of the uncertainty with the elections and some of that stuff out of the way. But as all that works out and every quarter, inventory is draining, right, which means that their margin of error, if they don’t place orders, is increasing. And I think all of that will come back. But how it comes back and how fast it comes back is not very predictable. But we have seen it, and we have seen it come back pretty quickly when we thought it’s going to be here and taking a long, long time before it recovers.
Tore Svanberg: Well, that’s great color. As my follow-up for Eric. Eric, so on CapEx, obviously, it’s going to be lower in next fiscal years. But from a capacity perspective that Microchip has, and I do recognize that you obviously outsource too, right? But I mean, is it fair to say that the company can double its quarterly revenue with basically just maintenance CapEx at this point?
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. I mean, in theory, if the mix stayed what it was today, we could do that. What the mix is going to be out when we at where we get there, it’s hard to tell, right? And we’ll have new products that accelerate their pace in the marketplace and we’ll need to make investments to support that. So, it’s not a completely straightforward answer. It’ll be somewhat mix dependent, but we’ve got a lot of capacity to grow back into.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from William Stein from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
William Stein: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I’d like to ask about the green shoots as you characterize them and the uneven way that they’re playing out. This sounds to me as an outsider looking into the company that this is essentially just expedites, which are easy to sort of confuse as like, upsides or urgent demands when in reality the customers are just depending on you to have ever shorter lead times. How do you distinguish between those two sort of demand triggers? And where do you think the mix like are there a lot of customers that are viewing demand in the way that they really need upside or they need it faster than before it’s real pull ins or should I think of this mostly as just responding to your very short lead times?
Ganesh Moorthy: I’m sure customers are taking advantage of the fact that there are short lead times. But we also know that we have customers who didn’t have to place and didn’t place orders for two or three quarters, and they have started to place orders. And in some cases, they had previously placed orders for farther out in time, but now recognize that they have used up what they had placed and need to pull in. So those are the effects that we see. And the fact that we have short lead times is just our ability to then respond to what they are seeing as the demand signals. They don’t have very much visibility in their demand signals. But as they sell through, they recognize they need to build more. And as they need to build more, they’re starting to place orders on us or place orders on us with short lead times or pulling in orders previously placed on it. Those are the green shoots that we think reflect consumption and the need to place orders on it that are starting to get closer to where their consumption is at.
William Stein: One follow-up, if I can. I appreciate that answer, Ganesh. I think at the last Analyst Day, the company highlighted a 6% to 8% long-term growth, but then there was a conference call or an investor conference perhaps where the company cited a 10% to 15% long-term sales growth view. I’m not expecting you to update this or to tune that outlook up, but I think there’s a more basic question investors have, which is what sort of the what’s the actual rate of end demand even if it weren’t really growing much? So, we’re under shipping today. Clearly, you are over shipping at the peak. Do you have any, even if it’s a qualitative way to get at what you think sort of normalized demand is on a let’s call it sort of a sell-out basis or an end demand basis?
Ganesh Moorthy: The noise on that signal is so high, it’s hard to give you a useful number at this point in time. We were, for two years in a row, growing at 25% annually, and we didn’t take our growth rates up as that happened because we knew that these things run-in cycles. Today, we’re in a deep down cycle and we’re not trying to reflect that this is how it’s going to be. So, I don’t have a good answer. I think we’ve gone through the most unusual cycles here in the last three plus years. We’re all trying to get our bearings on, okay, what part of that cycle was a secular growth versus what were things that were maybe pull aheads because of COVID or because of other issues, etcetera. I don’t think anybody knows precisely where that is. So, I don’t want to give you an answer today reflecting where today’s end of the cycle is just so they didn’t want to give an answer that was optimistic when the upper end of the cycle was there.
Eric Bjornholt: And we really feel that our focus on these areas that we call the megatrends where our products play, that we think are the faster area, growing areas of the market that we can participate in as well as TSS is going to allow us to consistently gain market share over time.
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, I think the way if I step back and look at it, I look and say, okay, there’s a lot of noise in the short-term, etcetera. But how is innovation in what you and I and others and everybody else counts on and uses in what we do and how we run things, etcetera, being delivered? And that innovation has a substantial semiconductor content on which it’s being delivered. And if you believe that, that semiconductor content is essential for how growth and innovation is being delivered by the customer base, for all of us as consumers to be able to take advantage, right, there’s a lot of optimism around where this thing goes in the long-term. But the noise in the short-term is just too high to be able to discern where that is in the long-term.
William Stein: Great. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Danely from Citi. Please go ahead.
Chris Danely: Hey, thanks guys. So, clearly this downturn has gone on longer and deeper and farther than any of us expected. If we’re still in this muck, let’s call it another couple of quarters or whatever, is there any risk of an inventory write down or restructuring or would you guys have to cut the dividend?
Eric Bjornholt: So, I think the answer to that on a cut in the dividend or a significant inventory write down, those aren’t things that we lose sleep over. Our products have really long lives. We know this is going to come back. Timing of that and the size of the bounce back is hard to predict. But that’s not anything that we’re worried about. The cash generation from this business is there and the dividend is there to stay. I don’t know if I’ve addressed all pieces of your question. Was there anything else?
Chris Danely: No, that’s fine. And then the last one is a little provocative. So some of your or most of your peers have already reported and I’m sure you see that your sales are down substantially more than any of the competitors. Why is there not anything sort of wrong with Microchip? Or what do you attribute your deeper sales decline versus all of the competitors to?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, I talked about it a quarter ago. I think if you aggregate over time, we had a steeper increase, too, if you go back and look at 2022 and 2023. And so did some of our shipments take place ahead of what others were at? We all have had different ways in which we have navigated through the cycle. Clearly, for many of our customers in the industrial marketplace and some in the automotive marketplace, they also had policies about carrying far more inventory. They were building quite valuable end products. And so some of those customers have had a higher inventory that they’re starting from which they’re burning down. But when I look at the aggregate of how much revenue on an index basis has everybody been able to generate going back to the December quarter before COVID, so December 2019, I think you’ll find that the total area under the curve is very similar. That said, we’re down significantly, and therefore, we expect that the opportunity to grow significantly is also an important part of what is ahead of us in Microchip.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. And I think with that growth, should come a nice acceleration, return to a more normalized level in our operating profit, which is obviously down significantly at this point in time. So, I think that’s an opportunity.
Chris Danely: That’s fair. Thanks, guys.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Our next question is from Joshua Buchalter from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joshua Buchalter: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. As we bridge to the December quarter gross margin, any help you can give us on expectations for directionally? I know you usually don’t comment on utilization rates, but directionally how you would expect underutilization charges to trend in the quarter and maybe similar question regarding expectations for potential inventory write downs? I know that’s been moving a little bit the last few quarters. Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. I think it’s going to be more of the same of what we’ve seen in the last couple of quarters that we’re going to continue to run the factories at much less than optimal utilization. So, those underutilization charge are going to be with us. And so we’ll have the manufacturing teams executing on that and inventory reserves are going to be a result of where inventory ends up and where our sales for the quarter and over the last couple of periods are going be. So, inventory reserves are going to be high again. And the good thing is we don’t believe we’re building inventory that isn’t going to sell, right? Long live products are really going to help us in the future. And even though we’ll have a write down currently, the chances of that inventory selling through at some point in the future are quite high.
Joshua Buchalter: Okay. Thank you. And then maybe a bigger picture question. I mean, the [disty] (ph) is obviously an issue right now and where you still have work to do on the inventory side. And I mean through this cycle, a lot of your peers have sort of de-emphasized the channel and distribution partners. I’m just wondering, I guess coming out of this cycle, are you thinking about your relationship and the importance of the channel and how you expect it to treat it, I guess, long-term strategically as you prioritize your inventory? I’d be curious of your thoughts coming out of the cycle. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: We have, I think somewhere in the order of about 100 channel partners across the world. They’re an important part of our sales process. They reach a large number of customers that we would not be individually able to go. We have different models by which we work with them based on the work that they’re able to do and the results that they’re able to provide. And we believe that channel partners remain an important part of our strategy. They’ve been hanging right about at the 50% plus or minus 5%, 10% for a long time to come. But we do evolve how do we work with them and how do we work to incentivize and also compensate for performance with them.
Joshua Buchalter: Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Harsh Kumar: Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Ganesh, I had a question on pricing, in the cycle. This is a period of kind of high capacity, low product uptake. I was curious as you’re negotiating prices with your customers, for your next contract for the next 12 months, are you starting to see any pressure at this point in time or is pricing still pretty firm?
Ganesh Moorthy: There’s always pressure, right? Any purchasing manager worth their salt would be pushing for that. The question is, what is a reasonable deal that allows a win-win outcome that comes from it? And what is the true risk of losing something on price? And the vast majority of our products are designed in, have long design in cycles, long production cycles that go with them. But we’re business people and we work to make sure that if we can make the pie bigger and generate a significant amount of overall business that for both the customer and for us is a good win-win relationship, we’ll go with it. But I would say in the aggregate, that isn’t what is moving gross margins for us. It’s really at this point in time some of the underutilization and other issues. Pricing on a long term basis is a lot more stable, a lot more disciplined.
Harsh Kumar: Got it. And for my last question, Ganesh, you talked about green shoots. This is the second quarter, I think, you’re seeing the signs of cancellation. And this is probably very typical of being at the bottom. But I was curious if you could give us some color on these green shoots. Are these green shoots getting stronger for you? Are they just about the same? I mean, I’m kind of nit-picking here, but I want to see if there’s something to be taken away from the demand signals that you are seeing at the bottom.
Ganesh Moorthy: It’s hard to tell. I would say the green shoots were a lot greener two quarters ago. And at this point in time, they’re still green but maybe not quite as green. I think there’s a malaise in terms of where the market is at. We’re seeing the expedites, the pull-ins continuing to rise, so that’s goodness. We are seeing the cancellations and all of that has bottomed out. That’s good news. What we haven’t seen quite yet is sufficient confidence in customers to give us more bookings and backlog because they don’t have quite that same confidence. So, I think that’s the missing piece that we want to see come through.
Harsh Kumar: Thanks, Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: Great. Thanks, Harsh.
Operator: The next question here is from Janet Ramkissoon from Quadra Capital. Please go ahead.
Janet Ramkissoon: Yes. It’s just a follow-up on the CHIPS Act, question that was asked before. I just wanted to make sure that I understand this right. You were awarded, what do you talk of an award in brackets for a $162 million and $90 million was for the expansion of the Colorado Springs facility, and $72 million was for a fab expansion in Oregon. And from January to today, one would think that something would have happened. Is it the situation where the commerce department just made these awards and it’s a situation where it’s very difficult for you to meet your requirements to actually get these grants? Is there any color that you could provide that could help us understand why this was awarded and nothing has happened?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, let me kick it off and then I’ll hand it to Rich. So, what you’re referring to in January was what’s called a preliminary memorandum of terms. So, it’s really an LOI, so to speak. It needed work to be done. They needed to do due diligence and then there was an agreement and put work. We have worked through a fair amount. And the Commerce Department, this is new for the Chip’s office in terms of what needed to happen. So, there was a lot of learning for us and for them in terms of where it’s at. We’ve run into things that were not necessarily the right answer for Microchip that we have to educate them on. But we have worked through a lot of that at this point in time. And maybe I’ll let Rich speak to it because he’s been spearheading that for Microchip in terms of where we are and kind of why we feel at this point that there is a reasonable chance that we might get the final agreement done this year.
Richard J. Simoncic: This is probably the first true public private partnership with government in terms of investment in the U.S. and as Ganesh said, there was quite a bit of learning on both sides in terms of what it took to invest and grow this industry. This semiconductor device is probably the most complex industrial product that we make with some of the longest cycle times and the most capital intensive industry that there is out there today. And so there was a great deal of education back and forth. In most cases, federal government is dealing with much simpler products that they had to deal with and not something as complex or high-tech as making a semiconductor chip and not familiar with just how intertwined the world’s supply chain and support chain is to make a semiconductor chip. It’s not contained in one geography or one area. To make a chip or install equipment in a factory, we need support from all over the world to make that happen. And so as Ganesh said, it took a while to get through and educate each other on what was needed. There was quite a bit of constituents within Washington that weighed in on the CHIPS Act, and we had to go through and work with those various constituents to make sure that we met their needs as well as the business needs as well as the structural needs of the CHIPS Act in terms of what it was intended for.
Janet Ramkissoon: So, did you do have some equipment that you haven’t deployed yet. At any time, did you feel that you were just trying to get one step ahead in terms of buying equipment to meet the obligations that you would have if you got that $162 million with the breakdown for Colorado Springs and Oregon. It does require a little bit of lead time to be able to deliver whatever you’re promising or wherever the Commerce Department thinks that they’re getting. So, do you feel like you tried to order equipment a little earlier because you think you felt that you were going to get this [funding] (ph)?
Ganesh Moorthy: No. So, we ran the business the way we needed to run the business. We want running the business to be able to time it with something that the CHIPS Act would end up having to go do. It was all running in parallel. Obviously, the markets have changed and things have changed. But all of what we did largely is driven by what do we need to do to run the business.
Janet Ramkissoon: Thanks very much for the color. I appreciate it.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thanks, Janet.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the floor back to Mr. Moorthy for any closing comments.
Ganesh Moorthy: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for your patience in sitting through the meeting. And we appreciate the questions, and we look forward to meeting many of you on the road in the coming weeks. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.

===== 2025 Q1  (2024-08-01 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Microchip First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Eric Bjornholt, CFO. Please go ahead.
Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; Rich Simoncic, Microchip's COO; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2025 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliations on our website. Net sales in the June quarter were $1.241 billion which was down 6.4% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were just below the midpoint of our guidance at 59.9%, including capacity underutilization charges of $36 million as we continue to manage production activities to adjust to the challenging business conditions. Operating expenses were at 28.4% of net sales and operating income was 31.5%. Non-GAAP net income was $289.9 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.53 which was $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis in the June quarter, gross margins were 59.4%. Total operating expenses were $517.8 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $123 million, special charges of $2.6 million, share-based compensation of $37.4 million and $1.8 million of other expenses. GAAP net income was $129.3 million, resulting in $0.24 in earnings per diluted share. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 13% in the June quarter which was in line with our guidance. Our non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal year '25 is expected to be about 13% which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchip's non-GAAP tax rate in future periods. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2024, was $1.308 billion which was down $8 million from the end of the March 2024 quarter. We had 237 days of inventory at the end of the June quarter which was up 13 days from the prior quarter's levels as a result of a lower dollar value of quarterly cost of goods sold from lower sequential revenue. At the midpoint of our September 2024 quarter guidance, we would expect inventory dollars to be up modestly and days of inventory to increase. We also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end-of-life by our supply chain partners and these last-time buys represented 19 days of inventory at the end of June. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter was at 43 days which was up 2 days from the prior quarter's level. Distribution took down their inventory holdings in the June quarter as distribution sell-through was about $85 million higher than distribution sell in. Our cash flow from operating activities was $377.1 million in the June quarter; adjusted free cash flow was $301.3 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $315.1 million. Our total debt increased by $179 million in the June quarter and our net debt increased by $183.6 million. The increase in debt was impacted by our refinancing activities in the quarter which included issuing a 0.75% 6-year convertible bond, for which we paid $105 million for a 75% cap call to provide some protection from future equity dilution from stock price appreciation. Our adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was $456.2 million and 36.8% of net sales, Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $2.908 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.02x as of June 30, 2024, up from 1.29x at June 30, 2023. Capital expenditures were $72.9 million in the June quarter. Our expectations for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2025 is about $175 million and is more heavily weighted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 as we had worked with our suppliers to push out capital that was originally planned for delivery last fiscal year. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $43 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric and good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter results were consistent with our guidance, with net sales down 6.4% sequentially as we continue to navigate through a major inventory correction. Non-GAAP gross margin came in just under the midpoint of our guidance of 59.9%, while non-GAAP operating margin was at the midpoint of our guidance at 31.5% as we continued our strong expense control programs. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in $0.01 ahead of guidance at $0.53 per share. Our sequential revenue decline resulted in June quarter adjusted EBITDA dropping. And as a result, our net leverage rose to 2.02x. We expect our net leverage to rise modestly for a few more quarters as trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA drops when replacing stronger prior year quarters with weaker current year quarters. However, our cash generation continues to be solid and we remain committed to our capital return plan. Our capital return to shareholders in the September quarter will increase to 92.5% of our June quarter adjusted free cash flow as we continue on our path to return 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter of calendar year 2025. My thanks to our worldwide team for their support, hard work and diligence as we continue to navigate a difficult environment and focus on actions that we believe position us well to thrive in the long term. In early July, we announced our entry into the 64-bit embedded microprocessor market with a suite of products, developments to address high-performance embedded processing applications, including AI-enabled edge solutions. This extends our strong 32-bit embedded microprocessor portfolio to higher performance and increased capabilities while preserving Microchip's historically strong ecosystem of leading development tools to make adoption easy for embedded system design engineers. Microchip is the only company to offer the widest embedded control and processing platform from 8 to 64 bit as well as FPGAs with a common development to ecosystem, that's empowering customers to innovate and reuse their work across a wide spectrum of markets and applications. Now for some color on the June quarter and the general business environment. All regions of the world and most of our end markets exhibited varying degrees of weakness. The exceptions were Aerospace and Defense which was stable and the artificial intelligence subset of data centers which continue to be strong. Our business in Europe and America which are dominated by industrial and automotive markets were particularly weak on the heels of a very weak March quarter. Our broad base of customers continue to manage their inventory tightly and adjust their business plans in the midst of a weak macro environment for manufacturing, high interest rates, very short lead times and an uncertain business outlook. This combination of factors we believe is driving inventory destocking as well as reductions in target inventory levels in multiple areas. At our direct customers, at contract manufacturers and distributors who buy from us at our indirect customers who buy through our distributors and in many cases, at our customers' customers. The early signs of green shoots in our business we saw in February, March and April have continued to progress, although at an uneven pace, with bookings up sequentially in some months and relatively flat sequentially in other months. Although quarterly bookings grew close to 50% in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter, overall bookings were still below where we would like to see them. Bookings, however, continue to age over a shorter period of time. And we continue to see many requests for expedites of new orders and shipment date pull-ins for previously placed orders request for cancellations and pushouts continue to subside. Our average lead time continue to be about 8 weeks or less, while the short lead times are resulting in reduced near-term visibility as customers delay placing orders since they have high confidence that supply is readily available. We also believe short lead times during a period of business uncertainty are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed with us. We have adjusted our operational systems to adapt to this uncertain environment and preposition semi-finished and finished goods inventory as best as we can to accept and ship the turns orders we need this quarter. Given the severity of the down cycle, our factories around the world are continuing to run at lower utilization rates in order to help control inventory levels. Our internal capacity expansion actions remain paused. We expect our capital investments in fiscal '25 and likely in fiscal '26 as well, will be low as we will use the inventory we have invested in as well as our underutilized capacity to support the next up cycle. We're also prepared for the long-term growth of our business. On the 1 hand, in partnership with our foundry and outsourced assembly and test partners. And on the other hand, for our internal factories, with the optionality of deploying capital which we have purchased but not yet placed into service. While neither we, nor our customers know the shape of the recovery in the coming months, we do expect it to arrive advertise in all prior semiconductor cycle. And we believe we are well prepared for the things we can control to exploit whatever the market recovery looks like. On the chip stack front, we continue to work through a number of challenges with the chips office and other government departments in regards to the grants. While the investment tax credit process has been relatively straightforward and we are greatly appreciative of this benefit. The journey to receive grants has taken much longer and been more complicated than we expected. Recall, we announced a preliminary memorandum of terms in early January 2024 and supported the completion of diligence by March. Given that we align extremely well with the U.S. government's goals of shoring up semiconductor supply for national security and industrial security, it would be unfortunate if a pragmatic agreement on the conditions attached to the grants cannot be reached. We continue to persevere through the challenges by collaborating with the chip's office while remaining resolute that whatever agreement we reach must also be consistent with our business values. Before we get into our guidance, I note about the strength of our design in activity. After 2-plus years of dealing with shortages and redeploying their innovation resources towards mitigating the impact of shortages, our customers over the last year plus have returned to prioritizing their innovation projects. The result is a strong design-in pipeline for us across all end markets, mega trends and key customers amplified by our total system solutions approach to take advantage of our broad portfolio of solutions. The impact of this growing design pipeline is muted in the current environment where excess inventory gets most of the attention and design-in activity takes time to gestate into production. But design win momentum is the engine of long-term growth that we have always focused on and which we expect will drive above-market long-term growth. Now let's get into our guidance for the September quarter. While we continue to see a number of green shoots in our business indicators, we do need turns orders within the quarter to meet our guidance, operating in a high turns environment has historically been normal for Microchip but it's challenging to predict during abnormal times as we're in today. We are, however, forecasting strong signs of growth in our data center business beyond the artificial intelligence subset after several quarters of weakness. This is effectively another green shoot. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, especially the very low backlog visibility we are faced with. We expect our net sales for the September quarter to be between $1.12 billion and $1.18 billion. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 58.5% and 59.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 30% and 31% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 27.5% and 29.5% of sales and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.40 and $0.46. This multiyear semiconductor cycle for Microchip and for the overall semiconductor industry has been like none other we had seen. It started with coveted supply and demand disruptions in the March quarter of 2020 which then continued for many months. This was followed by extreme product shortages and result in supply chain challenges later that year and for several quarters thereafter. And finally, a substantial inventory correction over the last several quarters. We recognize that on a peak to trough basis, our revenue decline has been sharper than many of our competitors. Some of this variance reflects the differences in end market exposure as this cycle has impacted different end markets at different times. Some of the variance is due to differences in noncancer gold, nonreschedulable programs implemented by us and our competitors. And finally, some of the variance is driven by differences in the relative size of business transacted either directly or through the channel. While peak across revenue performance is relevant, we believe a better longer-term indicator is a comparison of the cumulative revenue generated through the entire cycle. Assuming the December quarter of 2019 was the last unaffected or normal quarter, Microchip's cumulative revenue over the next 19 quarters, inclusive of our guidance from -- for the September 2024 quarter when indexed to the December quarter shows very comparable performance between us and our competitors. This is, of course, excluding the impact of acquisitions for everyone. The revenue peaks and trucks were different for each company. We believe for the factors that we mentioned earlier. However, when we're looking -- when looking at the cumulative 19-quarter revenue, essentially the area under the revenue curve is what that would represent. While the journey for each company was different that destination was very similar after 19 quarters. This would suggest that Microchip may be positioned for a sharper growth in the coming quarters, although we're not ready to predict the shape of that recovery at this time. My point is that rather than be focused on peak the trust performance alone, it seems prudent to consider the area under the curve of cumulative revenue performance as well. We believe the fundamental characteristics of growth, profitability and cash generation of our business remain intact. We are confident that our solutions remain the engine of innovation for the application of end markets we serve. We remain committed to executing our strategic imperatives which we believe will deliver sustained results and substantial shareholder value. And finally, at a time of macro uncertainty, we remain focused on the things we can control to create long-term shareholder value. With that, let me baton to Steve to talk more about our cash generation to shareholders. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to provide you with a further update on our cash return strategy. The Board of Directors approved an increase in the dividend of 10.7% from the year ago quarter to a record $0.454 per share. During the last quarter, we purchased $72.7 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $242.6 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $315.3 million. This quarter, our total cash return was reduced by the cash outlays for the recent acquisition of BSI and Euronics. When you combine the dividend buyback and acquisition-related cash outlays, this amount was 87.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $389.9 million during the March 2024 quarter. Our net leverage at the end of June 2024 quarter was 2.02x. Ever since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned a total of $4.6 billion to shareholders through June 30, 2024, by a combination of dividends and share buybacks. During this period, our share buyback in the open market was approximately 31.2 million shares representing approximately 5.8% of our shares outstanding. In the current September quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow level from the June quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. Our adjusted free cash flow for the June quarter was $301.3 million. So our target return to shareholders would be 92.5% of that amount, minus a small payment made for acquisitions. Our resulting cash return to shareholders will be approximately $261 million. Out of that amount, dividends are expected to be approximately $243.8 million and our expected stock buyback will be approximately $17.2 million. Going forward, we plan to continue to increase our adjusted free cash flow return to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of our adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. That will take 2 more quarters and we expect that dividend over the long run will represent approximately 50% of our cash returned. We also announced today that effective at the close of business on August 20 which is the date of our Annual Shareholders' Meeting, I will transition from Executive Chair to being the Non-Executive Chair of the Board. In this role, I will continue to be a resource to Ganesh and to all of Microchip. I want to thank our investors and our employees. It was my highest honor to have served you for 34 years. Let me now turn it back to Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Steve. On behalf of the Microchip leadership team and all of our employees worldwide, thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts. We have 34 years of service to Microchip. In your Nonexecutive Chair role, you will continue to be an important resource for me personally and for other Microchip team members as well. With that, Stacy, will you please pull for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: Ganesh, you talked about orders being up 50% sequentially but you said that they're still weak. Can you talk about that a little more? Is that -- are you just saying that book-to-bill is still well below 1? Is that the point there?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. I wouldn't say well below 1 book-to-bill is below 1. It has bookings have been growing. They've been growing unevenly between the months. So it's on the right track, just not as fast as we would like it to. And coming in they're aging faster. So that also helps.
Timothy Arcuri: Got it. And then can you talk a little bit more about -- you had talked about the green shoots and it sounds like they kind of stalled out a little bit. Can you talk about maybe when that happened in the quarter? Was it like the last month of the quarter? And has it continued through the first month of this quarter, just -- and maybe the end markets where that's actually happened.
Ganesh Moorthy: So at the end of May, I think we were at a public conference where we had said, "Hey, bookings are flattish for May versus April, June got a little bit better. I think it's just through the quarter week to week. I think these are short-term indicators. We have to look at it kind of on a longer-term basis, how is it evolving? So -- but yes, June did not have the same momentum that we would have expected. If this was continuing at a consistent pace. And so that's the difference between what we saw in April versus May versus June. It just didn't have a consistency throughout the quarter. And there's no particular end market thing. The 2 end markets I referred to, stability in aerospace and defense, strengthen the data center market. And of course, we're indicating that it's not only the AI subset but going forward for September and December, we're seeing strength across the data center markets that we're in.
Operator: Next question, Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International Group.
Christopher Rolland: Mine is around utilizations and where we go from here. So I think you guys had some shutdowns in June? Are you expecting to continue those into September? And then you also talked about external wafer supply agreements, would you expect those negotiations to go well and to push those out? Or might those effect as well?
Eric Bjornholt: So I'll start with internal utilization. So we are not planning on having another 2-week shutdown for our wafer fabs in the September quarter. We do not expect production value out of the fabs to be much different quarter-on-quarter. We continue to have attrition and had to lower starts because of that but we'll not be having another 2-week shutdown. And in our assembly and test areas, we will continue to have days off for those activities to manage our finished goods assembly and test out appropriately. Ganesh, do you want to comment on foundry?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. We have continued to work with our foundry partners on how to match the wafers coming in to the demand picture as it changes the degree of how we have worked that out has a different results at different semi -- foundry partners. But by and large, we are working through those with business arrangements to make sure that we are not receiving substantially more wafers than what we can use with the exception of the last time buy that Eric referred to, where factories are either closing down or processes are being end of life where we are buying because those products often have extremely high gross margins and it behoves us to be able to take the inventory and over many years, I realize very high gross margin on those parts.
Christopher Rolland: And then you didn't call out China as a source of additional weakness. I was wondering if we could maybe get an update there, what you're seeing out of China and/or Asia.
Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So in the breakout that we provide that's on our website, Asia. We don't usually break out China but Asia was flattish. The declines were largely in the Americas and to a larger extent, in Europe. And I think China and Asia on current basis is more constructive. The weakness is predominantly in the Americas and Europe. And I think that is, to some extent, consistent with if you look at some of the PMI reports and where the manufacturing economy is that just this morning, the U.S. PMI came out last month, the European PMI came out. This is not the first month, there's been many, many months over which that weakness has been playing out. And I think China was there earlier on as were other parts of Asia. Some of that they have worked out. So, more stability and strength on a relative basis than the Europe and Americas regions.
Operator: Next question, Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg: Ganesh, one of your peers last week talked about customers sort of ordering hand to mouth and potentially even holding too low inventory due to working capital constraints and so on and so forth. Are you seeing that with some of your customers and maybe especially on the industrial side because that's certainly a concerning thing and it certainly may reflect the very low terms orders that you are getting or the very low backlog visibility that you are getting?
Ganesh Moorthy: No, that is absolutely happening at many, many customers. And I think they have, in some cases, low visibility into their own business as well. So they're reflecting that. Given that there's plenty of capacity and short lead times, right? There's really no reason for them to try to get backlog ahead of time. At some point, that will change and it will correct itself. But yes, the -- what is reflected in the green shoots we talked about when we said we're getting expedite orders where new orders are being placed with short cycle expectation and prior orders that were placed are being pulled in. Those are all reflective of people who are more conservative in how they place orders and then recognizing they need it parts sooner. At some point, that will catch up on itself. It's still early but that's how these things usually correct is people tend to go too low and run out of inventory, any strengthening in the business starts to create some urgency for orders that becomes the whole expedite chase. We saw that back in other cycles as well. But that is something we're watching. We're still in the early innings of how that up cycle will play out.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. And related to that, I mean, can you comment on how much terms you need at this point and maybe compare that with previous cycle?
Ganesh Moorthy: So we don't typically break that out. I think maybe you want to give some historical perspective on where they're at.
Eric Bjornholt: So I mean, it is not unusual for us to enter a quarter needing 30%, 40% turns. And with short lead times, we've been able to do that historically now. We're coming off a period up to the last couple of quarters where we were fully booked entering a quarter. So it's definitely a large change for us from what we've seen over the last 2.5 years. But there's a significant amount of terms that we need to take and we've kind of been signaling that to the marketplace that with short lead times that is not out of outside of what we would expect it to be. And customers are managing their balance sheet and know that we can get them inventory quickly.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen.
Joshua Buchalter: Congratulations to Steve in the next step in an incredible career. To start, I was hoping maybe you provide some more color on what's baked into your assumptions for the September quarter guidance. I know it's difficult but is there any way maybe you can give us on a relative basis. Do you -- how much do you expect to be under-shipping demand in the September quarter? Is that level going down versus June. Do you feel like you're close to shipping to end demand and demand just weak? I'd just be curious to hear any granularity you can give us on what you're seeing at inventory levels, both in the channel what your downstream -- and at your downstream customers.
Ganesh Moorthy: So a lot of questions there and I think there's a lot of information that is really not readily available. Clearly, as Eric mentioned, the distribution inventory in absolute terms has been coming down. It's the third consecutive quarter where we brought down distribution. So that is draining. Where is true consumption at - I think that's a $64 million question that I'm not completely sure we know where that is. Anecdotally, when I visit customers and I try to understand where is their business and I try to compare it to where is our business, right? Where is our business. Customer business is down more in the 5%, 10%, 15% year-over-year kind of that level. We're obviously down in the mid-40s, maybe high 40s with the guidance and. So that delta is what you should expect that in time, as inventory drains will get closed with a recovery in our business even when the macro is still weak. But the customers don't really report out inventory to us. We can glean information based on are they placing orders? Are they expediting orders? What are they seeing? And in those patterns, you can begin to form conclusions for a given customer. We have 100,000 customers. It's awfully hard to integrate that. And then from an end market perspective, as we mentioned, both industrial and automotive are both large pieces of our business and where we see the largest weaknesses as well.
Joshua Buchalter: Understood. And I mean, it doesn't really seem like it from the gross margin numbers you're putting up. But anything changed as a digestion extends on the pricing front? And in particular, like one of your larger peers, I think, called out some pricing pressure and weakness in general purpose microcontrollers. Are you observing any of that?
Ganesh Moorthy: So there's no pricing pressure on the immediate products we are shipping last quarter or this quarter. And there's always the fringes some of that. But what really takes place is our new designs, all participants who are trying to win a design are going to put their best foot forward which often is their newest and most cost-effective products and are going to be as aggressive as they can be with consistent within their model for that. That is, in fact, happening. And -- but that is always how business has been conducted. And I'm sure there may be a little extra of that when people see the environment is weak. But pricing, in general, is a more strategic exercise both for us and for customers for whom they're making decisions on a platform for multi-years. And price is not the only reason someone makes a decision. It's really value. And it's what else do we bring besides price that brings the overall value equation to match what the customer is willing to accept.
Operator: Next question Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: As you guys mentioned other of your peers in the embedded market, MCU and analog have seen sort of this broad pickup in China back in May, at our conference. I think you did talk about seeing improvements in sell-through by your China [ph] customers. It looks like, again, as you guys mentioned, this was reflected in your Asia sales which were flat sequentially. Did Asia [ph] sell-through actually grow sequentially in June? And during the September quarter, would you anticipate China and the Asia region revenues this quarter to outperform Europe and North America again?
Eric Bjornholt: We don't break out the details of sell-through any longer, right. We provided some information over the last couple of quarters of the amount that sell-through exceeded sell-in. That amount was $85 million roughly in the June quarter and about $125 million in the March quarter. I will just say that China was really the first to go into this. This is similar to Ganesh's comments earlier. And we wouldn't be surprised if they were the first to come out. The June quarter is a little bit hard to judge because the March quarter has a Chinese New Year. So there's just more shipping days, right? And so you kind of have to look effectively what's happening on a daily basis. But I would say China is our least weak market at this point in time. And I know that doesn't sound great but Americas and Europe are definitely hurting more so at this point in time than what we're seeing out of the Far East.
Ganesh Moorthy: One of the difference in this cycle is we have typically viewed sell-through as a measure of the consumption, the economic conditions have changed. What we're also seeing is there is inventory sometimes downstream. So a great example, if you take automotive, right, if you look at automotive showrooms, particularly in the U.S. where they have inventory, have substantially more inventory today than they did a year ago or 2 years ago. So inventory sometimes is not just what the channel has but also what is downstream from them. And all those play into the final equation of how does the destocking take place. And I think that has been one of the reasons why it has been slower than what most of us have expected. But as every month goes by, it continues to lower the level of water. And I think that just sets the conditions up for when this will revert back and change to those direction.
Harlan Sur: I appreciate the color there. Obviously, in this kind of environment that you just described, there is a lot of in orders. I appreciate that. But is the team seeing a pickup in cancellations pushouts and rescheduling or is that still at relatively low levels.
Ganesh Moorthy: No, that has been on a decline continues to be -- that's one of the green shoots that continues is that new bookings are continuing not as fast as we would like and the cancellations and pushouts are decreasing. So those are good signs.
Operator: Next question, Chris Danely with Citibank.
Chris Danely: I guess just from a broader perspective, so you're seeing some green shoots but the revenue decline is getting incrementally worse. So exactly how is that happening? And then when the customers come to you guys, are they saying that it's more their demand trends are a little worse than expected? Or are they just like found too much inventory? Or is it some combination of both? Maybe just take us into the machinations of the quarter of the business?
Ganesh Moorthy: If you look at the end markets, we have a large exposure to industrial and automotive. And clearly, there is more clean-up there. That's also where when you look at broader macro trends, what is happening with the PMI, what is being reflected in that. I mean I think U.S. has had of 21 months in a row where the PMI has been weak. Europe, I think, is closer to 24 months. So all of that is just playing itself out into lack of confidence in knowing what and when their business will change, lack of confidence in placing orders soon enough. And so at some point, this will all reverse. We just don't have enough visibility to be able to say, "Hey, here's how it is and here's when it is. And -- but I don't have more than that. We call it the way we're seeing it. And right now, I think there's lack of confidence reflected in the backlog being low and the orders being placed on shorter cycles than what they would historically have done. And you add all that up, is what we have in our guidance.
Chris Danely: Sure. And then before I ask my follow-up, I just want to say that Steve, you are a true icon in the industry, especially for those of us that have been around for a long time. And we really appreciated your candor and your honesty over the years; I really mean that. And as my follow-up, just in terms of your 2 bigger end markets, automotive versus industrial, any qualitative or quantitative comments on which is worse or which is better and why on a relative basis?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. I don't know about the why but I can tell you, I think in general, anecdotally, I would say industrial feels worse and it's just been consistent with -- I think automotive has a bit of it which is inventory but also a bit of it which is people are still buying cars and it's just flowing through that inventory. But I would say on a relative basis that would be my best guess.
Operator: Next question, Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.
Harsh Kumar: Yes. Let me start off. Steve, congratulations. I've enjoyed working with you for all these, I guess, over a decade now. And hopefully, we'll still get to hear your voice on at least some of the calls. Appreciate it. Steve, all the holes that we put in with you and you're honestly as somebody else said earlier. I had a question. Let me start off with the product question. Could you just help us understand what kind of end markets you might be able to address with a 64-bit microcontroller -- and I think you mentioned that the software that will be used on 64 bit is also the same over 8 to 64 and also your FPGA line. Is that actually correct? And how important is that?
Ganesh Moorthy: So firstly, it isn't the software that is common. It's all the development tools and the related ecosystem of what we need to do. But yes, so they all come under what is a Microchip branded set of ecosystem and tools. We call it MP lab. And all of that is set up in such a way that once you get used to that environment, you can easily move around, you can port things between the different products and you can start on a bit processor and move to a 64-bit processor or vice versa as the case might be. The -- there is a significant expansion that is at the higher performance end of where this processing takes place. And so this is more compute intensive. It's in places which can be in factory automation, it's envision. That machine vision. It's an AI at the edge. And so it's a continuum of where we were on microprocessors with 32-bit but now higher end from there where we couldn't reach before with the products that we had and also, in some cases, opening up some places where perhaps people would not have considered us because they didn't see a common road map that they could get to from starting at one end of what we had in 32-bit and moving into the other end of 64 bit. So this is going to be done over multiple years, we'll have a broad set of portfolio of products, a family of products that are going to be needed. But clearly, it opens up a meaningful amount of new total available market to us. And by our estimates, there's about $3 billion to $4 billion of total available market on the 32-bit loan. By the time you add the 64 bits, it almost doubled that to about $6 billion.
Harsh Kumar: Got it. And maybe for my follow-up, I wanted to ask you sort of talked about industrial versus automotive but maybe you could give us some more color on which other end markets outside of data center are acting better. And perhaps some that are not acting so well outside of industrial.
Ganesh Moorthy: There's nothing that is acting better so to speak. Aerospace and defense for various reasons. It's stable. There are pockets of commercial aviation that for the well-known issues are there space tends to be a very lumpy business for us quarter-to-quarter. Defense is strong for reasons that you can read in the news as well. But I don't have any other end market out as being particularly noteworthy.
Operator: Next question, Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.
Unidentified Analyst: Nick Doyle [ph] on for Quinn. Just one question kind of talking about the other side of -- the only place that's positive, you talked about a broadening of data center growth in the September quarter. Can you just elaborate what's coming from? Is it from the general purpose side, the power connectivity, anything specific you can call out?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. So the data center infrastructure which is kind of where a lot of the business was before the AI wave and the accelerated computing way I came about as that happened, there was some amount of CapEx at many places that moved primarily to the accelerated computing. And we had our share of that with where we were designed in. Now what we're seeing is some of that a and it can be in the back plane, the citing the power supplies, it can be in the storage networks, a number of different areas that all need at some point, the data center investment as well. And all of that plays into the data center solutions that we bring. So the AI or the accelerated computing piece is going well. It's just other parts of data center are doing better at this point. Yes. And some of that, you can see also reflected in the CapEx announcements that have been made by some of the data center players out there.
Operator: Next question, Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities.
Craig Ellis: Steve, let me just start off by saying thanks for all the insights over the years, I learned a tremendous amount from you and really appreciate all your help. Moving on to questions, Ganesh, I wanted to go back to the point you made in prepared commentary about the significant reengagement from customers and design in activity as we got through the supply chain crisis. As you look at how that's manifested across Microchip's business, can you comment a little bit for the unnotable trends? And from when those engagements result in design or a design win that's going to go to protect production, how should investors think about the gestation period. So when do we begin to see the benefit of this renewed more vibrant engagement that you're seeing from your customers?
Ganesh Moorthy: So our historical design cycles have been in the 12 to 24 months range. Some of them are a little longer, so maybe it shorter. But for the most part, it's in that 12 to 24 months range. And so you would begin to see a lot of this in the next 12 months because we are about 12 months into that process. Now keep in mind that there are a couple of other forces that will make certain adjustments to it. One is when customers have inventory, they will also look to use their inventory and perhaps be a little more of the older generation until they can burn through that inventory before they shift to the newer generation of whatever they build. Second, if the slowdown in the macro persists for some time, historically, what we mean is customers tend to want to delay some of the launch because there's upfront costs associated with the marketing activities there, building of inventory, stocking of channels and all of that. And so there are many things at play here. But it should, in the next 1, 2, 3 years, create a surge of activity from all the work that has been started since about a year ago and it's continuing and will continue. And that surge has the benefit of both Microchip's approach on maximizing the total system solutions. And we do measure that internally, how we look at how many products for Microchip are getting attached to these new designs and how well it attaches to the fastest growing parts of the market. So I think there's a lot coming in the next 1, 2, 3 years from design in activity over the last year, plus the design-in activities that are still continuing over the next 1 or 2 years.
Craig Ellis: That's really helpful. And then for the follow-up 1 for Eric. Eric, it's clear you're able to keep CapEx pretty low over the next 2 to 4 quarters. I wanted to understand the interplay of that with low foundry utilization that we're seeing in potentially attractive pricing. At the margin, does the current foundry environment with low utilization give you an opportunity to do a little bit more externally or as you look at the mix of internal and external production, are you interested in continuing with the mix that you've had in driving that forward.
Eric Bjornholt: I would say the mix that we have is pretty fixed, right? Typically, a product is either designed on a process technology in one of our own factories or an outsourced partners process. There are limited cases where we have capabilities to do something both externally and internally on the fab side. So I think that mix is going to stay about where it's at. We continue to do some things with technologies that we own to bring them in-house but we've got this roughly 40% in rental 60% external split for foundry. And I think that will likely stay about that for the coming years.
Ganesh Moorthy: And where we have opportunities of technologies that can run both inside and outside. And we have done some of the work over the last 2, 3 years towards that. It is far more favorable to load an underloaded internal factory for almost all cases that I can think of, than it is to say, let's continue to underload the internal factory and load more at the foundry.
Operator: Next question, Janet Ramkissoon with Quadra Capital.
Janet Ramkissoon: First, Steve, thanks very much for a nice ride. All these decades and for all you've done for Microchip long-term shareholders. A lot of my questions have been asked.
Steve Sanghi: Janet, I met you 34 years ago when I was raising private financing at a $10 million market cap. Fast-forward 34 years with a $45 billion market cap, you're still there [ph]. So staying there I'm ready to go kick four of my grandkids. Kick them around [ph].
Janet Ramkissoon: I still hold some of that stock, Steve. Thank you for convincing me then to -- with this. So just a couple of little ones, if I may. 64-bit marketplace. Can you give us a sense or any color on what the early design win activity is looking like? And the second question is that you said that June, May was fattish June was weak. Any additional color on how July progressed relative to June and May.
Ganesh Moorthy: So, I think the -- I said May was flattish. June actually was -- is -- in terms of plans was up from there. The July numbers are just coming together, I would say, is flattish where it was. So month-to-month, these things don't matter as much. We just need to look at it kind of on a quarterly bucket in terms of where it's at. And in a stutter step, it is heading in the right direction, just not consistent month-to-month and not at the pace that we want to on a quarter-to-quarter basis. On your 64-bit question, it's early days. So it's too early to have design wins but we have lots of early adopters. These would be customers who are interested, want to have the product samples and the tools have an idea of a design that they want to pursue are in detailed discussions with our field and technical teams because they see an opportunity to take advantage of what the 64-bit product lines have. And so it's optimistic early days but still early days.
Janet Ramkissoon: Just one little thing. If history repeats itself, once you start producing the 64-bit chips, the margins on those new products should really move up the ramp quite a bit faster. Well, they would certainly be faster than the 32-bit would assume given the markets that you're targeting. Is that a fair assumption?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's a little early for that. Typically, the processor or controller margins have all been within a narrow range between them. I think to some extent, as we find the specific applications we'll look at that. And we want to look at margin not just on that 1 chip alone. We want to look at how is it with the entire portfolio that attached to that 64 bed. And so the value for us is not just the 1 chip but it's really the entire total system solutions that we can bring to that customer.
Operator: I would like to turn the floor over to Ganesh for closing remarks.
Ganesh Moorthy: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for coming in and spending some time with us. And we look forward to meeting many of you in the coming weeks through the conferences and other meetings that are being set up. So thank you. This concludes this call.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-05-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Microchip Q4 of Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Eric Bjornholt, Senior Vice President and CFO. Thank you, Eric. You may begin.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events and results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC, that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip’s President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip’s Executive Chair; Rich Simoncic, Microchip’s COO, and Sajid Daudi, Microchip’s Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the investor relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis which is based on expenses, prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation, and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliations on our website. Net sales in the March quarter were $1.326 billion, which was down 24.9% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 60.3%, including capacity under utilization charges of $32 million. Operating expenses were at 27.4%, and operating income was 32.9%. Although our operating income was better than the midpoint of our guidance, our cash taxes came in higher than forecasted. Non-GAAP net income was $310.3 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.57 and at the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis in the March quarter, gross margins were 59.6%. Total operating expenses were $536.4 million and included acquisition and tangible amortization of $151.2 million, special income of $16.9 million, which was primarily driven by the settlement of an unclaimed property audit at a value that was less than what we had accrued for. Share-based compensation of $37.4 million and $1.1 million of other expenses. GAAP net income was $154.7 million resulting in $0.28 in diluted earnings per share. For fiscal year 2024, net sales were $7.634 billion and were down 9.5% from net sales in fiscal year 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 65.8%, operating expenses were 22% of sales, and operating income was 43.9% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $2.698 billion, and EPS was $4.92 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 65.4%, operating expenses were 31.8% of sales, and operating income was 33.7% of sales. Net income was $1.907 billion and EPS was $3.48 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 18.8% in the March quarter and 14.5% for fiscal year 2024. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2025 is expected to be about 13%, which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchip’s non-GAAP tax rate in future periods. Our inventory balance at March 31st, 2024 was $1.316 billion. We had 224 days of inventory at the end of the March quarter, which was up 39 days from the prior quarter's level and in-line with our expectation, giving the difficult revenue quarter we experienced. At the midpoint of our June 2024 quarter guidance, we would expect inventory dollars to be up modestly and days of inventory to increase based on the lower cost of goods sold, driven by the depressed revenue levels at which we believe is the low point of the current cycle for Microchip. We also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end-of-life by our supply chain partners, and these last time buys represented 14 days of inventory at the end of March. Inventory at our distributors -- in the March quarter were at 41 days, which was up 4 days from the prior quarter's level. Distribution took down their inventory in the March quarter as distribution sell-through was about $125 million higher than distribution sell-in. The inventory days increased as this is reflective of the much lower cost of sales for Microchip in the March quarter that is used in this calculation. Our cash flow from operating activities was $430 million in the March quarter. Our adjusted pre-cash flow was $389.9 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $319.7 million. Our total debt increased by $312 million in the March quarter, and our net debt increased by $273.3 million. Our adjusted EBITDA in the March quarter was $503 million and 37.9% of sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $3.623 billion, and our net debt adjusted EBITDA was 1.57 at March 31, 2024, up from 1.45 at March 31, 2023. Capital expenditures were $40.1 million in the March quarter and $285.1 million for fiscal year 2024. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2025 is about $175 million. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $45.8 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter, as well as our guidance for the June quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy : Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter results were consistent with our guidance with net sales down 24.9% sequentially and down 40.6% from the year ago quarter. As we endured through a major inventory correction. Non-GAAP gross margin came in as expected at 60.3% and non-GAAP operating margin was better than expected at 32.9% due to the strong expense control programs we had in place. However, as Eric mentioned, our tax rate was higher than expected and as a result our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS only met expectations at $0.57 per share. Our revenue decline resulted in March quarter EBITDA dropping and as a result our net leverage ratio rose to 1.57x. We expect our net leverage to rise modestly for a few quarters, as trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA drops when replacing stronger prior year quarters, with weaker current year quarters. However, our cash generation capability remains strong and we are committed to our capital return plan. Our capital return to shareholders in the June quarter will increase to 87.5% of our March quarter adjusted free cash flow as we continue on our path to return 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter of calendar year 2025. Reflecting on our fiscal year 2024 results, it was a roller coaster year with a positive start that was followed by a major inventory correction. As compared to fiscal year 2023, revenue declined 9.5% to $7.6 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin was resilient at 43.9% as we took the actions required to respond to the major inventory correction. Capital return to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks in fiscal 2024 was $1.89 billion, representing a 15.4% growth as compared to fiscal year 2023. My thanks to our worldwide team for their support, hard work, and diligence as we navigate a difficult environment and focus on actions that we believe position us well to thrive in the long-term. Taking a look at our fiscal year 2024 net sales from a product line perspective, our mixed-signal microcontroller net sales were down 10.2% and represented 56% of Microchip's overall revenue. Our analog net sales were down 15.2% and represented 26.4% of Microchip's overall revenue. While we don't normally break out our FPGA product line results, it is noteworthy that our fiscal year 2024 FPGA revenue exceeded $679 million and set another record. FPGA revenue grew over 22% as compared to fiscal 2023 and delivered operating margins of a north of corporate average. We deliver market-leading mid-range FPGA solutions with best-in-class low power, reliability, and security, and are especially well-suited for the fast emerging opportunities around artificial intelligence at the edge. Our overall FPGA design win momentum is strong across multiple end markets. A few other product line notes of significance. Early in April, we closed our acquisition of Seoul Korea-based VSI, an ADAS and Digital Cockpit Connectivity Pioneer, to extend our Automotive Networking Market leadership. This acquisition adds Automotive SerDes Alliance Motion Link technology, otherwise known as ASA-ML, to Microchip's broad Ethernet and PCIe automotive networking portfolio to enable next generation software defined vehicles. With the anticipated increase in the adoption of advanced camera-based driver assistance systems, in-cabin monitoring, safety and convenience features, and multi-screen digital cockpits for next-generation software-defined vehicles, there is a growing requirement for more highly asymmetric raw data and video links and higher bandwidths, which the ASA Motion Link Open Standard supports. Also last month, we closed our acquisition of Neuronix AI Labs, whose innovative software technology enhances AI-enabled intelligent edge solutions and increases neural networking capabilities. This technology expands our capabilities for power-efficient AI-enabled edge solutions deployed on FPGAs. Neuronix AI Labs provides neural network sparsity optimization technology that enables the reduction in power, size, and calculation for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation while maintaining high accuracy. Finally, in July, we expect to announce our entry into the 64-bit embedded microprocessor market with a suite of products, development tools, and other support requirements to address high-performance embedded processing applications, including AI-enabled edge solutions. This will extend our strong 32-bit embedded microprocessor portfolio to higher performance and increased capabilities, while preserving Microchip's historically strong ecosystem of leading development tools to make adoption easy for embedded system design engineers. Microchip is the only company to offer the widest embedded control and processing platform from 8-bit to 64-bit, as well as FPGAs, with a common development tool ecosystem that's empowering customers to innovate and reuse their work across a wide spectrum of markets and applications. Now for some color on the March quarter and the general business environment. All regions of the world and most of our end-markets, with the exception of aerospace and defense and the artificial intelligence subset of data centers were weak. We believe that our product shipments were significantly lower than the end-market consumption of our products as our distribution channels drained inventory during the quarter. Our broad base of customers continued to lower their inventory and adjust their business plans in the midst of a weak macro environment and an uncertain outlook. With no major supply constraints, coupled with very short lead times and a weak macro environment, we believe that as inventory destocking, as well as reduction in target inventory levels that is underway at multiple levels, that our direct customers and distributors buy from us, our indirect customers who buy through our distributors, and in some cases our customers' customers. We are however, also seeing early signs of green shoots in our business. First, the level of requests to cancellations and push-outs has started to subside. Second, our bookings have started to pick up, albeit from low levels. February bookings were the highest in eight months. March bookings were the highest in all of fiscal 2024, and April bookings were higher than March. Third, the new bookings are aging over a shorter period of time. And fourth, the number of expedites and shipment pull-in requests are growing. Collectively, these green shoots, we believe, are pointing to the formation of a bottom. Our average lead times continue to be eight weeks or less. During a period of business uncertainty, we believe short lead times are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed with us. However, the significant reduction in lead time is also resulting in reduced near-term visibility for our business. Given the severity of the inventory correction, our factories around the world are running at lower utilization rates. And our pre-major fabs will take another two-week shutdown in the June quarter in order to help control the growth of inventory. Our internal capacity expansion actions remain paused. We expect our capital investments in fiscal year 2025 will be low, even as we prepare for the long-term growth of our business. On the CHIPS Act front, we have nothing new to report. The CHIPS office has completed their diligence for the grants we are seeking, and we are working towards an agreement. At this stage of a major inventory correction, we believe that the days of inventory metric, whether for Microchip or for our distributors, can be deceptive, as this is a backward-looking indicator measuring off of the baseline that is well below where we believe end-market consumption is at. For inventory planning, we are, therefore focused on where we believe consumption is running and will likely run in the coming quarters. We continue to work with our distribution partners to attempt to find the right balance of inventory required to serve their customers, manage through their cash flow requirements and be positioned for the eventual strengthening of business conditions. The operating expense reduction efforts we implemented last quarter, including broad-based salary sacrifices are continuous this quarter. The shutdown for manufacturing team members and pay cuts for non-manufacturing team members are consistent with our long-standing culture of shared sacrifices and down cycles and shared rewards and up cycles. Our culture of shared sacrifice protects our valuable employees from layoffs, helps enable us to support customers and maintain our design win momentum, helps ensure that manufacturing capacity can be turned on quickly as business conditions strengthen and helps enable our product development teams to maintain their pace of new solution introductions. Now let's get into the guidance for the June quarter. While we see a number of green shoots in our business indicators, we still need turns orders within the quarter to meet our guidance. Operating in a high turns environment has historically been normal for Microchip. It is just not a position we have found ourselves in over the last few years due to supply-constrained high backlog environment, we and the industry experience. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the June quarter to be between $1.22 billion and $1.26 billion. We believe that the June 2024 quarter marks the bottom of the cycle for Microchip and that our business will return to sequential revenue growth in the September 2024 quarter. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59% and 61% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 28.25% and 28.75% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 30.25% and 32.75% of sales, and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.48 and $0.56. We believe that the fundamental characteristics of growth, profitability and cash generation of our business remain intact. We are confident that our solutions remain the engine of innovation for the applications and end markets we serve. Our focus on total system solutions and key market megatrends continue to fuel strong design win momentum, which we expect will drive above-market long-term growth. We remain committed to executing our Microchip 3.0 strategic imperatives, which we believe will deliver sustained results and substantial shareholder value. Last but not least a month ago, we appointed Rich Simoncic as Chief Operating Officer. Rich is a Microchip Lifer who has been with us for 35 years in many different capacities, which has been expanding his role over the last few years, and he and I will jointly lead the Microchip global enterprise so that we can apply our combined leadership capacity to engage the opportunities and challenges that are ahead of us. With that, let me pass it back on to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to provide you with a further update on our cash return strategy. The Board of Directors approved an increase in the dividend of 18% from the year ago quarter to a record [$0.452] (ph) per share. During the last quarter, we purchased a record $387.4 million of our stock in the open-market. We also paid out a record $242.5 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was a record $629.9 million. This amount was 82.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $763.4 million during the December 2023 quarter. Our net leverage at the end of March 2024 was 1.57 times. Ever since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned a total of $4.23 billion to shareholders through March 31, 2024, by a combination of dividends and share buybacks. During this period, our share buyback in the open market was approximately 30.4 million shares, representing approximately 5.7% of our shares outstanding. In the current June quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow level from the March quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes amounts we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments, these payments are refundable when purchase commitments are fulfilled. Our adjusted free cash flow for the March quarter was $389.9 million, so our target return to shareholders would be 87.5% or $341.2 million of that amount. However, as Ganesh mentioned, we did complete two small acquisitions in this June quarter. So we are reducing our share buyback amount to reflect the cash outlay for those deals. Thus, in the June quarter, our cash return to shareholders is expected to be $315.3 million, out of which dividends are expected to be approximately $243 million and our expected stock buyback will be approximately $72.3 million. Going forward, we plan to continue to increase our adjusted free cash flow to return to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. They will take three more quarters, and we expect that dividends over time will represent approximately 50% of our cash returns. With that, operator will you please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Now we’ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Ganesh, you were suggesting June to be the bottom-line for September to grow sequentially because of green shoots. But to be fair, green shoots are suggested on the last call also. So what's the difference between the last call and this call and if you could help us maybe quantify what has been maybe the base of bookings increase year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter so far, so we can get sense for a base of recovery into September, and then maybe if I could also ask Eric on a related note is, 60% also the trough for gross margin, if June is the bottom, does it also mean 60% is the trough for gross margins? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Great. Thank you, Vivek. I don't think we mentioned green shoots at the last earnings call, but we did say that one of our banking sessions that we were at. And that was the first time we began to see it was in the March time frame. And the momentum is picking up, right as we go through March and April and May. I mentioned what the bookings we are doing on a relative basis over that time. We can see how many more people are asking for pull-ins and expedites and all of that. So it's a qualitative view looking at how we integrate the last two or three months of where momentum is coming in, where the customer feedback is coming in that reflects our view that the June quarter is the bottom and September quarter is growth.
Eric Bjornholt: And then the follow-up question for me on that was on gross margin. And would I expect if June is the trough in revenue if gross margin would bottom-out. And I believe that to be the case. I mean, obviously, we haven't given guidance yet, and there's factors that apply to that, that we don't know yet in terms of product mix and where we'll be running our factories. But I think that we are bouncing along the bottom on gross margin.
Vivek Arya: Great. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I guess the question is if there's any difference that you are seeing from any of the different end-markets? I mean, you talked about some of the booking stabilization improvement that you've seen. How would you characterize that among the different end markets?
Ganesh Moorthy: I don't -- on the stabilization, I can't really point to a particular end market or doing better or not. I said in the aggregate, aerospace and defense and the AI segment of data center are both doing well. And so that part is pulling it up. On the others, there can be some industrial customers, who are still seeing weakness, others who are beginning to see the bottom and trying to come back in with rush orders that goes into the other end markets as well. So no particular end market trend that is distinguishable on the bottoming out of where their inventories are.
Chris Caso: Thanks. As a follow-up, Eric you talked about perhaps if still things go well, June the trough and then June is likely the bottom for gross margins as well. As you go forward, as we pull our way out of this, what do you think would be the trajectory of gross margins? And I guess I asked that taking consideration the fact that your internal inventory is still high. So how would we think about gross margins in the context of recovery as you have to bring your own inventories down to normal?
Eric Bjornholt: So it does depend on the revenue trajectory and then how we would run our factories to respond to that. And so it's not a question that I can 100% answer today. But our cost structures are still in good shape. Average selling prices are absolutely hanging in there. So with that, we have confidence in our long-term model and our ability to get back there, but the trajectory and how we get there is going to very much be revenue dependent, which will drive certain actions to increase output from our factories. So I know that's not specifically answering your question, but I think that's the best we can do right now.
Chris Caso: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about channel sell-through dynamics from your global distributors? In March, you mentioned sell-through $125 million higher versus sell-in. Is that a similar delta here in the June quarter? And if excess inventories at end customer of distributors are coming down, I would assume that distribution sell-through is starting to grow. Are you seeing that this quarter? And is this maybe what's also giving you confidence that June is the bottom?
Ganesh Moorthy: So Harlan, thanks for the question. The level of inventory that is past what our distributors had that has been with our customers is not always visible to us. I think we can get some sense of that from what the distribution sell-through is. But there is also a second factor, which is some of those customers are also reducing the months of inventory they want to carry. So it's a multipronged answer to it. But what we can see is that distribution is part of the placing of additional orders on us. So they are seeing how they are managing their end customers, their inventory and placing incremental orders on us. So that must have some relevance to how they're viewing things, but I don't have a definitive answer on where sell-through is going to end up versus sell-in here in the June quarter, at least not at this time.
Harlan Sur: Thank you for that. And then just a quick follow-up. So direct customer shipments were almost 30% -- were down almost 30% sequentially, while [these shipments were] (ph) only down 20% sequentially in March. Does that suggest that excess inventories are maybe a bit more pronounced at your direct customers? And if your lead times are sub-eight weeks, you guys only have visibility through the end of this quarter. So what gives the Microchip team confidence that shipments to direct customers post June will be growing sequentially as you aren't looking beyond that and you don't really have visibility into their sell-through dynamics?
Ganesh Moorthy: So we know and customers are placing backlog into the September quarter, into the December quarter. So there's not a single answer that everybody is following. And we can see that as the bookings are rising, they are placing them into the next three months to six months on a more predominant basis. So that level of where the momentum is coming in or how backlog is coming in is what gives us a sense of where the bottom is and how things are going to be as we into the September and December quarters.
Harlan Sur: Thanks Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Gary Mobley: Hi guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. I know you guys communicated that you held the OpEx lower than expected. And I think it's today, what -- $355 million on a non-GAAP basis. My question is, how long can you hold that down? And is there any claw-back provisions for the lost wages during this temporary salary cut? And I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should think about the OpEx increasing as revenue increase?
Eric Bjornholt: I'll start with the response and Ganesh can add to it if he wants to. So there is not a clawback in terms of what we're doing from a salary sacrifice for our employees. We have the shared sacrifice share reward program. And in the past, when we have implemented something like this that has worked out well for our employees that we keep everybody working on the things that are important to drive the revenue growth as the cycle turns upward and we've gained market share through that. And so we've had great financial results coming out of it and then been able to share those rewards with employees through higher bonuses and taking away the pay cuts at the appropriate time. So we are going to have to see how this plays out from a top-line revenue perspective. It would be my perspective that we will achieve the same types of results this go around with the actions that we've taken, but there's no promise to employees that they're going to get this money back. There's no retroactive claw-back that would be implemented.
Ganesh Moorthy: This is a part of our culture that is not always as easily appreciable from an investor community. We have 98% of employees around the world that are participating in this voluntary. We have another 700 employees who have volunteered for a higher salary reduction than what we have requested from them. It's very difficult to quantify how powerful culture plays a role in these type of difficult situations and how much that the employees that are part of the solution. And of course, they are part of the shared rewards that come up as we get into better times as well. So this is very much of a program that has worked many times in the past and is another time we're applying it, and we expect it to be successful.
Eric Bjornholt: I think the other thing that I'd add is we know this is difficult for employees. The inflation still exists, and this is a challenge for employees. So it is not that we want to keep these in place. But at the time, with where we're guiding revenue for the current quarter of revenue and earnings it's appropriate. And we hope that we can restore these things back to normal salary levels as soon as possible.
Gary Mobley: Thank you for that color. This is my follow-up, I wanted to perhaps strike a more positive chord and ask about design win metrics for the fiscal year. I don’t know if you have those stats on handy with you, but maybe if you can just give us some qualitative or quantitative measure of the lifetime value of the design wins.
Ganesh Moorthy: So we don't usually break that out and we have slightly different ways in which we look at this. What we do constantly look at is how is the design pipeline progressing. And in the course of 2023 in addition to all the work that we did, we also saw customers shifting their priorities from doing triage for some of the shortages that they were running into bringing back the innovation program that they had put on hold. And so if you put all of that together, the design win pipeline is strong. There’s a lot more design in activity in the last 12 months than there was in the prior 12 months, just simply because customer bandwidth was there to be able to run the development program that they were progressing with.
Gary Mobley : Thanks Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy : Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Carlos Coronado with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi, it's Tim on. So Ganesh, can you give us a sense of book-to-bill. It sounds like it was below one for March, but I just wanted to confirm that. And I know that you did say that orders are getting better month by month. But is the message that you think book-to-bill could be above one for the June quarter. So I'm just wondering if you can talk to book-to-bill? Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: So book-to-bill was below 1. However, book-to-bill has never been an indicator for us of where the business is going as much as an indicator of where our lead times are. During the 2021, 2022 shortages, we had book-to-bill in many, many multiples of where they were at, reflecting the long lead times. Right now with short lead times that we have, we expect book-to-bill will be lower. But the bookings are rising, and I can't quite tell what May and June are going to complete. So I don't have a thing – but I -- we don't really look at book-to-bill as necessarily an indicator of where the growth is going to be. It's more a reflection of as lead times get short, people replace the booking consistent with the shorter lead times.
Timothy Arcuri: Got it. Okay. And then, Eric, one for you. So inventory was a little higher coming out of March then -- and I think some of us thought it would be. Can you talk about loadings in the factory and sort of how you're thinking about loadings into June? Are you just kind of drawing the line understand where you plan to bring down inventory on the balance sheet in June? And yes, just kind of talk about that and its impact on gross margin. Thanks.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. So I'm honestly not quite sure where The Street had us modeled. We had talked about in our last conference call that inventory days are expected to be between about 225 to 230 days at the midpoint. We came in at 224. So I think we kind of deliver on what we told The Street we were going to do. In terms of utilization in the current quarter, we have been having some attrition in our factories. And because of that, we can start less wafers on a monthly basis than we can because we have a fewer number of employees. But it's -- in the big picture of things relatively modest. I don't think utilization will be significantly different than it was in the March quarter, maybe just modestly lower.
Timothy Arcuri: Well, thank you Eric. Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt : Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. Let me move on from cyclical questions. And I have a question on 64-bit microcontrollers. You also had an AI acquisition in the quarter. Just trying to understand, Ganesh, your conversations with customers, we hear AI at the edge a lot, but it's hard for us to get true visibility on that. So -- when will Edge AI become a much more meaningful part of your revenues, what you think?
Ganesh Moorthy: Our target markets for Edge AI predominantly in industrial, smaller extent, automotive, some in medical. The medical segment of industrial factory automation, all that. So they are designs in progress and they've been taking place over the last six months to 12 months. They probably will just state over 24 to 30 months of time. So it's in that time. There's some of it small amounts that are already taking place, but I think it becomes a more and more meaningful part as time goes on. And each of these either product line announcement or some of the acquisitions, which give us specific technologies, just accelerate where those designs can go and how our solutions can be differentiated from others providing similar solutions.
Tore Svanberg: Great. And as my follow-up, you said that you're basically shipping below consumption. You're about $1 billion from your trough. Obviously, you're running inventory at a certain level. So you must have some idea where the consumption is. Is that a number you could share with us?
Ganesh Moorthy: Not with any level of precision. I think any form of a take a four quarter revenue divided by 4 starts to get you into the ballpark. But even that is unclear, right? So I think that number will get clearer as people begin to book and buy at a level that they need to, excluding any quote just to get back to consumption. But there's not an easy way to make that number determinable. It's clearly between where our peak a year ago was in the June quarter to where you're seeing the guidance for this quarter.
Tore Svanberg: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Toshiya Hari: Hi good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I had two quick ones. First, on inventory, maybe for Eric. So how should we think about inventory management through cycle or longer term? I know you've got strategic inventory. I know you want to better service your customers on the way up. But when you think 12 months out, 18 months out, whether be in dollars or days, what are you managing the business to? And then quick follow-up on pricing. I think you mentioned that in the near term, pricing is holding up. But as you think about calendar '25, I think some of your peers have talked about pricing trends potentially reverting to pre-pandemic patterns down, call it, low singles. Is that a view that you would agree with or share? Or do you feel or think differently on pricing? Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. All right. So on inventory days, longer term, our model is -- and this really hasn't changed from what we shared back in our Analyst and Investor Day that we're targeting 130 to 150 days. Now we're a long ways from that today, and I'm not going to put a time horizon on when we will get there, but that's still the goal, right? We think with that level in a more normalized environment, we can have short lead times and support our customers appropriately with that level. So I'll turn the pricing question over to Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: And I would add one more thing, which is we also have these last time buys that we put into place on very high gross margin product lines, and those will be additive and they are situational depending on when we're faced with that kind of situation. On the pricing itself, our pricing is predominantly a function of what we have to compete with at the point of design. And so in the near term, pricing is really driven by where designs were historically what we won them at. And a lot of these are products going into applications. that have long life cycles and they don't really change, unlikely consumer electronics or other end markets, they don't really every 9, 12 months change things out. We have products that have been in designs for five, seven, nine, 10 years in many cases as well. We are being competitive on new designs with pricing where we need to be, but we also have new products that we compete with. And so the most competitive new products are what we use to go fight in the most price-sensitive new design applications. And that's been historically how spend is not something new. And if we go back and look at 20 years of Microchip, that's how we've done it. And we have a lot of business that continues, that will be existing business at existing prices for a long, long time to come. And then we'll have new business at new pricing. And that new pricing, we expect will have good gross margins as time goes on.
Toshiya Hari: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua Buchalter: Hi guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess to start, maybe I can follow up on the previous one. You mentioned pricing hanging in overall, but competing more on new design wins. Have those -- are you observing those new design wins becoming any more price sensitive or more price competitive as the shortages have eased and we've entered this correction mode? Or sort of still normal operating and competitive conditions? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: New designs have always been highly competitive. It's where people are trying to work on winning platforms with multiyear implications. So it is in the couple of years of constraints, there were fewer new platforms, new designs that customers are doing. But in the sense of having to be competitive and the competitive intensity for new designs, yes, it is different from the last two years or three years, but it is consistent with what it has been over 20 years before that.
Joshua Buchalter: That's clear. Thank you. I appreciate the color there. And then for my follow-up, the CapEx guidance is obviously down meaningfully off of what was likely a peak two years ago. Could you maybe just speak to your confidence in having enough capacity both internally and perhaps more importantly, investment from your foundry partners at the process geometries that you ship your products on? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. So when we say -- it's a plan that we look at consistently, both short, medium and long term. We feel very confident with the internal capacity, both what is installed and underutilized, what is available and ready to go and then eventually what we might add to it. And then we work with our partners, both the foundries as well as the OSATs on their capacity planning across the horizon that they have. We're obviously a small piece of a much bigger pie there that they're running. But we don't have any particular capacity constraints that we're concerned about. It may change as demand begins to come back, and if in fact, there is a much sharper rise as some people are predicting. But for the moment, we're quite confident both in our internal, as well as our partner capacity for the business we're running.
Joshua Buchalter: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Chris Danely with Citibank. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Danely: Hi, thanks guys. So now that we're yet another quarter into the correction and hopefully coming out of it, if we look at your total drop in terms of revenue, it is probably going to be like 45%, something like that. And that's worse than most of your competitors. So I guess, why do you think that is? Do you think that the PSP program encouraged a little double ordering? Is there some geographic or something else going on? Just looking for some for your take on why that's happened?
Ganesh Moorthy: No, great question, Chris. When you look at peak to trough, it’s always a question of when does it start? And when does it bottom out, right? You've seen one of our peer group companies that try to do a peak to trough in one quarter. And you could say, boy, that was one way to do it. Our objective has always been to try to respond as the business is changing. And so we've had different end markets responding at different times. We had a lot of automotive and industrial. They were later in the cycle. And our mix is higher in some of those markets as well. And in this case, the downturn is substantially deeper than what anybody had expected on that. And that's probably a component of PSP that may have amplified some of those things, et cetera. But a lot of it has to do with we started later, and we are correcting stronger. And the end markets that we are predominantly represented in were the ones with the later in the cycle correction than perhaps those that are more consumer or phone or PC, that kind of exposure.
Chris Danely: Got it. Thanks Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Vijay Rakesh: Yeah. Just a quick question on the competitive landscape, I guess, especially as you look at kind of China supply. Is there any worry around them being aggressive on the microcontroller supply coming out from there? What are you seeing in those trends?
Ganesh Moorthy: China has always been a competitor in many of the spaces that we're in. Their approach is a little bit different. They have a lot of their attention going into things that can be faster to market quicker. And those tend to take them into places like consumer electronics and the other areas that are faster designed in cycle, a lot of the power supplies for cell phones and those kind of things. Clearly, they are also making products that can go into other end applications. And that’s a competitive environment that is not different today. You could argue perhaps that there's a lot of attendant priority that they have. But we win with new products, we win with competitive solutions that we have. And we win by providing the customer with a solution that is better than what they can get otherwise. And that remains the way in which we've gone to market, and we'll continue to fight for new business in China and anywhere else.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And then as you look at the utilization, I don't know if you give a hard number there. But how do you see that playing out through the rest of the year? I know there's a lot of moving parts to that. But any way to look at what utilization looks like? I know you cut CapEx pretty significantly to so that should help.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. So we don't break out a specific utilization in total, we have -- it varies very much by factory. We have had some attrition in employee headcount, which I mentioned in response to an earlier question that just makes it as we go by the months and aren't rehiring that capacity utilization would come down modestly. So I'm not expecting a huge change from March to June, maybe just a little bit lower. And then obviously, actions depending on what our outlook is on revenue and inventory will drive what the rest of the year looks like as we gain a little bit more confidence in understanding where the business is heading over the coming months.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from William Stein with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.
William Stein: Great. It was interesting to see a couple of tuck-in acquisitions this quarter. I'm wondering if you could talk about the relative focus of that approach to capital deployment or, let's say, product development going forward relative to internal development?
Ganesh Moorthy: So we have an internal development that works on the model that we have provided, which over the long term is the 68% gross margin, 23% operating expense, 45% operating margin. That allows for the prioritization of our internal activities and where we want to apply it for different opportunities that we have in front of us. From time-to-time, we find our external opportunities where the speed at which we could do something or the time that it would involve in trying to get to a solution can be a lot longer if we were to do it just organically. And there, we have applied these tuck-in acquisitions as a way to speed up what we're able to do, consistent with the direction that we are interested in or have been following for a while. And we've done about six or eight of them now in the last four or five years of time ever since. Microsemi was the last major public acquisition we did. We've done about six to eight smaller ones since then. And it always to speed up our agenda with a very tactical and a pinpoint strike on what the acquisition can do for the areas that we're driving growth in. And we will do more of those, as we continue on as well. Let's say we've always been public. That's an essential part of our strategy.
William Stein: As a follow-up, it does sound that while you anticipate revenue to grow in September, I would imagine the inventory burn isn't done at the end of June. I wonder if you can maybe help us understand when we should expect a situation where your revenue is approximately the same as in demand? In other words, when the inventory reductions will be mostly done? Do you think that's -- have I misread you and that actually does happen in June? Or do you think it is more like September or even further out? Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: So I will start with the response here. I mean I think the bottom-line is, well, with 125,000 customers, it is impossible to know when -- and all customers a majority of customers have kind of corrected in their inventory to what they think the right level is and that's somewhat a moving target as lead times adjust based on whatever point in the cycle that we're at. So we don't have a good answer to be able to answer your question there. We’ll obviously, give guidance for the next quarter, and we'll have more information that we can share at that time. But I think that from customers, this inventory correction is going to last beyond this quarter. I think that absolutely is the case.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. I think many customers made their own mistakes on how they viewed their business, what they thought the prospects were. Many other customers were very thoughtful, continue to be strong players and where they're at. And as we gave you some indications of certain end markets where there is strength as well. So it's all over the place. And just as a preponderance of people who are done with their inventory correction and are now going back into buying for their consumption and/or into growth that they may be seeing. The weighted average begins to shift, and that's the weighted average that begins to shift in September.
William Stein: Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from David O'Connor with BNP. Please proceed with your question.
David O'Connor: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Two from my side. Maybe firstly just on the green shoots, can you talk about them from a geographical perspective? Is it mainly China driven? And now you're seeing that continue in Europe and the US? Or how would you describe it geographically?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. So the green shoots are not limited to any one geography, not limited to any one end market. it's really across all of them. And as I mentioned, you're going to have in a geography or in an end market, both customers with continued pain and other customers who are starting to look at how to get back into growth mode and what they're doing. So no specific end market or geography leading to the green shoots.
David O'Connor: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe just on the acquisition, the Neuronix Labs acquisition. It seems like it helps you address the AGI market with your [MCUs] (ph), can you maybe talk about the kind of content tailwind for your MCUs for AGI that this can generate? Or how much of your MCU portfolio are customers looking to add AI content in the next-gen products to kind of run those AGI models? Can you give us any more color on that would be helpful. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: I don't know if there's a numerical way to give you that. I think -- that's all I said. I believe that embedded customers are thinking about how AI can be used in delivering better solutions than what they have in the past. No different from -- if you go back in the chronology from 20 years, 25 years ago, people added intelligence first because you could make a product better with intelligent add it, then further out in time, people added connectivity as a way to now make it even better than just adding intelligence and then they added security thing. And now finally, I think AI is the next leg of how people will add capability to the products to make them better. So it's a journey, and there's going to be many customers who don't need to do anything with AI. Others who are seeing the opportunity, and we'll take advantage of that in the next generation of their products. But I think, you should think of it as a continuum of customers. They're all looking to innovate. AI gives them another opportunity in their platforms to be able to innovate and provide better products than their previous generations.
David O'Connor: That’s helpful. Thanks Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Lipacis: Thanks for taking my question. I think this is for Ganesh or Steve. I'm wondering what is the difference between the setup for Microchip's business over the next six months and the setup that you see at the bottom of every cycle? It seems like there's a lot of similarities, and I'm hoping you can tell me the difference. The similarities I see are -- there is some kind of demand shock or a big inventory build and then our customers and the supply chain downstream from them, recognize that, so they decide that they are going to supply themselves out of their own inventories, they cancel orders or they take orders down and then you don't get any visibilities. So you and your peers take your utilization rates down and sometimes do temporary fab shutdowns. And then your customers have an epiphany that they overcorrected on the downside and in three, four quarters from here everybody is taking their numbers up and everybody scrambled in to get components. So those are the similarities I see. What are the differences? And if you have a disagreement over those similarities, I'd love to hear that, too. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Mark, I think you have answered your question. We couldn't say any better. You asked the question when you answered it, I think it's perfect.
Ganesh Moorthy: Mark, I was going to welcome you back -- answer as well. And as you said, I think this is a cycle we've seen play out many times, and the elements that you answered or the elements that you proposed are there. I don't know if any differences in this one. Obviously, the length of the up cycle sometimes affects the depth of the down cycle. But other than that, the elements are very similar.
Mark Lipacis: I was hoping you might say, well, the supply chain has learned or lessen over the last three years and recognize that you guys need to have visibility because there's a manufacturing cycle time. So is that -- is the supply chain not learned anything downstream from you? Is it -- we're just doing the same over and over again?
Ganesh Moorthy: No. So yes, I had assumed that during the depth of the constraints with all the different discussions I was having with the senior executives at our customers that they would come out of this cycle with a better understanding of how semiconductor supply works and what they would need to be to be more strategic. But I have been surprised at how quickly people have forgotten and how quickly people have returned back to the way they used to think. Basically, they think semiconductors are like water in your tap. You turn on the tap and the water comes and you turn off the tap, and it goes away. And so I am of the belief that those lessons will have to be relearned again as we go through the cycle. And we'll see how the cycle goes. But no, there has not been any -- there are a few. But for the most part, those learnings have not carried forward.
Mark Lipacis: So last is repeat off the bottom?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. Mark, from time to time, some people have written or talked about industry has matured, and there will not be any cycles anymore. I think, all those predictions have been wrong. Industry has always been cyclic and will always be cyclic. I think our customers, our distributors, vendors, suppliers, they don't learn. And I think, people change new purchasing managers come in, new people come in. And as Ganesh described, the lessons I've forgotten very rapidly, leading just these cycles never going away. And this one was the most pronounced cycle, both on the upside and now we're seeing on the downside.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. I was just going to make the point is I view this as inventory correction on steroids, right? I mean we had not seen our lead times for the vast majority of our products go to 52 weeks before and then they contracted over a period of 12 months down to these very short lead times that we have today.
Mark Lipacis: Very, helpful. Thanks everybody.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you Mark.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. Can you give us some color on the FPGA business. And I wonder, it sounded like some pretty good growth relative to the peers for the fiscal year. Can you talk about the trajectory of that? Have you seen -- it's obviously been a tough patch for FPGAs as well. Has that looked similar to the rest of your business? Has there been an outperformance relative to that? And can you talk about your market share prospects going forward in there?
Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So our FPGA business has, in fact performed better than our other businesses. And in part, it's because our FPGA business has historically had a large aerospace and defense component and continues to. Now we have, over the last four, five years, been creating the new design opportunities for FPGA in the longer term to grow in industrial and automotive and the historical end market strengths that Microchip had before we got the FPGA business. And so this -- it is not immune to market forces and where things are going to go. But it has got a better end market mix than some of our other businesses and therefore, has performed better. And of course, we are picking up designs that in the long term that are falling off of Erstwhile, Xilinx and Erstwhile [Ultera] (ph), as they take focus away from the mid care over many years that they have done or end-of-lifeing products, right? Those are all creating opportunities for our FPGA business. And so I am very, very optimistic about prospects for our FPGA business.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Rolland: Hi guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, first of all, Ganesh, like in terms of this inventory, are there any products or markets that have surprised you either that they burn inventory and a normalized quicker than you expected or that this is going to take longer for these products or markets?
Ganesh Moorthy: I think not so much my product, but I think if you look at specific customers, in many cases, even in the same market, right? So we can have an end market, say, industrial. And we have examples of certain customers who have burned through their inventory and they're back asking for new orders at expedited times. We also have other customers, same industry who are still burning through inventory and taking longer where it goes. So I think a lot depends on a customer, their market prospects, what did they do to create and grow their business and how well are they executing? And so that's really been the difference is that it's customer by customer, the stories are different.
Christopher Rolland: Yes. Understood. And then if I'm hearing you correctly, you think June is the bottom. A lot of that is inventory based. I'd like an idea of how you're looking at the inventory position in September at your customers more generally? Do you think we can get back to seasonal trends in September and going forward? Or is there still this inventory drag overall?
Ganesh Moorthy: No, I think there's going to be customers at different points in the correction cycle. Some will have corrected and moved on, others will still be correcting. So I think seasonality is perhaps one of the things which you need a level of normalcy for some period of time before you can say, okay. We now have all these variables that have been taken out. So I can't say we have seasonality in the September quarter. I can say that incrementally, on a weighted average basis, there are more customers who are going to be out of their inventory correction, but not that they're all done.
Christopher Rolland: Great. Thank you Ganesh.
Operator: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question.
Tore Svanberg: Yeah, thank you. Just one quick follow-up. Ganesh, you said that you still need quite a bit of turns this quarter. Just wondering what is the churn's requirement? And how does that compare with the previous cycle troughs? Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: So we are not going to break out the amount of turns that are required, but we do have turns and take to meet our guidance, and our guidance is obviously to have another down quarter. But lead times are short. We are getting these requests for pull-in. I don't have a good comparison to give you in terms of prior cycles. If this turns out to be the bottom for us, which we believe it will, we can probably give some commentary when we talk about our September guidance as we kind of hit and move through that bottom.
Ganesh Moorthy: So one of the things which is more difficult to do is most people talk about turns in a normal environment where there isn't inventory out there. And it's harder to -- we can say, hey, the turns are x-percent from a historical basis. But when there is inventory, we know those turns aren't going to show up because people will burn though inventory before they begin to place it. And I think that's some of the hesitation we have and trying to provide some insight where we know there's a lot of uncertainty. What we have done is done the best of our assessment of what those are going to be, where they're going to be and build it into the guidance. And so I think that's the best way to think about it is that we have taken into account the risks that are present from inventory that would otherwise cause headwinds to turns in the quarter.
Tore Svanberg: Very clear. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Vivek Arya: Hi, thanks for the quick follow-up. I just wanted to clarify what is the contribution of the acquisitions in the June quarter or in fiscal '25? And then, Ganesh, back to the September quarter, I think you did say that you expect it to grow. I understand that it's had to put a seasonal number on it. But based on what you have seen in prior downturns, just the fact that Microchip has gone down so much from peak to trough, should we also expect kind of sharper recovery back to when you do start recovering?
Ganesh Moorthy: So to answer your first question, these are small tuck-in acquisitions. They're intended to accelerate our effort on design-ins and design-wins and all of that. So they don't have any revenue contribution in the June quarter or in the September quarter, for that matter. In terms of the revenue and what happens as the correction happens, yes. You should think that at some point, and I can't tell you is it in September or is it in December, you will see -- we will see a sharper recovery. That's how it has played itself out in many other cycles as well. And there are two stages to it. There's the first stage, which is just people needing to get back to -- they've burned through most of the inventory and they need to get back to at least buying to consumption. And then there is a second phase, which is what is the macro doing? And is the macro driving further growth for them above just what their flattened consumption line alone might tell us. And I think all of that, if you look forward into a likely environment over the next 12 months, should give us a sharper recovery.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the floor back over to Ganesh Moorthy for any closing comments.
Ganesh Moorthy: Great. I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call. I know we ran over a little bit. But I appreciate the questions, and we look forward to seeing and talking to many of you in the coming days as well as many of the conferences that are coming up. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-02-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Microchip's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, CFO, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Thank you. You may begin.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you operator. Good afternoon everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC, that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip’s President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip’s Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip’s Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2024 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance. And Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations' page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation, and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliations on our website. Net sales in the December quarter were $1.766 billion, which was down 21.7% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 63.8%, operating expenses were 22.5%, and operating income was 41.2%. Non-GAAP net income was $592.7 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.08. On a GAAP basis, in the December quarter, gross margins were 63.4%. Total operating expenses were $590.6 million and included acquisition and tangible amortization of $151.3 million, special charges of $1.1 million, share-based compensation of $38.8 million, and $1.5 million of other expenses. GAAP net income was $419.2 million, resulting in $0.77 in earnings per diluted share. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted from an IRS notice that clarified the treatment of costs incurred by a research provider under contract that we had been accruing for and that accrual was released in the quarter. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 13.2% in the December quarter. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be just under 14% and which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. Our fiscal 2024 cash tax rate is higher than our fiscal 2023 tax rate was for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits, lower tax depreciation with our expectation for lower capital expenditures in the U.S. in fiscal 2024, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. The House actually passed the tax bill last night that would achieve this, and we will see how this progresses through the Senate. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis points favorable adjustment to Microchip's non-GAAP tax rate in future periods. Our inventory balance at December 31, 2023, was $1.31 billion. We had 185 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, which was up 18 days from the prior quarter's level. Although, we reduced inventory dollars in the quarter, we were not able to make as much progress as we would have liked, as we continue to accommodate requests by customers to push out delivery schedules for products that were very far through the manufacturing process. At the midpoint of our March 2024 quarter guidance, we would expect inventory dollars to be up modestly and days of inventory to be in the range of 225 to 230 days due to the significant reduction in revenue and cost of goods sold. We also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners and these last time buys represented 10 days of inventory at the end of December. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were 37 days, which was up two days from the prior quarter's level. Our cash flow from operating activities was $853.3 million in the December quarter. Included in our cash flow from operating activities was $30.4 million of long-term supply assurance receipts from customers. We have adjusted these items out of our free cash flow to determine the adjusted free cash flow that we will return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as these supply assurance payments will be refundable over time as purchase commitments are fulfilled. Our adjusted free cash flow was $763.4 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $281 million. Our total debt decreased by $392 million in the December quarter, our net debt decreased by $416.4 million in the quarter. Over the last 22 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $7.1 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt. Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was $796.2 million and 45.1% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $4.26 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.27 times at December 31, 2023, down from 1.56 times at December 31, 2022. Capital expenditures were $59.5 million in the December quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 is between $300 million and $310 million, which is down from the $300 million to $325 million we shared with investors last quarter as we are delaying certain capital given the more challenging economic backdrop. We expect that our capital investments will continue to provide us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $47.1 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter as well as our guidance for the March quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric and good afternoon everyone. Our December quarter results were disappointing and below our expectations with net sales down 21.7% sequentially and down 18.6% from the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP gross and operating margins came in at 63.8% and 41.2%, respectively, down from our recent strong performance, but somewhat resilient despite the significant sequential decline in revenue. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS came in at $1.08 per share, down 30.8% from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was 45.1% of net sales in the December quarter, continuing to demonstrate some resiliency. As a result, we had good debt reduction in the December quarter and despite the lower adjusted EBITDA we generated, our net leverage ticked down to 1.27x. However, we expect our net leverage ratio to rise for a few quarters, as trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA drops when replacing stronger prior year quarters with weaker ones. Our capital return to shareholders in the March quarter will increase to 82.5% of our December quarter adjusted free cash flow as we continue on our path to return 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter of calendar year 2025. My thanks to our worldwide team for their support, hard work, and diligence as we navigated a difficult environment and focus on what we could control so that we are well-positioned to thrive in the long-term. Taking a look at our December quarter net sales from a product line perspective, our mixed-signal microcontroller net sales were down 22.3% sequentially and down 18.5% on a year-over-year basis. And our analog net sales were down 30.9% sequentially and down 29% on a year-over-year basis. Now, for some color on the December quarter. and the general business environment. All regions of the world and most of our end markets were weak. Our business was weaker than we expected as our customers continue to respond to the effects of increasing business uncertainty, slowing economic activity and a resultant increase in their inventory. In addition, many customers implemented extended shutdowns of closures at the end of the December quarter as they manage their operational activities. We continue to receive requests to push out or cancel backlog as customers sought to rebalance their inventory in light of the weaker business conditions and the increased uncertainty that we're experiencing. And we were able to push out or cancel backlog to help many customers with these inventory positions. With no major supply constraints, coupled with very short lead-times and a weak macro environment, we believe that is inventory destocking underway at multiple levels at our direct customers and distributors who buy from us, our indirect customers who buy through our distributors, and in some cases, our customers' customers. The very strong up cycle of the last two to three years drove many of our customers to build inventory in order to be able to capitalize on strong business conditions in an uncertain supply environment. The term, just in case, instead of just in time, was used by customers to express their approach to these conditions. But as the macro environment slowed, many of our customers found their business expectations to be too optimistic and ended up with high levels of inventory. And as a result, they sought to cancel or reschedule backlog. An update on our PSP program. During the early stages of the up cycle, we launched our PSP program requiring noncancelable backlog in exchange for supply priority in a hyper constrained supply environment. The program was aimed to discourage speculative demand and achieve mutual commitments between our customers and us for future demand. The program worked extremely well for many customers who participated during all of 2021 and 2022, as well as the early part of 2023, supporting strong growth in their businesses. However, the business challenges, which led to the creation of the PSP program are no longer relevant, and we have, therefore, decided to discontinue the program effective today. If business conditions warranted, we may at some point in the future, initiate a similar program, which will, of course, have to be adapted to whatever that situation requires. Reflecting the slowing macro environment, our distribution inventory grew to 37 days at the end of the December quarter, as compared to 35 days at the end of the September quarter. We are working with our distribution partners to find the right balance of inventory required to serve their customers, manage their cash flow requirements and be positioned for the eventual strengthening of business conditions. Our internal capacity expansion actions remain paused. Given the severity of the down cycle, our factories around the world will be running at lower utilization rates and also taking up to two shutdown weeks in each of the March and June quarters in order to help control the growth of inventory. We expect our capital investments in fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2025 will be low even as we prepare for the long-term growth of our business. To that end, we reached a preliminary memorandum of terms with the Department of Commerce for $162 million in grants targeted at existing projects for two of our U.S. fabs. These grants are subject to diligence by the Chip's office as well as capacity investments by Microchip over multiple years. We have been driving our lead times down and have reduced average lead times from roughly 52 weeks at the start of 2023 to roughly eight weeks by the end of 2023 on average. During a period of macro weakness and business uncertainty, we believe short lead times are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed with us as it enables our customers and Microchip to engage an uncertain environment with more agility and effectiveness. However, a significant reduction in lead times is also resulting in lower bookings and reduced near-term visibility for our business. We're also taking steps to reduce our expenses. In addition to the variable compensation programs, which provide automatic reductions during a down cycle and normal containment of discretionary expenses, we will be implementing broad-based paid reductions. Our team members who are not a part of the factory shutdowns will take a 10% pay cut and consistent with our normal practice, the executive team will take the largest reduction with a 20% pay cut. The shutdowns for manufacturing team members and pay cuts for non-manufacturing team members are consistent with our long-standing culture of shared sacrifices and down cycles and shared rewards and up cycles. That's avoiding layoffs, and in the process protecting manufacturing capability, as well as high priority projects, which are important for our customers and us to thrive in the long-term. We took similar actions in prior periods of business uncertainty such as the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, and we believe such actions were quite effective to navigate our business. Now, let's get into our guidance for the March quarter. As our customers take further actions to adjust to a weakening macro environment and uncertain business conditions, we are continuing to support customers and channel partners with inventory position to push out or cancel their backlog. We recognize that our short lead times and increased flexibility with backlog will result in customers reducing inventory aggressively, and that this could result in some degree of overcorrection. However, in response to these conditions, we are continuing to work with our customers to absorb as much of the inventory correction as we can at this time. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be between $1.225 billion and $1.425 billion. The guidance range is larger than normal to reflect the macro uncertainty and the resultant low business visibility. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59% and 61.6% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 26.9% and 30.7% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.3% and 34.7% of sales and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.46 and $0.68. To keep things in perspective, while our business results have degraded significantly over the last two quarters, as a larger-than-normal inventory correction has played out. Our full fiscal year 2024 revenue decline at the midpoint of the March quarter guidance is expected to be roughly 9.5% and comparing favorably with weakness that other industry players have experienced. Our non-GAAP operating margin for full fiscal year 2024 at the midpoint of our March quarter guidance is expected to be 43.6% and continuing to be among the best results across other companies in our industry. While we don't know how and when the inevitable up cycle will play out, we believe the fundamental characteristics of our business remain intact. Finally, notwithstanding any near-term macro weakness, we are confident that our solutions remain the engine of innovation for the applications and end markets we serve. Our focus on total system solutions and key market megatrends continue to fuel strong design win momentum, which we expect will drive above-market long-term growth. With that, let me pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh and good afternoon everyone. I would like to provide you with a further update on our cash return strategy. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 25.7% from the year ago quarter to $0.45 per share. During the last quarter, we purchased $114.6 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $237.4 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $352 million. This amount was 77.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $454.3 million during the September 2023 quarter. Our net leverage at the end of December 2023 quarter was 1.27 times. Ever since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through December 31, 2023 by a combination of dividends and share buybacks. During this time, we have bought back approximately 26 million shares of our common stock from the open market, representing approximately 4.5% of our shares outstanding. In the current March quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow from the December quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes a net $30.4 million that we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when purchase commitments are fulfilled. The adjusted free cash flow for the December quarter was $763.4 million. We plan to return 82.5% or $629.8 million of that amount to our shareholders with the dividend expected to be approximately $243 million and the stock buyback expected to be approximately $386.8 million, which will be a new quarterly record for stock buyback since we initiated our enhanced capital return strategy. Going forward, we plan to continue to increase our adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders. That will take four more quarters and we expect that dividends over time will represent approximately 50% of our cash returned. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks a lot. I wanted to ask about how much of a headwind the inventory inside of distribution still is. Shipments into distribution were down about 30%, well, actually more than that, and yet some of your largest cities are still saying that they're having a hard time working down inventory. So can you provide any guidance like does the March guidance assume that shipments into distribution will be down a lot more than what the corporate guidance is, again, just like it was in December?
Ganesh Moorthy: We are expecting that we will drain inventory in distribution in the March quarter.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, great. And then, Eric, can you talk about utilization rates and the potential for some write-downs? We sort of haven't been at a level yet where you would write things down, but can you talk about that? Thanks.
Eric Bjornholt: Sure. So we have been working on an employee attrition basis in our three large fabs, and through the December quarter, that did not put us in a situation where we were taking underutilization charges from those three fabs. That will change this quarter as we have continued to attrit. And as Ganesh kind of walked through, we've got two-week shutdowns scheduled in all three of those large factories. So, we aren't going to break out a utilization percentage, but underutilization is absolutely impacting our business, our gross margins in the current quarter. And on top of that, with the change that we've seen in demand and inventory still being high. We have been taking relatively large charges for inventory reserves based on our accounting policies that we have in place. And all those things are really factored into the margin guidance that we've given to the Street.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Toshiya Hari: Hi thank you. My first question is on cancellation rates and what you're seeing from a customer pushout perspective. Are you seeing any signs of stabilization, Ganesh, in terms of cancellation rates or pretty much the same so far in the quarter relative to December and September of last year?
Ganesh Moorthy: We don't have a numerical tracking process. We still have customers that have asked for help. We have done a lot of that and built it into what we have into our guidance. I don't know if you have a better view, Eric, on cancellation rates.
Eric Bjornholt: Right. I would say, as we kind of talked about customers and distributors are feeling like they have excess inventory. And with that, if they have backlog in place for those products, they are either not placing backlog. But if they have backlog in place, they're looking to see if there's an ability for them to at least push that out. So, we're having those ongoing discussions and I'd say that they're still at a relatively high rating.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you. And as my follow-up, I was hoping to get your comments on pricing, the headwinds you're seeing today, is it mostly volume-driven or are you starting to see price erode as well between your microcontroller business and analog business? It seems like at the industry level, you've got more supply coming online over the next couple of quarters, several quarters. So, curious how you're - what you're seeing today and how you're thinking about pricing as we progress through calendar 2024? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. All the revenue declines are really volume declines and not pricing related. Pricing is stable. It is not contributing to the revenue change that is in our guidance. Our business is one which is based on design-ins that are done one, two, three years before and production that takes place for many, many years. it's not an easy substitution that takes place on short-term price adjustments, et cetera. Clearly, at the point of where new designs are taking place, we will be price competitive to what the new design requires. But today's revenue adjustments downward are not happening because of price. Price is stable.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good evening. My question is - and it's a difficult question about sort of where you think aggregate inventory levels are and how much progress with some of these lower revenue shipment rates that we'll make in getting those inventories down over time. I know that's difficult to answer for your end customers, your indirect customers, but perhaps you could address it from the distribution channel where you have a little more visibility and where the target inventory levels are and where you expect to get over time?
Ganesh Moorthy: As you said, inventory in some cases is obscure to us, we have to estimate based on where customers are placing orders, what kind of feedback they're giving us. We know we're going to be substantially under shipping to where consumption is going to be. But it's very hard to put a number on what that is and how much of the inventory has been taken out. And as I said, in some cases, it is multiple layers of inventory and especially as people are getting to that point where they are less willing to carry inventory, perhaps even take it to the low end of what they might historically do, because supply is plentiful. Not all of this is just inventory reduction as you would normally expect. But it is going to be at multiple levels to our customers, to their customers and in some cases, if they have an OEM that goes to the OEM there as well. So we don't have a good way to put a number on what you're asking for.
Chris Caso: Okay. Fair enough. One of the things you've also said in prior downturns is typically, you've seen three down quarters before you achieve a bottom, you're at that now, although September quarter was obviously a much smaller magnitude than now. Given where we are right now, do you think that still holds? And perhaps you could characterize this downturn against some of the prior ones that you've been through?
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, there's nothing typical about this downturn. And I don't think that is a good comparison to history. You could say in magnitude, it is on the order of what we've seen in the global financial crisis. I think we were down 36% or so at that point in time. We have very limited visibility in today's market conditions. And so it's difficult to say where exactly this is and as I mentioned, we believe we are significantly under shipping to end demand, but we're unable to provide any kind of forecast or guidance beyond this quarter.
Chris Caso: Fair enough. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with SIG. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Rolland: Hi guys. Thanks for the question. So around cycle times and lead times, we have found that some of your products, particularly through distribution, they have lead times that are even below your cycle times. I'm assuming your cycle times are something like four weeks or six weeks, something like that. I guess my question is, how long would you expect this dynamic to last? I think this is – if you do have big inventory corrections like we're going through, you see that phenomenon occasionally, but how long might this last? And when are you expecting lead times to maybe again, obviously, we have some - an inventory dynamic we're going through here. But maybe talk about that lead times versus cycle times and when you think that those might actually rise again.
Ganesh Moorthy: Chris, let me just define two terms and then we'll walk through it. So cycle time is the time it takes from when you begin with raw material and get to finished goods. That cycle time for semiconductors, depending on which product and what process can be anywhere from three to five months, sometimes longer, depending on the specialty. So that's the typical production cycle time. We have always been able to manage lead times, which we define as from a when a customer places an order on us, when can we ship the product to them to be a lot shorter than that. And historically pre-pandemic. That was four to eight weeks was not an unusual number for 80%, 90% of our line items. Where we have come back to is where those lead-times are on average where a customer places an order they can get in less than eight weeks. And in some cases, if we have it in finished goods, they can get it much sooner than that as well. So, I don't have a good view of when do lead-times go back out. And I'm not sure that's a good thing. I think we have to, obviously, work to manage the supply and demand consistent with where demand is going. But for years, we ran in that four to eight weeks as a reasonably stable lead-time outside of any major increases or decreases in demand in the marketplace. And right now, we think we're going to be at low lead-times for quite some time. We have inventory that is high, and we'll be growing into the March quarter. And we're going to position that inventory to be able to take advantage of orders that come in with short cycles because visibility is low, and we need to be able to position and take that as quickly as it comes in. So all of our systems are geared towards having shorter lead-times and being able to take orders of the - that are placed with short lead-times, as quickly as we can.
Eric Bjornholt: Maybe just one thing. I think, Chris, maybe what you were getting at is when we have product that is staged in die bank, so it's through the wafer fab that, in many cases, we can turn that through assembly and test in the four to six weeks that you're talking about. And so if that's the case, if it's in die bank, that would be the case. But we've got finished goods today. we're staging the products that are high runners and die bank or lead-times are quite short across the board.
Christopher Rolland: Yes. Thank you very much guys. There were some good stuff there. Eric, while I have you gross margin, just for kind of simplicity sake, my model is roughly like 300 basis points below for next quarter where I was previously I don't know if you can kind of walk us through that, what's mix versus underutilization versus inventory write-down? It sounds like pricing is not an issue here like-for-like, but would love to know how those kind of various things contribute.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. So, I would say the biggest change quarter-to-quarter is going to be in the factory utilization, and that's a combination of the continued attrition and lower production rates on a steady-state weekly basis, and then we're having these two weeks shutdown on top of that. And what we're having time off and some of our back-end factories too, which is larger than the previous quarter. So, all those things impacted, I'd say, the inventory reserve piece is a part of it, but we had relatively significant charges last quarter on that, and I wouldn't expect those to be significantly more this quarter. They'll probably be larger, but the biggest piece is going to be what we're doing on utilization.
Christopher Rolland: Excellent. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Gary Mobley: Hi guys. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Looking at the March quarter guidance, that's basically a peak to trough in revenue terms of more than 40%, all within the same fiscal year. So clearly, the rate of the decay has been extreme. And I'm calling on your experience here, given that you've all been through a lot of cycles in the past and you hinted to in your prepared remarks, maybe some overcorrection on your customer's part in terms of inventory depletion. So calling on your experience, how would you say the slope of the recovery may look given your lead times? Is it a gradual one? Or are we going to see just sharper rebound as we saw in terms of this correction?
Eric Bjornholt: So I'll start and Ganesh or Steve can add to this. I think it is unknown at this point in time, right? We have limited backlog visibility as we look out in time, which you're asking about beyond this quarter, lead times are really short and customers are sitting on a certain level of inventory beyond what they think is necessary for their business today. So until we start getting short-term orders at our lead times and we see that backlog start to build. It's hard for us to really imagine what it's going to do. As Ganesh said before, clearly in this quarter with our revenue guidance, we are shipping below what the end consumption for our products are, and we think that's relatively material. But giving you any guidance in terms of what the slope of the recovery is, I think, it's hard for us to do at this point.
Ganesh Moorthy: I think the recovery has many components to it, right? One is just if you assume business is flat and as the inventory drains, people will, at some point, just have to order enough to get back to flat consumption. Then there is also what does the macro do and what happens in actual consumption over time. And that depends on many things, where is GDP at, what our interest rate is doing, et cetera. And I think those are all variables, which you can't, at least we're not able to plug in and say, this is out the next three, four quarters, the shape of the recovery will look. And we don't have the visibility and backlog to give us any insight into that today.
Gary Mobley: I know I was asking us for a lot there, but I appreciate the color. So it sounds like your OpEx management is more so variable versus structural. And you've, obviously, done this in the past. In this recent round when you've asked employees to take a 10% pay reduction, what was communicated to them in terms of when that might be recouped based on some revenue or performance metrics?
Ganesh Moorthy: I have not been able to speak to the entire Microchip community until I do that on Monday morning. I did write them all a message today after the market closed and before this call to let them know what we were doing. So those are details that I would prefer to first speak to our employees and give them all of that. But this is not new to us. We have done this multiple times. Our culture allows people to understand how shared sacrifice and shared rewards go hand in hand and how that creates excellent outcomes for the company and for the individuals in the process of doing that. And so I'm confident that our team, especially the team that has been through many cycles with us. We'll see it, will help us with it and pull everybody else along as well.
Gary Mobley: Thank you, Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Ganesh, I appreciate you're not going beyond the quarter, but I still wanted to get some help in getting some directional sense of whether June could be flat, up or down because you do have some shutdowns in June, right? You are already planning for that. So that's not a great data point. But then June tends to also be seasonally up for you historically. So, just give us some more color, what is true demand right now? And if you were sitting in our shoes, would you think about June being kind of up, down, flat, even if you don't have an absolute sense of where June might take out?
Ganesh Moorthy: I think the shutdowns that we communicated based on the days of inventory that we closed December and what we have indicated are going to be at the end of March are required steps we need to take. Those are not necessarily trying to provide an indication of where the June business is going to be at. Vivek, the real answer is I don't know. And I think the world is not falling apart. So, we know that consumption is taking place. We know that inventory needs to drain. We're trying to gauge between the environment in the market, the inventory at multiple levels and how all that will drain. We know this business will come back, right? It has - and every previous cycle done that. But I think what you're asking for is a level of precision, which we don't have any empirical data to be able to say, yes, this is what's going to happen and when.
Vivek Arya: And then my bigger question, Ganesh, is that how would you contrast your strategy of maintaining kind of a hybrid manufacturing model, right, where lead-times can suddenly get extended, but your CapEx is low, your profitability is high? To say your other U.S. competitor who has high CapEx, they can usually keep lead-times very low, and they have managed to avoid, right, these kind of very, very large swings. How would you kind of contrast the two strategies? And do you think what you're going through could make you change your strategy about maybe having higher CapEx in the future and always trying to maintain lower lead-times?
Ganesh Moorthy: Again, there are many people that fit into what you described. I'll describe our strategy, which is we run inside of Microchip the products that we know how to run cost effectively and consistently within our manufacturing footprint. That includes both our front end as well as our back end. We have grown that front-end footprint over time, but also our foundry products have grown over time. And that balance has been roughly 40% plus or minus internal, 60% external. We don't try to guide where that percentage needs to go. The market demand drives is it higher or lower from there. But we know what products and technologies make sense within our footprint and what makes sense to drive with our partners. And that's the way we think about it. And in the aggregate, barring any near-term changes like we've had last quarter and this quarter, it's been a very successful strategy in terms of how gross margins over time have accreted and how over many cycles, we've got higher highs and higher lows. So, we're very happy with the strategy we have, and I leave others with their strategy to speak for themselves.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. So, my first question is on the PSP program. It was obviously put in place to try and avoid volatility and doesn't look like that happened. Maybe it was just the nature of the pandemic cycle, I don't know. But why do you think the PSP program did not sort of buffer the volatility that we're actually seeing?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's a great question. Although the PSP program was aimed at discouraging speculative demand by making orders NCNR and then giving us confidence to make investments on it. I think there was a combination of very strong OEM market demand, our customers and their customers and what they were seeing. They were persistent shortages over a long period of time and very long lead times. And I think when you put all that together, OEM customers ended up placing more backlog because they believe their business was a lot stronger than they thought, and they were trying to place orders for a lot longer than they normally would in that. So that's the way it, in our perspective, played out. How it did phenomenally for them in the 2021, 2022 time frame where those that were in the program, we're able to keep their business going, take market share away and driving. But at the end of the day, the longer lead times get the further out someone is trying to predict where their business is going to be. And I think that's the issue at some point in time is you don't know what your demand is with any kind of high confidence one year or 18 months out, that people were placing those orders as non-cancelable, thinking that the demand was strong and assuming that the risk was a good risk for them to take.
Tore Svanberg: No, that's very fair. And then as my follow-up, I recognize that all end markets are going to be weak in the March quarter. But any sort of relative comment on the end markets, anything holding up a little bit relatively better than others?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. I would say if you look at our aerospace and defense market, there are strengths in those. The commercial aviation remains strong. The defense remains strong. Space has always been very lumpy in where it's at. Our portion of the data center, which is around AI platforms, those are doing extremely well. It's not big enough to move the Microchip needle overall, but it's certainly a pocket of strength that we see as well.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Thank you very much.
Ganesh Moorthy: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Danely: Thanks guys. I guess just a little clarification on the decline here. Any comments on just your sense of end demand, maybe talk about the end markets that have been the worst? And then also, given your revenue decline is notably more than some of your peers, why do you think it's hitting you more than some of the competition?
Ganesh Moorthy: Sorry, what was the last part of your question? Why do you think what?
Chris Danely: Why is your revenue declining much more than some of your competitors?
Ganesh Moorthy: Okay. So on your second question, as I said, if you look at it over a year's period of time, you're going to find that the fiscal 2024 at the midpoint of our guidance is about 9.5% down from fiscal 2023. I don't think that's outside of where the normal is at. Within a two-quarter period of time, absolutely, we are correcting and correcting at a faster rate than where we were at. But I think we have to look at area under the curve for revenue rather than just peak to trough alone in terms of what you're going to look at. In terms of end markets, we - sorry, was there a question?
Chris Danely: No, I said thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: Okay. In terms of end markets, as I mentioned, it's weak across the board. We don't track at a quarterly level kind of how they're all moving. But we have enough anecdotal data. I think we were among the earliest people as early as two or three quarters ago saying automotive is starting to weaken and roll over and industrial did and data center had been. So we have seen this for some time. And at this point in time, I would say that they're all week. There might be individual customers who are stronger or weaker than what – on average that we see but nothing to write home about, other than the two exceptions I spoke about, which is aerospace and defense is still holding up. And our portion of the AI servers that we provide solutions to.
Chris Danely: Thanks Ganesh. And then just a quick clarification on the utilization rates. Do you guys anticipate utilization rates declining again in the June quarter from March? Or will they stay flattish from March to June?
Eric Bjornholt: We don't know yet. We will have to see how kind of the business evolves over the coming months.
Chris Danely: Okay. Thanks Eric.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes, hi. I had a quick question. And I was wondering between the CapEx and the funding that Microchip was getting how much capacity you would be adding on the front end of the back end as you look at calendar 2024, I guess?
Eric Bjornholt: So, our capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 we laid out for you, and that's $300 million to $310 million. We have not given a number for next fiscal year. I expect it to be lower than that. We've actually taken in quite a bit of equipment this year that we have not essentially released and placed in service for production purposes. So, we've got capital that's paid for and at our facilities that we can deploy as the market returns to a more normalized level, and we need that capacity, but I expect CapEx to be quite low in our fiscal year 2025.
Ganesh Moorthy: Vijay, here's how I would think about it from a - how are we positioned for growth from our capacity. Our initial response as this thing changes is going to be utilizing the inventory that we have built and being able to ship using the inventory we have. Our next response will be around getting our factories to more full utilization. We are underutilizing them at this point in time. Our third response would be taking equipment that we have already ordered and received which we will begin to place into production. And then finally, into adding more equipment or bottleneck equipment as the case might be. So, we believe we have plenty of firepower for being able to respond to an up cycle through a combination of those four things.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And if you were to combine all of that, you mentioned your channel disti inventory was at 37 days versus an optimal high 20s, I guess that you mentioned before. And your in-house inventory I probably goes up a little bit as you go to March. Any thoughts on when you actually see that starting to realign or start to stabilize or start to come down? Is that more of a second half? When do you actually see that happening, I guess?
Ganesh Moorthy: If I had a better picture on the demand environment, I could give you a better answer. So, what we're doing is we're taking action on the things we can control, which is our internal capacity, and those are the shutdown days, the lowering of the utilization factors and all that other stuff that we're doing. And that is all in anticipation that at some point, the market will return, and it will reverse cycle at that point in time, first, by us producing less, which we're taking steps for; and second, by the market consuming more, which is what is unknown.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And last question on the margin trajectory for March quarter. Did you say that all of it was because of utilization? And should we expect that underutilization to continue into June? Or how do you see that? Or do you expect utilization to pick back up again?
Eric Bjornholt: So, we didn't say it was all of it. There's a large portion of the change that is utilization driven. There's always product mix and inventory reserves and other things that impact that. I think it will be probably difficult for capacity utilization to increase in the June quarter just because we are running on an attrition basis, and that is continuing each week as some people leave, and then it just takes a while to ramp that back up even if the market dynamics are better. And so that's something that we'll watch very closely and make sure that we're making the appropriate investments in people, but it tends to be like moving a battleship on the ocean, it turns relatively slow.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. I guess, I wonder if you could address a couple of the bear cases that I hear. One, you've sort of talked about PSP and what it accomplished and what it didn't. Do you think that having more flexibility about customer cancellations when they started to slow down, would that have sort of made the issue less bad now? Is the PSP part of the reason why the hole is a little bit deeper, maybe?
Ganesh Moorthy: Perhaps. And I think, again, in retrospect, as a Monday morning quarterback, I know exactly what I would have done. But we were under for many, many, many quarters and even as recently as last March and June quarters, there were CEO-level calls that we're pushing and driving for getting more product than we had. If you remember, we would provide the statistic about how much of unsupported, which is what customers wanted and we couldn't ship was there. So in the throes of all of that, where there parts of it where perhaps we should have taken our foot off the accelerator perhaps. But it isn't something that was now able as we went through it. And if we ever were to do a PSP program again, those are some lessons learned we'll take, and we'll look at how would we adjust the program so that the intended outcomes are available and as many of the unintended outcomes are avoided.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. And then the other kind of negative question that I get, China obviously building significant amount of trailing edge capacity. Can you talk about what types – I don't think you see a lot of direct competition from sovereign China today, but can you talk about how much of your business might see competition from that direction over the next few years? I think you've talked about that being single digits, but maybe if you could just update us on your thinking there.
Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So Mainland China today is about 20-ish percent of our revenue. About half of it, we estimate is designed elsewhere and just happens to be manufactured in Mainland China. And some of that is, frankly, moving out of China as people diversify other things. So it doesn't - the point of design is outside of China, and we're comfortable with that. So the other 10% of our business that's in China that is designed in China has another half of that, which is very complex designs, and these are not the ones that are easy to dislodge and would have a significant amount of knowledge about systems, the software that goes with it, the hardware and software interaction and all that. So that means about 5% of our business, about one-fourth of the business in Mainland China that is our more broad-based microcontrollers and analog and those type of products. And there, fragmentation is our friend. It is a very, very fragmented market. Any one opportunity is a small percentage of revenue, and it is not easy to go to place. But theoretically, you could say if somebody had an identical offering. And by the way, a lot of that business is not just about having silicon. It's about having silicon, having tools, having design guides, having software that we make available. There's a lot of help and self-help that we provide for our customers as well that is there. So, yes, there is more going on in China with trailing edge, both technologies and capacity. And we will pay attention, and we will, through our product line and innovation, cost reduction be continuing to work to go head-to-head against that. But it's the portion of the business that you might think about is more broad-based where they would come after that business is less than 5% and is very, very fragmented and difficult to get at. Does that help?
Joe Moore: Thank you. Yes, so much. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua Buchalter: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about utilization rates and sort of the strategic decisions you're making to shut down the fabs for two weeks in March and June and also keep utilization rates lower over those two quarters. I guess, why start and stop the fabs but also why not just take the utilization rates much lower in the March quarter then see where things play out and given you're trying to get inventory down, but expectations are that it will still go up in March? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: It's a balanced decision that we had to think through and make. But as inventories climbed, there is a point at which the pain gets high enough. And as we looked at that, we felt on balance and we don't know what other supply-demand dynamics may take place. But on balance, this is a way in which we could navigate to different scenarios that might play themselves out. And in the meanwhile, the inventory is high enough that we're comfortable that if the recovery would accelerate, we're in a good place. And we are - if the recovery were something different, that were ahead of us and we have options on what we can do in the June quarter. But right now, we need to prepare for where March and June to the best of our ability to call it is going to be, and that includes be running at a lower utilization and taking a two-week shutdown in the - in our fabs in each of the two quarters.
Joshua Buchalter: And then as my follow-up, and I know you have a formulaic approach to your capital return program, but you've also in the past talked about opportunistically potentially going above the rates that you've outlined as we go through this period where you're going through the digestion and free cash flow is depressed versus where it was the last few quarters, any thought to using the balance sheet or returning more than you would have been returned under the formula that you've outlined? Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: So, maybe I'll start. So I mean, we actually have a very healthy cash return this quarter, right? We increased from 77.5% to 82.5%. The adjusted free cash flow in the December quarter was quite high. And even though the dividend is going up again, we are going to have kind of record share buyback in the quarter based on that formula that you spoke to. So, we think it's appropriate. We're glad that we're going to be buying back a bunch of shares this quarter. Steve, Ganesh can give commentary if the Board would think of doing anything different, but I think that program is kind of in place as it is. And if the market changed and the stock price decline significantly, it would be a discussion with the Board.
Steve Sanghi: I think it just came out naturally that our cash flow was extremely healthy last quarter. And with returning 82.5% back to shareholders with dividend increasing, it still creates a record stock buyback in a quarter, record that we have ever done before, $386.8 million. So it's a very, very healthy buyback. If there was not to be the case, where the cash flow wasn't as healthy as last quarter, then the question would be valid, should we do an extraordinary stock buyback this quarter, if the stock were to become weak. But I think we just formulate – by formula is a very, very healthy amount of cash reserved for stock buyback this quarter.
Ganesh Moorthy: For the last many quarters, we've been steady as she goes. I think having a program that doesn't try to have quarter-to-quarter major variations has been a way in which to establish consistency of the capital return program. And I think Steve and myself and the rest of the Board see that as a way that we should continue with this thing.
Joshua Buchalter: Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. Please proceed with your question.
Quinn Bolton: Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first one is for Eric. You talked about the lower utilization, you're shutting down factories for two weeks in both March and June. I'm just kind of wondering, if you could walk us through the accounting. How much of that hits you in the current period? How much of those lower utilization charges flow-through inventory? And given how much inventory you have could be something that hits gross margin for a longer period of time as that flows through inventory and then the income statement then I've got a quick follow-up.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. So our three large wafer fabs will even without the shutdowns, with the attrition that we've had, be running below what we would call normal utilization. And so these two-week shutdowns will be period costs in the quarter and not capitalized to inventory. Now we are running at lower utilization rates than we were at the peak. So the costs that are being capitalized to inventory on a per unit basis are higher than what they were when we were running at full board. But I think that answers your question. Essentially, the two-week shutdowns will be an impact to the current period and not capitalized into inventory.
Quinn Bolton: That's very, very clear. Thank you. And then I guess just for Ganesh, you mentioned you're ending the PSP program. And so I'm curious, does that just mean you're not signing anyone to new PSP? Does that mean that existing PSPs have now been canceled and folks have greater rights to cancel the existing backlog? Just what happens with the current PSP participants?
Ganesh Moorthy: The backlog has been shrinking for some time. And really, what we're telling customers is that no more orders get accepted that our PSP orders, and customers have seen that lead times are short, capacity is available. As I said, the premise of why we kicked it off no longer exists. And, therefore, it will come to a natural end here fairly quickly, and we just stopped taking more orders that anyone may – if they didn't already understand, replacing as PSP.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist. Please proceed with your question.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for squeezing me. I was also going to ask about PSP and the mechanics of how it rolls out of backlog. But I think you just answered that but I do have a sort of financial question around it. I believe for many of these orders, you were getting prepaid by customers and you might have been likewise prepaying for capacity at foundry. Can you walk through how those roll off of the financial activity of the company and when you expect them to be sort of in the rearview mirror? Is that do you think by the end of the March quarter?
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So, with PSP, those were not typically customer paying cash in advance for any of that. We have certain long-term supply agreements and those had a cash prepayment element to them. Those are still in place. Those aren't - there's nothing that's happening with those programs related to the cancellation of PSP. So, those programs are still in place, and those tend to be three to five-year agreements, most of them five-year agreements, and those will just kind of run out over time. In some cases where customers' demand is not as strong as originally anticipated. We work with them to find a mutually workable answer on that, maybe to extend the program longer, they can add something else into the program for their volume commitments. But we're not looking to penalize customers with that program. And then on the supplier side, we have had certain prepayments that are made and contractual obligations that we have. That's the same thing there. It's a negotiation with our suppliers, and they're working with us, and I don't see that there's any significant financial disadvantage to us coming from those. But in some cases, we have taken on more inventory, maybe raw materials than what we would have otherwise.
William Stein: Great. Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Janet Ramkissoon with Quadra Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Janet Ramkissoon: Hi yes. thanks for taking my questions. Can you guys give us a sense of what's going on with design activity? I know you've seen this real cutback and you're saying that there is really not much of a shortfall in terms of actual demand. Do you have any visibility, less visibility the same as before? Could you give us some sense on what's going on to give us a better sense of the long-term outlook beyond the June quarter?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. No, thank you. So, design activity, as I said in my prepared remarks, is at very high levels. And I think it is because for a number of reasons, customers were in triage for some time as they were dealing with shortages. And as all that went behind, they went back to focusing on innovation. Our products and technologies are enabling innovation in many new fields. And so by many measures, both what we measure internally in terms of design wins and design funnel and all that and what some of our partners who are more design and focused particularly, the catalog distributors are a good example where much of the seeding activity that takes place are also seeing very high levels of that. So, I think the innovation machine is strong. And the inventory correction will pass and go and ultimately, the long-term growth of the business, as you noted, will come from how this innovation plays out and how the overall role content that semiconductors will play in that innovation being delivered on end products.
Janet Ramkissoon: That's very helpful. And just one last one, if I could sneak it in. Is there any particular geography or a particular segment that you saw a faster rate of decline. I noticed that industrial as a percent of total was down just from the supplemental slides. Is there any color that you could give us in terms of geography or end markets where you saw most of the weakness?
Ganesh Moorthy: I think they're all weak. I don't have a numerical way to give you. I can tell you that China, for example, has been weak for an extended period of time. So going back all the way to 2022 when they had the shutdowns, and it really hasn't recovered from there. But I think we've seen weakness in all geographies and pretty much all end markets with the exception of the aerospace and defense and a bit of the data center that was all AI focused. 
Eric Bjornholt: And I believe the end market data that was posted on our website still references last full fiscal year, and that hasn't been updated. That's a process that we do once a year. So we'll take a look at the slide to make sure it's not confusing, but that's what I believe to be the case.
Janet Ramkissoon: Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the floor back over to Ganesh Moorthy for closing comments.
Ganesh Moorthy: Okay. I want to thank everyone for taking the time to be on this call and all of your questions. We look forward to having further discussions during some of the conferences coming up this year. And on that note, we are closing this call.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q2  (2023-11-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Microchip Technology Q2 Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer.
Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everybody. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO and Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2024 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. And Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and the reconciliations on our website. Net sales in the September quarter were $2.254 billion which were down 1.5% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 68.1%, operating expenses were at 20% and operating income was a record 48.1%. Non-GAAP net income was $889.3 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.62. On a GAAP basis in the September quarter, gross margins were 67.8%, total operating expenses were $642.4 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $151.4 million, special charges of $1.8 million, share-based compensation of $38 million and $1.1 million of other expenses. GAAP net income was a record $666.6 million, resulting in a record $1.21 in earnings per diluted share. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 14.2% in the September quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be about 14.2% which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. Our fiscal '24 cash tax rate is expected to be higher than our fiscal '23 tax rate for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits, lower depreciation with our expectation for lower capital expenditures in the U.S. in fiscal '24, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repeal. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchip's non-GAAP tax rate in future periods. Our inventory balance at September 30, 2023, was $1.331 billion. We had 167 days of inventory at the end of the September quarter which was flat to the prior quarter's level. Although we reduced inventory dollars in the quarter, we were not able to make as much progress as we would have liked, as we continue to accommodate requests by customers to push out delivery schedules for products that were very far through the manufacturing process. We also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners and these last-time buys represented 10 days of inventory at the end of September. We expect dollars of inventory on our balance sheet to reduce in the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter was at 35 days which was up 6 days from the prior quarter's level. Our cash flow from operating activities was $616.2 million in the September quarter. Included in our cash flow from operating activities was $87.5 million of long-term supply assurance receipts from customers. We have adjusted these items out of our free cash flow to determine the adjusted free cash flow that we will return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as these supply assurance payments will be refundable over time as purchase commitments are fulfilled. Our adjusted free cash flow was $454.3 million in the September quarter. As of September 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $256.6 million. Our total debt increased by $45.6 million in the September quarter and our net debt was up by $60.2 million. Over the last 21 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi [ph] acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $6.72 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt. In the September quarter, we issued a $750 million Term Loan A and retired $1 billion in bonds that matured on September 1, 2023, with the Term Loan A and proceeds from our line of credit. We also issued $1 billion of commercial paper during the September quarter, taking advantage of about a 90 basis point lower interest rate on the commercial paper compared to our line of credit rate. Our line of credit had $39 million of borrowings against it at September 30, 2023. During the September quarter, we also retired $18.2 million of total principal amount of our 2027 convertible bonds for a total cash payment of $42.7 million. The amount paid above the principal amount essentially works like a synthetic stock buyback, reducing any current and future share count dilution that could result if these convertible bonds were ever converted into shares. The $24.5 million we paid above the par value for the convertible bonds was in addition to our normal share buyback activity that we executed during the quarter, resulting in an additional reduction in the diluted share count outstanding. Our adjusted EBITDA in the September quarter was $1.152 billion and 51.1% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was a record at $4.57 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.28 at September 30, 2023, down from 1.84 at September 30, 2022. Capital expenditures were $74.4 million in the September quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 is between $300 million and $325 million which is down from the $300 million to $350 million we shared with investors last quarter, as we are delaying certain capital given the more challenging economic backdrop. We expect that our capital investments will continue to provide us with increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $47 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter as well as our guidance for the December quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric and good afternoon, everyone. Our September quarter results were about as we expected, with net sales coming in just under the midpoint of our guidance and well within our guidance range. Net sales were down 1.5% sequentially and up 8.7% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP gross and operating margins remained strong at 68.1% and 48.1%, respectively. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS was at the midpoint of our guidance at $1.62 per share, up 11% from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was 51.1% of net sales and adjusted free cash flow was 20.2% of net sales in the September quarter, continuing to demonstrate the strong cash generation characteristics of our business. Our net leverage exiting September dropped to 1.28x. We had higher cash flow outflows in the September quarter compared to the June quarter, due to the timing of tax payments and because of record capital return to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases totaling $562.6 million. This is 61% higher than the capital returned to shareholders in the June quarter. Our capital return to shareholders in the December quarter will increase to 77.5% of our September quarter adjusted free cash flow. As we continue on our path, [indiscernible] down 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter calendar year 2025. My thanks to all our stakeholders, who enabled us to achieve these results despite the increasingly challenging macro environment and especially to the worldwide Microchip team, whose effort and engagement enables us to navigate effectively through the business cycles. Taking a look at our September 1st quarter net sales from a product line and geographic perspective. Our mixed signal Microcontroller [ph] net sales were down 1.7% sequentially and up 8.5% on a year-over-year basis. Our Analog product line, net sales were down 1.7% sequentially and up 8.8% on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential revenue basis, Asia was down, Europe was about flat and the Americas was slightly up. Now for some color on the September quarter. Our business slowed down as expected, as our customers continue to respond to the effects of increasing business uncertainty, slowing economic activity and a result in increase in inventory. The combined effects of persistent inflation and high interest rates, we believe, are contributing to the weak macro environment. All regions of the world and most end markets experienced varying degrees of weakness. We continue to receive requests to push out or cancel backlog, as customers start to rebalance their inventory in light of the weaker business conditions and increased uncertainty they were experiencing. And we were able to push out meaningful amounts of backlog to later quarters to help many customers with inventory positions. We are seeing customers continue to adjust the demand expectations as they derisk the inventory position whenever possible. Our experience from prior cycles is that at this stage of the cycle, customers tend to overcorrect their inventory and backlog due to their business uncertainty, combined with the availability of product with very short lead times. This is, in effect, the flip side of what we saw during 2021 and 2022, when demand was historically strong and seemingly insatiable. Reflecting the slow macro environment, our channel inventory grew 235 days [ph]. We are working with our channel partners to find the right balance of inventory required to serve customers, as well as to be positioned for the eventual strengthening of business conditions. Most of our internal capacity expansion actions remain paused and we expect this will result in lower capital investments in fiscal year '24 and fiscal year '25, even as we prepare for the expected robust long-term growth of our business. In the meanwhile, we have been driving our lead times down and have reduced average lead times from approximately 52 weeks at the start of 2023 to approximately 26 weeks at the end of June and exited the September quarter at approximately 13 weeks. We expect to continue to drive average lead times down further, to less than 8 weeks by the end of 2023. During a period of macro weakness and business uncertainty, we believe short lead times are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed on us, as it enables our customers and Microchip to engage an uncertain environment with more agility and effectiveness. However, the significant reduction in lead times is also resulting in lower bookings and reduced near-term visibility. Now let's get into the guidance for the December quarter. As our customers take further actions to adjust to a weakening macro environment and uncertain business conditions, we are continuing to support customers and channel partners with inventory positions to push out their backlog. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the December quarter to be between down 15% and down 20% sequentially. At the midpoint of our net sales guidance for the December quarter, our year-over-year decline for the quarter would be 14.3%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 64% and 65% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 22.7% and 23.3% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 40.7% and 42.3% of sales and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.09 and $1.17 per share. Given the current macro weakness and resultant business uncertainty, combined with our lower bookings and reduce near-term visibility, we anticipate that our March quarter revenue is likely to decline again sequentially, although to a lesser extent than the December quarter decline. Notwithstanding any near-term macro weakness, we are confident that semiconductors remain the engine of innovation for the applications and markets we serve. Our focus on total system solutions and key market megatrends is fueling strong design win momentum that we expect will drive above-market long-term growth. If you review Microchip's speak to crop performance on a trailing 12-month basis, through the business cycles over the last 15-plus years which is included in the investor presentation posted on our website, you will observe our consistent and resilient cash generation gross margin and operating margin results. We remain confident that our non-GAAP operating margins on a trailing 12-month basis should remain above 40% through the business cycles. With that, let me pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to provide you with a further update on our cash return strategy. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 33.8% from the year ago quarter to $0.439 per share. During the last quarter, we purchased $339.8 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $222.8 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was a record $562.6 million. This amount was 72.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $776 million during the June 2023 quarter. Our net leverage at the end of September 2023 quarter was 1.28x. Ever since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $3.248 billion to shareholders in September 30, 2023, by a combination of dividends and buybacks. In the current December quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow from the September quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes a net $87.5 million that we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when first two commitments are fulfilled. The adjusted free cash flow for the September quarter was $454.3 million [ph]. We plan to return 77.5% or $352.1 million of that amount to our shareholders with the dividend expected to be approximately $237.5 million and the stock buyback expected to be approximately $114.6 million. Going forward, we plan to continue to increase free cash flow return to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders. That will take 5 more quarters and dividends over time, we expect will represent approximately 50% of our cash returned. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: I guess my first question is on the December quarter outlook. I think you gave a little bit of color by GEO but I was hoping you could provide a little bit of context by end market, if any of the end markets stand out [indiscernible] the downside or the upside? And is this mostly volume that's driving the sequential decline in revenue? Or are you starting to see pricing erode a little bit as well?
Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So firstly, there is no pricing that is driving the changes. It's all volume. The weakness is very broad-based across the different geographies, across the different end markets, with perhaps the one end market which continues to have reasonable resilience is aerospace and defense, as you might expect. But it's extremely broad-based at this point.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Eric on gross margin and I guess, utilization rates as well. How are your factories running today, both wafer processing and packaging and test? And as you continue to adjust to evolving demand environment, how should we see that impacting gross margins beyond the December quarter? How should we think about the trough?
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So on utilization, we have left the wafer fabs kind of reduced from where they were at the peak when they were running just full out and that has dropped modestly. We're still not in a situation where we are taking underutilization charges and that's not anticipated in the gross margin guidance that we've provided but they are running at lower levels and not as efficiently. On the assembly and test side, we definitely have reduced the activities in assembly and tests. We'd rather build the product through Dibang [ph] through the wafer fab and then have it ready when orders come in to be able to turn it quite quickly with short lead times to the assembly and test process. So the assembly and test is more kind of in line with where consumption is. We actually reduced finished goods last quarter and we'll continue to be very focused on that.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava: Ganesh, you mentioned cancellations in your prepared remarks and I just wanted to get -- if you could provide us with a little bit more details around that. This is the first time you mentioned that. And so what percentage is it of your orders. And then for you, is just starting the year-over-year decline which is kind of a related second part question is the typical cycle, I don't know, 5 to 7 quarters, year-over-year decline. What's your sense of how long does the year-over-year decline last, given the programs you have in place. Now if you look back, clearly, you were over shipping over the last few quarters. So color on both would be very helpful.
Ganesh Moorthy: So first of all, inside of 90 days, any orders that a customer has are cancelable. So that's our just standard tires. And then there are the longer-term non-cancelable orders that we have worked and we don't really work on cancellations there as much as rescheduling and pushing out where that backlog would be. A lot of the backlog that has been placed over the last many quarters were based on very long lead times and the conditions for the market for many of our customers have changed over that time. And so what they believe their businesses are going to do and what their businesses are doing today are a little bit different from when they place those orders. And that's where they're making adjustments to what they require. And if their run rates come down, then whatever units they have in inventory or they have placed on us are at a higher run rate than they really need. And that's what reflects some of the correction you're seeing to bring our shipments and the customer's inventory more on the line.
Ambrish Srivastava: And then the period of year-over-year declines on a -- if you just compare it to the last few cycles?
Ganesh Moorthy: Every cycle is different. I don't know about the year-over-year decline necessarily. But when you look at historically how cycles have played out. Typically, there's a 2-quarter, 3-quarter period of time over which the digestion of that inventory takes place. And upon that being completed, the consumption which is normally ahead of the shipments catch it back up and that's how the cycle gets reborn in what we have seen.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.
Gary Mobley: You commented in your prepared remarks that you expect a further sequential decrease in the March quarter. And I would assume that, that would come with perhaps some lower gross margin attached to it. And that puts you pretty close to that 40% op margin threshold without any OpEx adjustments. So maybe you can just speak to whether or not that lower revenue comes with lower gross margin. And as well, what sort of measures you'd be willing to take to make OpEx adjustments.
Ganesh Moorthy: So I think in any given quarter, as revenue declines, the operating margin had a very large change in revenue. It's not -- you can't draw a line and say, it will never fall below this line. We look at our operating margins on a trailing 12-month basis. That's what we've always had in terms of the data we've presented, the truck numbers that we have put out there. And we don't know exactly what the magnitude of what might take place in March is. But we're confident that if you look at a 4-quarter rolling or trailing 12 months, we will still be at that 40% trough as where we see it going.
Eric Bjornholt: I guess I would add to that is what investors and analysts have seen from Microchip over time when we face these cycles is we are pretty nimble and we adjust our business appropriately to the environment, whether that's on the expense side or if we need to do something with utilization. And right now, we're continuing to run the factories at a pretty high level but lower than they were before. And OpEx, we have some weathers that we can pull depending on what business environment we're going to be facing in March and beyond.
Gary Mobley: Okay. And the follow-up I want to ask about distribution inventory which was up sequentially. I know you don't really have a sense of how quickly they think is draining or the channel is draining [ph]. But maybe if you could just give us a sense of when you could get -- see that work down a bit?
Eric Bjornholt: So in terms of timing, some of that's going to be based on what the distributors want to take in terms of inventory. And then obviously, what the end market consumption is going to be. So it's hard to forecast. Our distributors are tasked with having the right level of inventory in place to support their customers and we will work with them to achieve that level. And just like customers, some distributors need inventory and some distributors are over inventory that are going to work through that and it takes some time. So don't have a specific way to answer your question but I imagine over the next couple of quarters that distribution inventory will get more rightsized to whatever the distributors think is the best place for them to be.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: [Indiscernible] made you a little different than your peers during the upturn was the PSP and your and CNRs. And the idea was that you don't just let customers push that out and push that out. But it does sound like that's actually what's happening. So are you sort of being a little more proactive about maybe cleaning that out and forcing them to come back and place new orders? And I'm just kind of wondering about the discussions that you're having with these customers that have been under these MCRs [ph].
Ganesh Moorthy: So this is not the first quarter in which we have been doing that. We have mentioned that at prior calls as well. When customers are trying to place orders further out in time, they do the best they can and that conditions change. We will have discussions with them to see what we can do to help and what they can do to help us in terms of what future business is and any business relationship that's give and take. And of course, we have done a significant amount of push-outs to help them out.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. And then Eric, can you give us an idea of inside of December, how much of the guidance depends on turns?
Eric Bjornholt: We do not break that out but it's a small number.
Timothy Arcuri: Small number. Okay.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes, I would say that we still have more backlog on our books in total than what would be typical for us but lead times down.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.
Vivek Arya: I had one on sales and one on gross margins. On the sales side, I think Ganesh mentioned that the March quarter could decline again. And I'm wondering if there is a conceptual way to size it? So let's say, if you assume that June and September have kind of been the peak of the cycle, you should be thinking, I don't know, 25% peak to trough that kind of smart sales down mid-single digit. Is that a reasonable way to think about -- just bigger picture, do you think 25% peak to trough is a reasonable expectation of decline in this cycle but what does history kind of tell us?
Ganesh Moorthy: Like the history is all over the place. And so it's unclear for us to be able to give you -- and especially when we have low visibility into the March quarter and we have a fair amount of turns to take in the March quarter itself. The business hasn't gone away. The customers haven't gone away. The designs haven't gone away. So we know they're all there. It's now a matter of where is the macro telling our customers what their bills should be, where is their inventory at and where they will be building to as they go into the March and June quarters for themselves. But at 17.5% in the December quarter, I think this is probably one of the larger declines historically from Microchip than the first quarter of the global financial crisis. So you can see there's a pretty big chunk that is taking place here in the December quarter.
Vivek Arya: Okay. On the gross margin side, I'm trying to get a sense of both the kind of the downside risk from here? And then whenever we get to back to kind of the revenue levels in the next cycle, will gross margins get back to prior levels? So on the downside, I think you're guiding gross margins down about 350 basis points. That's also below what we have seen in prior down cycles. Is there a way to think about what is the kind of the trough is potential level? I think, Eric, you mentioned you're still keeping utilization if I recall. So what happens if you have to start cutting them? So what's the downside risk? And then part B of that is, let's say we come back to these revenue levels sometimes, right? Over the next several quarters. Will gross margins get back to 68%? Or will it be different? Because the 68% right plus/minus was achieved during a period of very strong industry pricing and shortages.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. So there's a lot in that question and I wish I had a crystal ball to answer it specifically. But the bottom line is, as we -- as I said in my response before, we will adjust our operations based on the environment that we're faced with. And with needing quite a bit of turns in the March quarter at this point in time, with short lead times which again is not unusual but not something that we faced over the last couple of years, there is some uncertainty. But we have confidence in our business longer term. And the products that we build in our factories sell for years and years and years. So sometimes the offset between taking utilization down and then building the product and taking an inventory reserve charge for a period of time, those things can somewhat offset each other. So we'll evaluate that based on what we're facing when we get into March and beyond and adjust accordingly. But we fully expect our gross margins to stay strong. Yes, they are taking a drop this quarter but still exceptionally high gross margins. And I wouldn't expect a huge drop from where they're at. But again, that kind of depends on if the environment requires us to do something different. If there's something we aren't seeing at the moment, we'd evaluate that and share that with analysts and investors at that time. Ganesh, would you want to add anything at all of that?
Ganesh Moorthy: I would say if the revenue was back at the levels that we can a, I see no reason why our gross margin would be back to the levels that we are at.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg: I know this is a tricky one that we talk about over shipping and undershipping. Do you have a sense for what the true consumption is of your business at this point on a quarterly or annual basis?
Ganesh Moorthy: Hard question to come up with because our customer demand has also shifted over the last 6 months or so as they are trying to figure out where is the macro going and what is their real demand. And so I don't know if there's a clear number we could give you that says, this is what is consumption. But as we go through this correction, we believe we will be shipping under consumption but to what extent, I can't tell you.
Tore Svanberg: That's fair. And then moving on to the operating margin and not to sort of like focus on the math here but when you position as a trailing 12 month, I mean 1 quarter could be as low as 25%, right? So I'm just trying to understand just conceptually with your OpEx, how much variability do you have if we continue to see sequential declines in revenues?
Eric Bjornholt: So we have more flexibility in our OpEx compared to what we've guided the current quarter for. We are not ready to size that for the Street at this point in time. But as I said before, you guys have seen us work through cycles before. And if the cycle gives us something that's extreme to work with, we will take more measures in our business. That is not what we're hoping that we need to do but we do have levers that we can pull that we've pulled historically that if we're faced with a more difficult environment than we anticipate, OpEx can come down from what you're seeing here in our guidance for the current quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen.
Joshua Buchalter: I wanted to follow up on the utilization comments. So you mentioned matching utilizations to the business environment. But clearly, you're seeing weakness at your end customers. I guess what are the signals that would drive you to lower utilization? Like what are the -- what would you need to see? And then can you maybe expand a little bit more on the rationale behind keeping utilization high as you're trying to work through inventory, both on books and in the channel?
Eric Bjornholt: I'll start and Ganesh and/or Steve can add to this. But again, our products have very, very long life cycles. If we were to cut utilization in the factories significantly, there is a large portion of the cost that you can't take out because of the very heavy fixed cost environment. And so the balance does it make sense to build the inventory, have that higher inventory, have it available to support your customers when the business environment turns positive which it will. And that's kind of how we're managing it right now. Now, you can obviously get to a point where that inventory is too high and it doesn't make sense and we don't think that we're in that position today but we have let fab utilization fall from where it was and we'll continue to monitor it on a really a weekly, monthly basis and make decisions as we go.
Ganesh Moorthy: What I would add to it is ramping a fab after you take it down drastically, it takes time to get people hired, train, get the equipment and the remaining process work to be done takes time. So as we saw in 2021 and 2022, we put the foot on the accelerator but it took time to get the ramps going. So I think you want to be careful as you make some of those changes. And we are making small changes to get them to where we want to be. But because we have the good fortune of products with extremely long life cycles and all of the inventory is in good shape. And in fact, all that inventory allows us to do 2 great things. One, respond quickly when the business changes. And we know when it changes, it will change faster than we expect on the upside. And second, push the capital that is required to be deployed in order to generate those products further out in time. So I think it is a good asset utilization in terms of being able to be careful with how we take capacity down.
Joshua Buchalter: I appreciate all the color there. And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about pricing. I guess it's encouraging to hear pricing still hanging in but there's a big investor concern that it will roll over. Can you, I guess, provide some anecdotes or what do you think is allowing firmer pricing in past cycles, because that's what's allowing margins to hang in, I think, better than far given the top line but also a major concern for investors.
Ganesh Moorthy: The pricing on our product line which are long design cycles, very sticky product lines. In past cycles, there's never been something that rolled over, nor are we thrown to trying to use price as a way to leverage any short-term demand change because it doesn't help in where we're going. So our cycles of experience with how we have handled other cycles for pricing, plus where we are and how we're navigating this cycle. We don't feel price is a place where change is expected to happen.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities.
William Stein: Great. Guys, I know you're only guiding a quarter but you made this comment on March, I think about a sequential decline. By my math, I think typical seasonality is down at least a couple of percentage points. And just to help us sensitize our models, would you anticipate another, as you called it last time, I think, amplified or magnified seasonality in Q1? Or do you think it's possible that we're more like a normal seasonal result?
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, there's so little visibility that we can apply to any kind of intelligent answer at this point in time. We need to get further down the time to see how next quarter takes shape. And we're guiding to just one quarter -- the December quarter at this point in time. We've given you some directionally where our sense is for the March quarter but in terms of the magnitude, there's nothing that we can provide at this point that would be helpful.
William Stein: Understood. I have a follow-up, if I can. I'm hoping you can size for us the amount of sales in the December quarter that you anticipate will be filled as part of the PSP program. And similarly, how much PSP backlog you have after December still on the books? It just seems to me with lead times at 13 weeks going to -- I think you said 8. It's hard to imagine customers are lining up for that still.
Ganesh Moorthy: So you're right. PSP had a time when it was far more important for customers to be enrolled and to be taking advantage of that priority. As cycle times come down, there are fewer PSP orders that are needed for any customers. It's not that it's gone away. It's still there in a reasonable amount but it's typically the customers who are very long cycle in their design and very high value in their end products. Because quite honestly, there are many parts of the market that are concerned about what happens on the flip side of the cycle, whatever that is in the second half of '24, etcetera. So it's a customer choice. No customer has to use PSP unless they believe it provides them a tool. And we made adjustments to the program to give them more flexibility, have shorter amount of window of time, etcetera. And we'll continue to evolve the program. And if there's use for it, customers will take advantage of it. And if they want, if there isn't, then they won't.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi.
Chris Danely: Question on the geos, I guess. So in terms of all these cancellations and pushouts in the forecast, have any geographies fared any better or worse as we're going through this correction?
Ganesh Moorthy: No, because a lot of our customers can be in multiple geographies can be headquartered in the U.S. but manufacturing in a different geography. And so the intensity or the requirements for push out and help is -- has no geographic signal that would be different.
Chris Danely: Okay. Yes, I know you said North America was flattish in the previous quarter. I was wondering if anything was still holding up or worse. As my follow-up, so we've seen some of these internal China OEMs finally start to do their own analog or mixed signal chips. BYD doing their own BMS solution is one of them. And it seems like they don't really care about quality or cost or what have you. Can you give us a sense if you know of roughly how much of your business goes to domestic China? And do you see any risk that the non-China MCU business could kind of issues with this?
Ganesh Moorthy: So the proportion of what goes into China for China of a broad-based product line, I would say it's probably under 5-ish percent or in that range. I don't have an exact number, so don't hold me to that. The difference is that, this is not new that we have competition in China. The business is extremely fragmented. There's hundreds thousands customers and applications that are there. And so even previously, we would have had some designs where somebody didn't care about quality or didn't care about something else and said I'm just going to use this. And that's not unusual in where it happened. So it is something we are paying attention to but not something which is creating a dramatic change in the business itself.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with SIG.
Christopher Rolland: Can you guys talk about or give us a rough idea of what percent of bookings coming into any of these quarters are being pushed out each quarter? And is that representative basically of the December sequential drop that we're getting here? As you guys mentioned, like that you really didn't have any turns business into the quarter. And I think December has traditionally been somewhat flat. And are these levels of pushouts, are they increasing progressively as we move along here?
Ganesh Moorthy: So let me start and then Eric might want to chime in here as well. So firstly, new bookings are not the place where people are trying to push things out, because if they are new bookings within the last 3 to 6 months of time, those are with much more informed sense for demand, supply market, etcetera. A lot of the pushout requests for backlog that was placed 9, 12 or longer months where, as time has gone on, the need as they perceive this when they place the orders and the need as they see it today when they are facing the reality of what the markets have changed to, are different. So new bookings actually are in far better shape just because they are much more informed about current market conditions.
Eric Bjornholt: Right. Well, I guess what I would add to that is those new bookings have been pretty modest that have been coming in, right? So bookings have been lower. We don't break out a book-to-bill but bookings have been low. And the bottom line is, I think it's very difficult for customers to know what they need, particularly with those orders as Ganesh was saying they were placed 9 or 12 months ago. But we have had certain instances where customers have actually asked for a pushout and then the next month, they're coming back to us and asking for us to pull it in. So I think it's just a very uncertain environment at the customer level and obviously, that causes some churn on our backlog and the request that we get for push out activity.
Ganesh Moorthy: And they have a benefit today of knowing that supply is readily available, that lead times are short and they are taking advantage of that which would make sense.
Christopher Rolland: Yes, I think that's a great tie-in maybe to my next question. I guess with hindsight, how do you guys evaluate instituting that 12-month PSP was that a good thing, a bad thing? Would you do it again? And if so, were there any changes you would make?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's a question we ask ourself all the time. But I think you also have to look at not 12 months as a stand-alone piece of information, right? It is what were the lead times. So even if -- when lead times are 52 weeks, you really can't offer somebody something inside of that because there isn't -- all the capacity within that window is already consumed. So like all programs, they have to be designed with a sense of the information at a given point in time and they have to evolve as that information changes. And so even on PSP, right, it used to be 12 months. Today, 6 months. We made that change several months ago. The flexibilities, etcetera, around or have changed. And each program is designed to create a customer solution. And that solution has to be sensitive to what problem we're trying to solve at a given point in time. PSP was a fantastic program for '21 and '22 and parts of '23 when there was very long lead times, then the customers who participated got the most benefit from there. Today, it has less value when cycle -- when lead times come down dramatically and for other than a small set of customers, it is not as important to provide that much visibility.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. And I've said this to investors time and time again that if we had not had PSP, I am confident that our backlog would have been higher but we wouldn't have known what was good backlog and what was bad backlog and we would have made the wrong decisions in terms of foundry orders that we made, capital equipment that we are putting in place. And so the PSP program was designed in a way where we were trying to service customers in a very long lead time environment where we were capacity constrained and give the customer an option to do that but then have skin in the game also where just not all that risk sell on Microchip. So there's a lot of good things that came with PSP. Obviously, when the cycle changes, customers can feel differently about the backlog that they place than they did when they placed the order but there were a lot of happy customers that we serve us well because of the program.
Christopher Rolland: Makes sense.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.
Chris Caso: The question is on the cash return program and the buybacks and understand that the program is really meant to be formulaic. But the question is, is there any flexibility within that program to be more opportunistic at times like these? And obviously, you guys are still generating a good amount of cash but taking advantage when the downturn in the stock is down, have you contemplated that?
Ganesh Moorthy: Let me get it kicked off and I think Steve might want to weigh in here as well. So the program is something that the Board looks at on a constant basis. And there is nothing that would prevent us from doing something which is opportunistic for the right reasons, if the Board believes that's the right action for us. Steve, do you want to add to that?
Steve Sanghi: So while the main body of the program is formulaic, where we are increasing the cash return to shareholders by 500 basis points [ph] every quarter and increasing our dividend by about 7% or so every quarter and the remaining amount becomes the stock buyback, the program doesn't prohibit us from taking advantage of the environment where start gets into a severe downdraft for any reason. We can certainly have the cash resources on our credit line and all that to the forward buy the stock from the following quarter and then buy less than the following quarter. So we didn't stop us from doing that. We have not done that so far. I think stocks has been kind of reasonably constant in the range of between $70 and $90 but if there was to be a substantial opportunity at a lower stock price which was to emerge for any reason, then Microchip has the flexibility to do anything we wanted to do.
Ganesh Moorthy: And of course, we have the headroom and what's the approved buyback. There's over $2 billion of headroom available there and we have the headroom in our line of credit.
Chris Caso: Got it. That's helpful. As a follow-up, I just want to return to gross margin and the utilization. And I guess asking perhaps some of the questions that have been answered in a different way. Is there a particular level of inventory that would make you uncomfortable that would cause you to reduce the utilization? And I guess part of this depends upon somewhat the duration of the downturn, how long the downturn should last?
Eric Bjornholt: I think that's a key point to look at there because if you're looking at your inventory on a backward-looking basis or current quarter type basis and what that drives but you have confidence that 2 quarters, 3 quarters, 4 quarters, 6 quarters, whatever out in time that the business is going to go back and exceed prior highs, you're going to take a different action than if you think the business is in decline mode or in stagnant mode. So those are all the things that we need to evaluate when determining how we're going to run our factories and what's the right position for the inventory. And we've got our position today. And as I've said, we'll continue to evaluate that based on the environment that we see in front of us.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh: I was just wondering, is there like a target inventory level that you want to maintain? Or on the flip side of that is at what point do you start to [indiscernible] back utilization this?
Eric Bjornholt: So our target levels that we said at our Analyst and Investor Day back in November of 2021 was 130 to 150 days. We are obviously above those levels today and there's reasons for that. And I think some of your question I responded to in response to the credit question. So we're not uncomfortable with where the inventory is today, we're going to watch it closely depending on the environment and then it's going to be what the outlook is in terms of are we comfortable continuing to run the fabs at the levels that they're running at today or if we need to do something different. Not at that point today where we're going to do something different. Yes, inventory is above our target levels but I think we're managing it appropriately and we'll continue to do so.
Ganesh Moorthy: I would add that in steady state is where the 130 to 150 is where we want to be. If you look back at the last cycle, I think we were down like 108, 109 days and -- that was what it was in the place where demand was so high was depleting our inventory. Today, we're at 167, 10 days of that are really last time buys. So you take that out, we're around 157. So we're not dramatically outside of the steady-state range that we would need to be.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. No, the reason I ask is because the revenues [indiscernible] are down, the DOI might spike -- got it. And then as you look at the market conditions, can you talk to where the inventory levels are trending? And does that prompt -- are you seeing any pushback on pricing in the supply chain as supply comes on or has demand conditions soften a bit, if you can give some color on that?
Ganesh Moorthy: So firstly, we don't -- at our distributors, we have view into the inventory we have. At our customers, we use their requests for pushouts and all that as a proxy for understanding it. But customers have many business units, many product lines and they could be and certain product lines wanting to push out and other ones, they want to pull in. So it's all over the place. And there was a second part of your question.
Eric Bjornholt: Pricing. Wasn't quite sure if that was a customer pricing or a supplier pricing? Is it supply chain pricing or are customer pricing that you're asking about?
Vijay Rakesh: Your customer pricing in terms of -- as the market conditions change, as the supply improves, if inventory levels go up, is that now becoming a part of the discussion?
Ganesh Moorthy: All the purchasing managers are going to ask for a lower price in an environment that is softer. But these are products where the price elasticity isn't there where somehow if we put a lower price, we get more different this quarter or next quarter, etcetera. These are long design cycles. Prices have stepped 18, 24 or 36 [indiscernible] was at the point of designing and we will be competitive at the point where we do the design business. Business itself in the short term is not affected by the pricing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Maybe another one on just the inventories. Last quarter, you talked about the lower-than-expected sell-through in China which was largely responsible for the rising channel inventories in June? Or do I think days increased, I think it was 5 days back in June, days increased another 6 days here in the September quarter. Was this primarily continued disti [ph] sell-through weakness in China? Or was the pickup more pronounced in other geographies?
Eric Bjornholt: I'd say that [indiscernible] sell-through was not strong in any geography. So we did not see any significant improvement in distribution sell-through So...
Ganesh Moorthy: And China has continued to be weak. We have not seen the level of improvement we expected out of China and there's plenty of news information about what's happening from an economy standpoint here.
Harlan Sur: Ganesh, you talked about the relative strength in aerospace and defense. You've -- your data center and compute franchise, I think probably now it's about 20% [ph] of your business. Mix demand trends here as well but you guys are exposed to some of the stronger areas like accelerated compute? How is this end market trending for the team?
Ganesh Moorthy: So I think on data center, I think the last breakout there was about 17% or so in that range. But there are many subsegments that go into it. We clearly have a tailwind on anything and everything that goes into the artificial intelligence and the generative AI space, etcetera. But in terms of the volume that, that drives and the dollars that it drives, while it is meaningful, it's not big enough to offset some of the other weakness we have in other parts of data set.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore: Ganesh, you talked about every cycle being different in this cycle in the upturn, it seemed like the shortages were more severe. You did see prices go up more on a like-for-like basis and your margins got higher than we've seen before. So I guess as you think about the downturn, is that going to reverse? Or do you have a situation where there's more awareness of the supply chain people want to hold more inventory because of the intensity of the shortages? Can you just tell us like how the strength in the last couple of years might portend for the next couple of quarters?
Ganesh Moorthy: I think different customers have different levels of strategic versus tactical thinking. Last night, I have been with the CEO of one of our largest customers and extremely thoughtful about not just the next one quarter but about the next 3, 4 years of time and how they want to plan for it. I've also had similar discussions with people who were for 2 or 3 years suffering for with lack of product and all of a sudden they've forgotten about all the things that they need to be able to do. So it's all over the place and it really depends on what the pressure they're under. But for the most part, what we see is our customers or our customers' customers in many cases, who are people who build many of the high-value systems are much more thoughtful about how a small piece of the bill of material is not where they need to be able to make a saving, while they have substantial value that they're trying to create at the overall system. So there's no single answer because we serve 100,000 customers. It's all over the place. But without a doubt, short lead times are giving them more flexibility in terms of what are they trying to place on us and how much time do they need to give us in many cases.
Operator: And our next question will come again from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava: With a follow-up. I had a quick one for you, Eric. What's the target days of inventory for distributors?
Eric Bjornholt: So we don't really have a target. It's been all over the place historically. It's been as low as 17 days and it's been as high as, I think, is 47 in our history and probably as high as 41 over the last maybe 10, 12 years. So it's a broad range. And ultimately, it's the distributor's decision on the product that they purchase and how they support their customers. And obviously, they need a certain amount of inventory to effectively serve their customer base. And if they don't hold that inventory, the end customer will find another channel buy that product through. So we don't drive it to a certain number of days. I would not be surprised in the current environment that distributors with interest rates where they are, if they try to take their inventory down to some degree. But where that goes to, it's very hard for us to predict.
Ganesh Moorthy: If I can add to the distributor business over time has also changed. They do the warehousing services for many OEMs, where they actually carry in pipeline inventory for them. So they have programs that are not the traditional distribution where they are carrying the product and the turns rate is not the same when they are pipelining for very large OEMs. So inventory, as Eric said, something that each distributor has a model for what they're trying to accomplish and what they want and what they need is where they end up at.
Ambrish Srivastava: And your business has changed a lot also over the years, you have airspace. It depends what you don't have several years ago. So that's why I was asking. And I think you gave a helpful answer a little bit on the target of inventory days, Ganesh, that depend is also you're carrying at the end of life. So you're not that far out of the range on where you are versus your target shared at the Analyst Day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.
Ganesh Moorthy: Okay. I want to thank everybody for participating in the call today. And we do have many events that we will be at during the course of this quarter and we look forward to talking to you more at those events. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q1  (2023-08-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to today’s host Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer of Microchip. You may begin. 
Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon everybody. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2024 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results.  We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of our operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share based compensation and certain other adjustments that are described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliation on our website.  Net sales in the June quarter were $2.289 billion, which was up to 2.5% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference.  On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 68.4%, operating expenses were at 20.3% and operating income was a record 48.1%. Non-GAAP net income was $905.3 million and Non-GAAP earnings per share on a diluted basis was a record $1.64.  On a GAAP basis in the June quarter gross margins were a record at 68.1%. Total operating expenses were $655.3 million and included acquisition and tangible amortization of a $151.5 million, special charges of $1.7 million, share bases compensation of $37.7 million and a benefit of $0.4 million for other matters. GAAP net income was a record $666.4 million, resulting in a record $1.21 in per diluted share.  Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 14.2% in the June quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be about 14%, which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.  Our fiscal ‘24 cash tax rate is expected to be higher than our fiscal ‘23 tax rate for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes, such as net operating losses, tax credits, lower tax depreciation and our expectation for lower capital expenditures in the U.S. in fiscal ’24, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes.  We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. If that were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchips, non-GAAP tax rate in future periods.  Our inventory balance at June 30, 2023 was $1.336 billion. We had 167 days of inventory at the end of the June quarter, which was down two days from the prior quarter's level. Although we reduced inventory days in the quarter, we were not able to make as much progress as we would have liked to, as we accommodated requests by customers to push out delivery schedules for products that were very far through the manufacturing process.  We also continue to invest in building inventory for products with long lives and high margins, whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners, and these last-time buys represented eight days of inventory at the end of June.  We expect dollars and days of inventory on our balance sheet to reduce in the September quarter. Inventory at our distributors in the March quarter – excuse me, in the June quarter was at 29 days, which was up five days from the prior quarter's level. Compared to our other regions, inventory at our Asia distributors grew the most in the quarter, as sell-through activity was down significantly on a sequential basis in this region, heavily driven by unfavorable business conditions in China.  Our cash flow from operating activities was $993.2 million in the June quarter. Included in our cash flow from operating activities was $106.1 million of long-term supply assurance receipts from customers. We have adjusted these items out of our free cash flow to determine the adjusted free cash flow that we will return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as these supply assurance payments will be refundable over time, as purchase commitments are fulfilled.  Our adjusted free cash flow was $776 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $271.2 million. We paid down $413 million of total debt in the June quarter, and our net debt was reduced by $450.2 million.  Over the last 24 quarters, since we closed the Microsemi acquisition, and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $6.76 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt.  In the June quarter, we retired $1 billion in bonds that matured using our line of credit to do so. Our line of credit had $725 million of borrowings against it at June 30, 2023, after paying off the $1 billion in bonds. During the June quarter we also retired $38 million of total principal amounts of our 2025, 2027 and 2037 convertible bonds for a total cash payment of $90.1 million. The amount paid above the principal amount essentially works like a synthetic stock buyback, reducing any current and future share count dilution that will result if these convertible bonds were ever converted into shares.  The over $50 million we paid above the par value for the convertible bonds was in addition to our normal share buyback activity that we executed during the quarter, resulting in an additional reduction in the dilutive shares outstanding. Our adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was a record at $1.172 billion and 51.2% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $4.473 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was $1.29 at June 30, 2023, down from $1.45 at March 31, 2023, and down from $2.05 at June 30, 2022. Capital expenditures were $111.1 million in the June quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 is between $300 million and $400 million, as we still have a lot of equipment that was ordered with long lead times that we will be receiving over the next year. We expect that our capital investments will continue to provide us with increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $50.5 million.  I will now turn it over to Ganesh, to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter, as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Ganesh? 
Ganesh Moorthy : Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon everyone. Our June quarter results were strong in the context of a slowing macro environment, marked by our continued disciplined execution, as well as our resilient end markets and diversified customer base.  Net sales grew 2.5% sequentially and 16.6% on a year-over-year basis to achieve another all-time record of $2.29 billion. The June quarter represented our 11th consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. Non-GAAP gross and operating margins were both records at 68.4% and 48.1% respectively. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.64 per share, another record by a whisker and up 19.7% from the year-ago quarter.  Adjusted EBITDA was a record 51.2% of net sales and adjusted free cash flow was 33.9% of net sales in the June quarter, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation characteristics of our business.  Our net leverage exiting June dropped to 1.29x. We returned $349.2 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in the June quarter, representing 67.5% of our March quarter adjusted free cash flow. Our capital return to shareholders in the September quarter will increase to 72.5% of our June quarter adjusted free cash flow, as we continue on our path to return 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter of calendar year 2025.  My profuse thanks to all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding results despite the increasingly challenging macro environment, and especially to the worldwide Microchip team whose tireless efforts and agility to adapt are what enable us to navigate effectively through the business cycles.  Taking a look at our June quarter net sales from a product line perspective, our mixed signal microcontroller net sales set another all-time record, coming in sequentially up 0.8% in the June quarter and up 22.5% on a year-over-year basis. Our analog net sales also set another all-time record, coming in sequentially up 2.5% in the June quarter and up 9.2% on a year-over-year basis. Our FPGA net sales, which we comment on from time-to-time, had another record quarter with annualized revenue growth continuing to be in the double digits.  Now for some color on the June quarter. While our overall business remains steady, our customers continue to feel the effects of slowing economic activity and increasing business uncertainty. Starting in early June, we saw business conditions deteriorate in three areas.  First, our China business was much weaker than our expectations and has not recovered from the shutdowns of last year and the Lunar New Year holidays in the March quarter. This manifested in weak sell-through activity and the building of inventory in the distribution channel in China.  Second, we started to see initial signs of weakness and uncertainty in the automotive and industrial segments, reflecting the impact of high inflation and high interest rates driving more cautious spending.  And third, we are seeing early signs of an impending slowdown in Europe, exacerbated by some of our European customers being dependent on exports to countries like China, whereas we know that the business environment is much weaker than expected.  As a result, we continue to receive requests to push out or cancel backlog as customers start to rebalance their inventory in light of the weaker business conditions and increased uncertainty they were experiencing. We were able to push out meaningful amounts of non-reschedulable backlog to later quarters to help many customers with inventory positions.  While the rate of cancellation and push-out requests appears to be stabilizing, we expect request to push out or cancel backlog will likely be with us through the rest of calendar 2023, as customers adjust to their new demand environment and attempt to de-risk their inventory position commensurately.  We are also seeing an increasing direct and indirect impact from the cumulative effect of U.S. export control actions, especially in China. These actions were less of an issue over the last few quarters when demand was significantly higher than supply, but are more of an issue now as demand and supply come more into balance.  Despite all the factors mentioned so far, in the June quarter we were able to reverse the growth in days of inventory on our balance sheet, with inventory dropping by two days to 167 days, of which, eight days of inventory were from an investment in last-time buys of high-margin, long-lived products whose manufacturing capacity was being end of life by our supply chain.  Reflecting the slowing macro-environment, especially in China, our channel inventory grew by 5 days to 29 days. We continue to take actions to further reduce the days of inventory on our balance sheet, while maintaining absorption in our internal wafer fabrication factories. We're also working with our channel partners to find the right balance of inventory required to serve customers and to be positioned for an eventual strengthening of business conditions.  Finally, while our overall inventory is still a bit higher than our target, we made excellent progress to position our inventory at the best locations in manufacturing to be able to rapidly respond to demand growth when the macro environment strengthens.  Consistent with the slowing macro environment and the higher than target level of inventory on our balance sheet, as well as with some of our customers and channel partners, most of our internal factory expansion actions remain paused. This we expect will result in lower capital investments in fiscal year ‘24 and fiscal year ‘25.  During a period of macro weakness and business uncertainty, we believe shorter lead times are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully, and improve the quality of backlog placed on us. We have been able to reduce average lead time from roughly 52 weeks at the start of 2023 to roughly 26 weeks by the end of the June quarter, and we expect to continue to drive lead times down farther in the coming months.  We have heard concerns from some of the investment community about falling lead times, because it results in lower backlog. While this is often true, we believe the level of backlog does not equate to true end market consumption. And in the final analysis, shorter lead times enable our customers and Microchip to navigate an uncertain environment with agility and more effectively.  So now let's get into the guidance for the September quarter. Although our backlog for the September quarter is strong, we are continuing to take active steps to help customers with inventory positions to push out their backlog. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the September quarter to be between up 1% and down 3% sequentially. At the midpoint of our net sales guidance for the September quarter, our year-over-year growth for the quarter would be 9.3%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 68.3% and 68.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 20.1% and 20.5% of sales.  We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 47.8% and 48.4% of sales and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.60 and $1.64. At the midpoint of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, our year-over-year growth for the September quarter would be 11% despite a much higher tax rate than the year-ago quarter.  As supply and demand come into balance, we expect normal seasonality to return to our business. Historically, the December quarter has been our seasonally weakest quarter. This year, we expect that our normal seasonality in the December quarter will likely be amplified by the macro weakness and business uncertainty that our customers are experiencing.  As a result, we anticipate further business headwinds in the December quarter. However, notwithstanding any near-term macro weakness, we are confident that semiconductors remain the engine of innovation for the markets and applications we serve. Our focus on total system solutions and key market megatrends continues to fuel strong design momentum, which we expect will drive above-market long-term growth.  Finally, as you can see from our June quarter results and our September quarter guidance, our Microchip 3.0 strategy which we launched 21 months ago, continues to be the foundation of our results, as we continue to build and improve what we believe is one of the most diversified, defensible, high-growth, high-margin, high-cash generating businesses in the semiconductor industry.  However, we recognize that we operate in a cyclical industry and that we're not immune to the business cycles. If you review Microchip's peak to trough performance through the business cycles over the last 15-plus years, which is included in the investor presentation posted on our website, you will observe our robust and consistent cash-generation, gross margin and operating margin results.  Although we don't know what exactly the future holds, if we were to experience a semiconductor inventory correction like what the industry has seen in the past, we are highly confident that our non-GAAP operating margins would remain well above 40%, and we expect our cash-generation, non-GAAP gross margin, and non-GAAP operating margin to once again demonstrate consistency and resiliency through the cycle.  And with that, let me pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve. 
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy.  Reflective on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter while making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non-GAAP EPS and record adjusted EBITDA, and all of that in a continuing challenging environment.  The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 36.2% from the year ago quarter to $0.41 per share. During the last quarter we purchased $140.3 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $208.9 million in dividends, thus the total cash return was $349.2 million. This amount was 67.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $517.3 million during the March 2023 quarter. Our pay down of debt, as well as record adjusted EBITDA, drove down a net leverage at the end of June 2023 quarter to 1.29x from 2.05x at the end of June 2022.  Ever since we achieved an investment great rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $2.686 billion to shareholders through June 30, 2023 by a combination of dividends and stock buybacks.  In the current September quarter we will use the adjusted free cash flow from the June quarter to target the cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes a net $106.1 million that we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when purchase commitments are fulfilled.  The adjusted free cash flow for the June quarter was $776 million. We plan to return 72.5% or $562.6 million of that amount to our shareholders with the dividend expected to be approximately $223 million and the stock buyback expected to be approximately $339.6 million.  Going forward, we plan to continue to increase free cash flow return to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of our adjusted free cash flow return to shareholders. This will take six more quarters, and dividends over time we expect will represent approximately 50% of our cash returned.  With that operator will you please poll for questions? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is going to come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open. 
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your orders. I mean up backlog and the backlog that will make sense, but I was just wondering if you could update us on orders especially by region, and are you seeing any sort of signs of life at all from China, because obviously they are trying to stimulate the economy and just wondering if you’ve seen any data points there at all. 
Ganesh Moorthy: I think going through the month of July, we have not yet seen China recover. There are discussions I understand about things they may do in the rest of this quarter, those have to be seen. So I don't have anything more to add with respect to China.  Our bookings have been weak. We do expect in time that those will begin to strengthen. There is still a lot of backlog that we are carrying and we are pushing out backlog. So there is not an immediate requirement for bookings to spring back to where they used to be. 
Tore Svanberg: Perfect. Thank you. 
Ganesh Moorthy: You’re welcome. 
Eric Bjornholt: Maybe I can just add to that. You know bookings are a reflection of where lead times are and with lead times coming down, the customers just aren't viewing that they need to put the backlog in place, because our lead times are falling pretty rapidly. 
Tore Svanberg: Make sense. Thank you, Eric.
Operator: Our next question is going to come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open. 
Vijay Rakesh : Yes, hi. Just a quick question. I was wondering, when you look at your supply chain, where are you seeing any – what are you seeing on the pricing side if you were to look at China or just globally? 
Ganesh Moorthy: You know, supply chains are stable in most places where we buy wafers from, where we buy some of our assembly and test services from. Clearly, on some of the materials, there may have been some movement in certain cases. I don't think we track it at the level that perhaps you may be interested in. But I would say supply chains are stable, lead times have come down, we’re able to get what we need. 
Vijay Rakesh : Got it. And in general, if you look at trends as you look out on the pricing side, any thoughts you could share? I mean, what has been trends and what have you seen in the last two, three years and how you see that going forward, I guess. That's it, thanks a lot. 
Ganesh Moorthy: In our business, for the embedded solutions business, pricing tends to be a lot more stable. Pricing is something you establish at the point of doing your new design and activity, not at the point at which you're fulfilling demand that's coming in.  And outside of the last two years where there was significant inflation that we faced and that we passed on to our customers, pricing is usually relatively stable over time. We're not looking to reduce pricing or to increase pricing. And as we go forward, I don't expect that it's going to change in the way that our business runs. 
Vijay Rakesh : All right, thank you. 
Eric Bjornholt: You’re welcome.
Operator: Our next question is going to come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. You're in line as open. 
Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Sort of a multi-part, but related Ganesh. When I look at the September quarter outlook, it's kind of flattish, even though you're describing the situation at getting somewhat tougher.  And then as I look out to the December quarter, I think you mentioned it could be worse than seasonal. But even with the headwinds, do you see a scenario where Microchip could continue to grow year-on-year or you think we should be thinking about, the first quarter of year-on-year declines. And if they were to, right, decline year-on-year, what would be the effect on gross margins? 
Ganesh Moorthy: We haven't modeled what the December quarter nor are we guiding to what the December quarter is going to be. There are a range of scenarios that we are working with, and I don't really have any more color to offer on it.  With respect to the gross margins, as we have said many times, we have a pretty strong resilience to the way the gross margin works. If you look at our inside-outside mix, we still have a 60% outside mix. We are continuing to run our fact, where for absorption purposes we are building the product that we need to build and building some inventory.  So really, I'm not trying to provide any guidance for December that you might have, but you're absolutely right. We are expecting that the December quarter is going to be weaker than normal seasonality. 
Vivek Arya : Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question is going to come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. 
Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about automotive and industrial. Industrial has weakened for some of the competitors for quite a few quarters, and auto's continues to be strong, you know more or less, although the growth rate seems to be descending.  What's your take on having these for several cycles? We just started here and lead times on our contracting. So how many quarters do you think the weakness in auto, and to that matter industry for your business we should expect loss? 
Ganesh Moorthy: You know, it's very difficult for me to answer that question. There is that question of, which part of this is just inventory digestion that's taking place. And how much of it is consumption changes and how consumptions changes might change? So just using China as the example, China consumption was weak or weaker than anyone expected in the June quarter. Now, how does it come back in the September or December quarters is anybody's guess and where it's at. So I don't have a clear view of how long does automotive or industrial stay weak. We've gone through many cycles. They don't last forever obviously, and there are some typical cycles you can look back on and see how they perform. 
Ambrish Srivastava : Well, it's true. I just had a quick follow-up, Ganesh. I'm struggling with the R part of the NCNRs. What's the learning here? Has it allowed you to reduce the volatility that usually used to occur when we were going into a downturn, because you keep rescheduling these. I shouldn't say keep. A couple of quarters you rescheduled these, and you expect another reschedule next quarter. What's the right way investors should think about this? Because we've seen NCNRs by many companies improve, and so I don't know what's the learning from this. 
A - Ganesh Moorthy: Well, the purpose of the NCNR was to get a mutual commitment of investment we were going to make and benefit a customer was going to get. It's based on a set of assumptions about where business is going to go, and I think as lead times go farther and farther out, everybody's visibility gets to be less clear.  And the vast majority of the customers who were part of the NCNR programs have been extremely happy with what they were able to get in an extremely different environment in 2021 and 2022.  You know, no program is perfect. I believe that our programs have had substantially more benefit than issues with them. We are at a point of the cycle where the demand curve has changed, and as that demand curve changes, we have to adjust. And by the way, the same demand curve will change again as we go into 2024. So I think we have to look beyond the short-term view of where this all ends up and look at how do these programs provide mutual benefit in the medium to long term. 
Ambrish Srivastava : Makes sense. Thank you. 
A - Ganesh Moorthy: You're welcome. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley, your line is open. 
Joe Moore : Great. Thank you, guys. I guess you're describing an environment in which you're seeing weakness in multiple regions, weakness in multiple end markets, and you're characterizing that as kind of early signs of that, and yet you're only guiding down 1% quarter-on-quarter. So I guess its like, do you have a level of demand that's lower than this? I mean, you have a lot of backlog right now. What happens as that backlog runs out. Can you just give us a sense for what type of drawdown we might be looking at over the course of the next few quarters? Just anything qualitative you can help, so that would be great. 
A - Ganesh Moorthy: We’re calling it as we see it. We've given you a guidance for September quarter that brackets between plus one and minus three, and that reflects what we see today in our backlog and what we see in the tone of the business. We're giving you a sense that the December quarter is going to be seasonally weaker than normal. And again, it has a number of puts and takes that could go into it. I don't know what more I can say, Joe. It's the best that we're able to peer into the future and provide some insight as to where we think business is going. 
Joe Moore : I can appreciate that. Thank you. And then, in terms of the 40% operating margin, can you give us a sense for what the parameters are of that? Like how much – you know, is that kind of a normal revenue weakness that you might have seen two or three years ago? Could you still do a north of 40% if it's worse than that? Can you just give us a sense for your confidence in the durability of that number? 
Ganesh Moorthy: Our confidence is pretty high. We have looked at a number of scenarios. We've looked at how other cycles have gone, and I think we'll be well above 40% in the way that we have modeled it in the different scenarios that we have brought. Eric, do you want to add more to it? 
A - Eric Bjornholt: Yes, I think you've summed it up well Ganesh. We've done scenario planning and do not see a scenario where our operating margins on a non-GAAP basis could fall below 40%. So we're very comfortable in making that statement.  Maybe the other piece that I would add to Ganesh's first response is, I think it's a little bit tricky for investors to understand what is normal seasonality for microchip, because the supply constraints have been under for the last couple of years now, they did play a part in that, and then we've done a lot of acquisitions historically, right? But we would say that probably a normal December seasonal might be down 3% or 4%.  So hopefully that provides some context, and we're saying that based on the conditions that we're seeing, it you know likely could be – what's the word, Ganesh? [Cross Talk] yes, amplified. 
Joe Moore : Great. Thanks so much for your candor. Much appreciated. 
Operator: Our next question is going to come from Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Your line is open. 
Joshua Buchalter: Hey guys. Thank you for taking my question. In the past you've sort of given us rough levels of where you expected inventory to come in in the quarter. I guess given we're going through this digestion period, can you give us any level that you would feel comfortable with? What sort of targets are you thinking about for on-books and in the channel when you would feel more comfortable that you're shipping closer to end demand? Thank you. 
Ganesh Moorthy: You know, I think the channel inventory is driven by in part what the channel wants to carry, what we can supply, and what their demand intensity is. So we don't try to guide where's the channel inventory going to go. It goes where it goes based on those factors.  We do take a lot of effort on the internal inventory inside microchip and we have an added factor at this point, which is we are customers who have inventory positions and are looking for push-out help. And that has caused us to go slower than we would normally have liked, but it's the right long-term answer for us and for our customers. And we do expect as Eric said, to have both, a reduction in absolute and days of inventory on our balance sheet in the September quarter. 
Joshua Buchalter: I appreciate the color there. As my follow-up, I mean given that dynamic, your gross margin suggests that there's no real material cut, at least on your internal utilization rates. Can you talk about how you're thinking about running your factory through this period of digestion, and then I guess the same question for your foundry partners as well. Thank you. 
A - Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So, our internal fabs are continuing to run relatively unchanged. These products are very long-lived products. In many cases had been depleted in the inventory points that we typically need to be able to serve at a high level of certainty, as well as the lead time we want. So our internal factories and the internal fabs in particular are continuing to run.  And our foundry partners, depending on where the inventory levels were, in some cases, we will be adjusting and have adjusted the purchasing to bring that inventory into line with where we want to be long-term. 
Joshua Buchalter: Thank you. 
A - Ganesh Moorthy: You're welcome. 
Operator: Our next question is going to come from Chris Caso with Wolf Research. Your line is open. 
Chris Caso: Yes. Good evening, thank you. First question is about, I guess something we haven't spoken about in a while, a potential for the requirement for turns. And can you speak about that, given the reduction in lead times, the fact that customers are booking closer in? Are we in a situation… [Audio Gap]
A - Ganesh Moorthy: Chris, we may have lost you. Can you hear us? 
Operator: It looks like this is line hijacked. So, until he calls back, we'll just move on to the next person in queue. And that's going to be Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: Hi, Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You know, the team had a target to get average lead times down to 26 weeks in the second half. I mean you're there now given the scheduling activity and the near-term demand weakness, improving boundary capacity, right?  I think normal average, historical lead times for you guys have been in that eight to 12-week range. Is this that kind of a range that you expect as you move to the second half of the year now? And just a quick follow-up, do you guys expect to see your channel distribution inventories continue to rise from the 29-day level in this weak environment? 
A - Ganesh Moorthy: So first, to take the lead times. You know, we are continuing to drive lead times down. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we believe that short lead times is what makes us all effective and agile in an unpredictable business environment that we're in. And we're, on average, at just under 26 weeks right now. I think we will end the year at well under 13 weeks. It could be under 10 weeks by that time, but we'll know how we progress in that time. Four to eight weeks is where our lead times are for 90% or so of our line items as a historical benchmark for where we were.  With respect to distribution inventory, as I mentioned a little earlier on, it has many functions. It's a function of what kind of sell-through are they seeing? What kind of inventory do they want to carry? What are we able to supply, that maybe they've been asking for some time to be able to do it? So, I don't have any color on what distribution inventory is likely to be doing, you know outside of what we've provided so far for June. 
Harlan Sur: Okay. Thanks, Ganesh. 
A - Ganesh Moorthy: Welcome. Thanks Harlan. Chris, are you back? 
Operator: Yes. Chris Caso, your line is open again. 
Chris Caso : Yes. Not sure what happened, but thank you. So, the question was on the terms environment. Yes, obviously you haven't seen turns in several quarters given the high backlog. Is that something you contemplate either for the September quarter and December quarter? And can you tell us how you're thinking about that returns business under the context of shortening lead time?
A - Ganesh Moorthy: Yes, we certainly expect that turns will be a requirement as we go into the December quarter. And then also, the normal part of the business that we have done right, and so most things are starting to normalize again with respect to lead times, what kind of backlog coverage we'll have and turns is just something else we'll have to manage as we normally do, starting from the December quarter onwards. 
Chris Caso : Okay. But it starts in December, not in September? 
A - Ganesh Moorthy: There may have been small parts in the September quarter. I mean we're one-third of the way in through the September quarter. 
Chris Caso : Right, right, that's helpful. As a follow-up, I wonder if you could expand on some of the comments about Europe. And we heard from various others in the industry, you know obviously we can say about China, you know there's been a bit here and there about industrial and auto, but really not any comments about Europe, that's something new, and if you could expand upon what you're seeing there. 
A - Ganesh Moorthy: Yes, as I mentioned, I think Europe is more – as I look forward, there are more headwinds that European economies are facing. I believe technically Germany is now in a recession. It's had two consecutive quarters of negative GDP and interest rates are still high, inflation is still high. There's energy inflation, which is larger than in the U.S. and some of the large European economies rely on export, China being one.  To the extent China is weak, we're going to see some of that weakness in China, but we'll also see some of the weakness in Europe, when their exports are not quite realized. That's the addition of all of what we see as we look into where are things going, and the impact from Europe. 
Chris Caso : Got it. It’s helpful. Thank you and thank you for coming back to my question. 
A - Ganesh Moorthy: You're welcome. Thanks Chris and welcome back. 
Operator: Our next question is going to come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. 
Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. I had a question on cancellations. And in the past or you know, you've been working with customers on – allowing push outs. But in the past, you've sort of – you know, you've been offering customers to cancel for a fee. So if you want to bring down backlog, are you sort of increasingly forcing cancellation versus just allowing customers to push out shipments? I guess if you want to bring down backlog, one quick way to do that, force them to cancel versus just allowing them to push things out. Thanks. 
A - Ganesh Moorthy: You know, we're not intentionally trying to bring backlog down. We are trying to help customers who have backlog placed on us, but would prefer to receive it, in some cases, later than what it’s presently scheduled for. Backlog will – over time has been coming down, as the fever of what was in 2022 and 2021, where people are placing huge amounts of backlog out in time.  It starts to settle out, especially at these time are starting to come in. As the industry starts to normalize, backlog will get back to what it used to be normally, pre-COVID, and so that's really what's happening with backlog. We're not trying to force it down in any way. 
Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. And then just as a quick follow-up, in China – do you think any of the weakness in China – are you seeing examples of locally sourced product that you're being displaced by? I know that you don't have very much exposure there. If you net out the proprietary stuff, it's probably only 5% that's kind of subject to some sort of going local, but are you seeing any of that? Thanks. 
A - Ganesh Moorthy: In fact, it's a timely question. We just had a review with our China team here yesterday on exactly that topic, and there is little to no loss to the local China producers that we're able to see, either in design or in things that are in production today.  So no, it is actual consumption that is weak. There is a lot of uncertainty in China with respect to what the amount of debt people are carrying are, what kind of stimulus is going to take place. And I think there is a consumption that is waiting to happen, and I hope it will open up at some point in time. But at the moment, I think things are uncertain enough that consumption is being held down. 
Timothy Arcuri : Thank you so much. Thanks. 
Ganesh Moorthy: Welcome. 
Operator: Our next question is going to come from William Stein with Truist. Your line is open. 
William Stein : Great. Thank you. I wanted to address the similar question about cancellations that we understand with the PSP and the NCNRs, you've been much more flexible, at least somewhat flexible on rescheduling, but much less so on cancelling, which I think we all respect. But when we look at the growth rates of a wide variety of competitors, they've seen this downturn.
Operator: Okay, William Stein's line has disconnected as well. So, our next question is going to come from Janet Ramkissoon with Quadra Capital. Your line is open.
Janet Ramkissoon: Hi Steve, Ganesh. There’s somewhat of a different tone for this question. Could you provide a little bit of color on your efforts with the RISC-V and the PolarFire SoC FPGA program? Anything you could share with us about design-win activity and markets where you're gaining traction with this program? And any sense of when we're likely to see any real revenue growth from this area? My understanding is that there's a lot of interest in RISC-V for embedded applications. 
Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. Thank you, Janet. So, we were among the very early proponent of using RISC-V for our FPGA solutions as you mentioned. Those products have been in production. They are ramping. In fact, the PolarFire family as you mentioned it, it's the fastest-growing FPGA that we have, if you look like-for-like, what is it doing after X amount of quarters and where it's at. It is winning in the traditional markets that FPGA, that came to us from Microsemi was winning, which is in aerospace and defense, some in the communication space. But also increasingly it is winning quite significantly in industrial, and it is winning in some automotive applications as well. So quite broadly present, it is doing exceedingly well. It is contributing to the results that we have been quoting on FPGA, both last quarter for the fiscal year and this quarter to reflect that it is hitting new records every quarter, and we are very, very optimistic about how RISC-V based FPGAs, along with all of the other elements that we have integrated on the solution, is going to play out. And it will be a huge growth driver for Microchip. 
Steve Sanghi : Good to hear from you Janet. This is Steve. 
Janet Ramkissoon: Hi. Nice to hear from you Steve. But just one quick follow-up if I may. Given the capability that is made possible by this new architecture, and its ability to integrate analog and digital functionality in a very effective way, shouldn't this also be, have positive implications for gross margins on these products above corporate average? 
Ganesh Moorthy: So, I wouldn't place the RISC-V architecture as the reason for the gross margin or the performance of the product line. The product line is an enormously complex product. It comes with lots of software, lots of tools, a lot of application information that we put together. How we put it all together and turn it from a complex capability to an easy-to-use solution is what determines design wins, revenue growth, gross margins, customer adoption, etcetera. So it’s much, much more than anything about RISC-V alone or any other core for that matter.
Steve Sanghi : The product line's gross margins are definitely well above corporate average, but as Ganesh said, they are not because of the RISC-V. It's because of the overall architecture of the FPGA, the tools, the value we provide, and the markets we sell into. 
Janet Ramkissoon: Thanks very much guys. I appreciate it. 
Ganesh Moorthy: Great. You're welcome.  Were we able to get Will back? 
Operator: Yes. William Stein, your line is open again. 
William Stein : Great. I'll try to do a shorter preamble and just say, Microchip is clearly experiencing this down cycle later than others. I think it's pretty clear it's because you've had these – the PSP and other flavors of NCNR, and you've been clear that you're allowing customers to reschedule and not so flexible on the cancellations. If we look at number guidance, I'm guessing that if you told every customer that wanted to reschedule or cancel, no, then you would have had higher revenue or had higher guidance. Likewise, if you allowed everyone to... 
Operator: Unfortunately, it looks like his line has dropped again. 
Steve Sanghi : We have no idea why the lines are dropping. Will can just call us back after the call, and we'll take his question. 
Ganesh Moorthy: Where there other questions or other callers that are still in the queue? 
Operator: No, there are no more questions in queue. 
Steve Sanghi : Close it out then. 
Ganesh Moorthy: Okay. Well, thank you everyone for attending today and for your questions. And we have follow-up meetings with many of you as well. But I look forward to talking to you either at those calls or in the many events we will be at during the course of this quarter. So, thank you.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-05-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Microchip Technology's [Q3] and FY2023 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce to your host, Mr. Eric Bjornholt, Senior Vice President and CFO. Thank you, and you may proceed, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. I wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. And Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also identified and posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliations on our website. Net sales in the March quarter were $2.233 billion, which was up 2.9%, sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 68.3%, operating expenses were 20.7% and operating income was a record 47.65%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $907.8 million, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.64 and a penny above the high-end of our guidance range. On a GAAP basis in the March quarter, gross margins were a record at 68%. Total operating expenses were $671.3 million, and included acquisition intangible amortization of $167.4 million, special charges of $2.1 million, $2.3 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $37.8 million. GAAP net income was a record $604 million resulting in a record $1.09 in earnings per diluted share. As compared to a year-ago quarter, our March quarter GAAP tax expense was adversely impacted by a variety of factors. Notably, the tax expense recorded as a result of the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. For fiscal year 2023, net sales were a record $8.439 billion and were up 23.7% from net sales in fiscal year 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 67.8%, operating expenses were 20.9% of sales and operating income was a record 46.9% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was a record $3.353 billion and EPS was a record at $6.02 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, gross margins were also a record at 67.5%, operating expenses were 30.6% of sales and operating income was 36.9% of sales. Net income was $2.238 billion, and EPS was $4.02 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 10.8% in the March quarter and 10.9% for fiscal year 2023. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be about 14%, which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes occurred in prior fiscal years. Our fiscal 2024 cash tax rate is expected to be higher than our fiscal 2023 tax rate for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attribute such as net operating losses and tax credits, lower tax depreciation with our expectation for lower capital expenditures in the U.S. in fiscal 2024, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchip's non-GAAP tax rate in future periods. Our inventory balance at March 31, 2023 was $1.325 billion. We had 169 days of inventory as at the end of the March quarter, which was up 17 days from the prior quarter’s level. We have increased our raw materials inventory to help protect our internal manufacturing supply lines. We are carrying higher work in progress to help maximize the utilization of constrained equipment as well as to position ourselves to take advantage of new equipment installations, which should relieve bottlenecks. In certain circumstances, we have allowed customers to push out delivery schedules for products that were very far through the manufacturing process. We are investing in building inventory for long-lived high margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners, and these last time buys represented about seven days of inventory at the end of March. We feel that we need to take actions to help ensure that our supply lines can feed our growth beyond what we expect in the June 2023 quarter. We are targeting actions to reduce our inventory down between five and 10 days in the June quarter. Inventory at our distributors in the March quarter was at 24 days, which was up two days from the prior quarter’s level. Our cash flow from operating activities was $709.5 million in the March quarter. Included in our cash flow from operating activities was a net $79.5 million of long-term supply assurance receipts from customers and suppliers. We are going to adjust these items out of our free cash flow to determine the adjusted free cash flow that we will return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases as these payments will be refundable over time as purchase commitments are fulfilled. Our adjusted free cash flow was $517.3 million in the March quarter and was adversely impacted by our working capital investments this quarter, including $158.4 million increase in inventory and $130.3 million increase in accounts receivable, which we do not expect to repeat in the June quarter. As of March 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $234 million. We paid down $153 million of total debt in the March quarter, and our net debt was reduced by $98.1 million. Over the last 19 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion of debt to do so, we have now paid down $6.35 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt. Our adjusted EBITDA on the March quarter was a record at $1.139 billion and 51% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $4.288 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.45 at March 31, 2023 down from 1.56 at December 31, 2022, and down from 2.32 at March 31, 2022. Getting our net leverage below 1.5 is significant milestone for Microchip on its capital returns earning, which Steve will talk about shortly. Capital expenditures were $112.7 million on the March quarter and $486.2 million for fiscal year 2023. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 is between $300 million and $400 million as we still have a lot of equipment that was ordered with long lead times that will be received over the next year. We expect better capital investments will continue to provide us with increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $54.1 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter as well as our guidance for the June quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter results were strong in the context of a slowing macro environment marked by our continued disciplined execution as well as our resilient to end market. Net sales grew 2.9% sequentially and 21.1% on a year-over-year basis to achieve another all-time record at $2.23 billion. The March quarter represented our 10th consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Non-GAAP gross margin came in at the high-end of our guidance at a record 68.3%, up 171 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin also came in close to the high-end of our guidance at a record 47.65%, up 292 basis points from the year-ago quarter. We continued to make investments that we expect to drive the long-term revenue growth, profitability, and durability of our business. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was above the high-end of our guidance at a record $1.64 per share, up 21.5% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was 51% of net sales and adjusted free cash flow was 23.2% of net sales in the March quarter, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation characteristics of our business. We returned $469.9 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in the March quarter, representing 62.5% of our December quarter adjusted free cash flow. Our net leverage exiting March dropped to 1.45x. And as we do mentioned quarter ago, our capital returns this quarter will increase to 67.5% of our March quarter adjusted free cash flow, as we continue on our plan to return a 100% of adjusted free cash flow by the March quarter of calendar year 2025. Reflecting on our fiscal year 2023 results, it was another one for the record books. Revenue grew 23.7% to finish at a record $8.4 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow all set new records. We significantly increased the capital return to shareholders in fiscal year 2023 to $1.64 billion, representing a 76.6% growth as compared to fiscal year 2022 through a combination of increasing dividends and our formulaic share buyback program. My heartfelt gratitude to all of our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding results and especially to the worldwide Microchip team whose tireless efforts are what enabled us to navigate effectively through the business cycle. Taking a look at our March quarter net sales from a product line perspective, our mixed signal microcontroller net sales set another all-time record coming in sequentially up 5.8% in the March quarter and up 23.5% on a year-over-year basis. Our 32-bit mixed signal microcontrollers grew at the fastest rate among our mixed signal microcontroller product line and represented over 48% of our fiscal year 2023 mixed signal microcontroller revenue. As you may have noticed, we are clarifying the nomenclature for our microcontrollers going forward to be mixed signal microcontrollers as they have substantial analogs and mixed signal content integrated on chip. And as a result, exhibit business characteristics that are more like analog and mixed signal products. Staying with mixed signal microcontrollers for a moment. Gartner just published their rankings for calendar year 2022. Using our publicly reported mixed signal microcontroller revenue for calendar year 2022, which Gartner unexpectedly underreported for Microchip. We ranked number three and are just 1.4% away from number one. To put this in perspective, just three years ago in calendar year 2019, by our estimate combined with the Gartner data, we were 16.5% away from number one. We are fast closing on the number one spot. Moving next to our analog business. Our analog net sales also set another all-time record, coming in sequentially up 1.9% in the March quarter and up 19.9% on a year-over-year basis. Fiscal year 2023 analog sales were $2.4 billion and broke through the $2 billion mark for the first time ever. We are gaining share in our analog business with our total system solutions approach, continuing to provide a tailwind for this product line. While we don't normally breakout our FPGA product line results, it is note worthy to report that our March quarter and fiscal year 2023 revenue for FPGA for both records. In fact, our fiscal year 2023 FPGA revenue exceeded $550 million, grew more than 31% as compared to fiscal year 2022 and delivered operating margins up a north of corporate average. Our design win momentum is strong and we offer market-leading mid-range FPGA solutions with best-in-class low-power reliability and security. At our Investor Day in November 2021, we emphasized the importance of six market mega trends for our long-term growth and shared that we expected our revenue growth from customers and applications within the megatrends to be approximately 2x of Microchips growth rate. We just completed our revenue by megatrend analysis for fiscal year 2023. As compared to fiscal year 2021, which is the last time we conducted the same analysis, Microchip overall revenue grew 55.2% while revenue from our megatrends grew 108.5% right in line with our expectation of roughly 2x growth from the megatrend. Revenue from the six megatrends represented approximately 45% of our fiscal year 2023 revenue as compared to approximately 34% of our fiscal year 2021 revenue. We also just completed our revenue by end market analysis for fiscal 2023. As compared to fiscal 2022, our industrial business grew from 40% to 41% of our revenue. Our data center and computing business grew from 18% to 19% of our revenue and our consumer appliance business declined from 14% to 12% of our revenue. Automotive and communications infrastructure remained unchanged at 17% and 11% of our revenue respectively. As you can see from the data, slowly but surely, we continue to curate an increasing proportion of our business towards less volatile and more resilient end markets. Now for some color on the March quarter. While our overall business remained strong in the March quarter, many of our customers felt the effect of slowing economic activity and increased business uncertainty, request to push out or cancel backlog increased, and we were able to push out significant amounts of backlog to later quarters to help customers with inventory positions. This resulted in our days of inventory growing. We are comfortable with this inventory growth given the very long life cycles and durable end markets for our products by taking action to reduce customer inventory overbuild and carrying that inventory on our balance sheet, we expect to increase our odds of achieving a soft landing and also expect to be better positioned to respond to demand growth and the macro environment strengthened. Consistent with the slowing macro environment and the growth in our inventory, we have paused most of our internal factory expansion plans, reduced our capital investment plan for fiscal year 2024 and taken steps to lower our inventory in the coming quarters. As a result of the uncertain macro environment and multiple quarters worth of backlog on our books, our bookings have slowed down as expected over the last two quarters. In order to provide customers with more flexibility in an uncertain demand environment as well as to achieve a more healthy and sustainable long-term supply-demand down, we are striving to bring average lead times down to under 26 weeks over the course of the second half of 2023. We believe there are three reasons why Microchip's business continues to demonstrate more resilience in the midst of the weakness seen by some other semiconductor companies. First, on the demand side, the end markets that we have the most exposure to; industrial, which includes aerospace and defense; automotive and data center; and the applications within these end markets where we are strong, are less volatile and comparatively more resilient. Second, on the supply side, a vast majority of our products are built on specialized technologies requiring trailing edge capacity. This is the capacity that has been most constrained over the last two-plus years and where there was less opportunity to overship to consumption. And third, a laser focus on organic growth for multiple years by concentrating on total system solutions and higher growth megatrends, which we just discussed a few minutes ago, has translated into increased design wins, further share gains and a resultant revenue tailwind. A quick update regarding the CHIPS Act. We have been getting the benefit of the investment tax credit since the beginning of this year, and we are in the process of submitting our applications for grants to support expansion in several of our domestic factories. The timeline for when grants maybe approved is not yet determinable. Now let's get to the guidance for the June quarter. Although our backlog for the June quarter is strong, we expect to continue to take active steps to help customers with inventory positions to push out their backlog. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the June quarter to be up between 1% and 4% sequentially. At the midpoint of our net sales guidance, our year-over-year growth in the June quarter would be a strong 16.5%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 68.3% and 68.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 20.1% and 20.5% of sales, and we expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 47.8% and 48.4% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.63 and $1.65. At the midpoint of our non-GAAP EPS guidance, our year-over-year growth for the June quarter would be a strong 19.7% despite a much higher tax rate than the year-ago quarter. Finally, as you can see from our March quarter results and our June quarter guidance, our Microchip 3.0 strategy, which we launched 18 months ago is firing on all cylinders as we continue to build and improve what we believe is one of the most diversified, defensible, high growth, high margin, high cash generating businesses in the semiconductor industry. However, we also recognized that we operate in a cyclical industry and that we are not immune to business cycles. But if you review Microchip's speak to trust performance through the business cycles over the last 15-plus years, you will observe our robust and consistent cash generation, gross margin and operating margin results. Although we don't foresee any significant decline in our business, if we were to experience the semiconductor inventory correction, like the industry has seen in the past, we are highly confident that our non-GAAP operating margins would remain well above 40%. We remain cautiously optimistic about navigating to a soft landing for our business in this cycle and expect our cash generation gross margin and operating margin to once again demonstrate consistency and resiliency through the cycles. With that, let me pass the baton to Steve to talk about our cash return to shareholders. By the way, Steve just published a new book called Up and to the Right, which chronicles building Microchip into a technology juggernaut. Investors and analysts can get additional insights from the book about the foundational elements behind Microchip's long-term business success. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and thanks for the plug on the book, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter while making new records in many respects, namely; record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non-GAAP EPS and record adjusted EBITDA and all of that in a continuing challenging environment. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 38.8% from the year ago quarter to $0.383 per share. During the last quarter, we purchased $273.9 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $195.9 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $469.8 million. This amount was 62.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $751.6 million during the December 2022 quarter. Our paydown of debt as well as record adjusted EBITDA drove down our net leverage at the end of March 2023 quarter to 1.45x from 1.56x at the end of December 2022. This also marks the pivotal point of our net leverage going below 1.5x, at which we further accelerate our cash return to the shareholders, which I will describe further. Ever since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $2.336 billion to shareholders through March 31, 2023 by a combination of dividends and share buybacks. In the current June quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow from the March quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes a net $79.5 million that we collected from our customers and paid to our suppliers for long-term supply assurance payment. These payments are refundable when purchase commitments are fulfilled. The adjusted free cash flow for the March quarter was $517.3 million. We plan to return 67.5% or $349.2 million of that amount to our shareholders with the dividend expected to be approximately $209 million and the stock buyback expected to be approximately $140.2 million. The above numbers reflect a pivot in one area. We are increasing the total return to shareholders in 500 basis point increments per quarter instead of the 250 basis points we were increasing until now. Going forward, we plan to continue to increase free cash flow return to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of our adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders. That will take seven more quarters and dividends over time, we expect will represent approximately 50% of our cash returns. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. I was hoping you could give a little bit more color and context in terms of the demand environment. Ganesh, you talked about experiencing push-outs from your customers an uptick in cancellations. But are these sort of events broad-based across geographies and end markets and device types? Or is it a little bit more concentrated? And then I have a follow-up.
Ganesh Moorthy: Generally speaking, I would say there are a cross section of those requests from many geographies, many customers, many end markets. We also continue to have constrained products on which that are shortages that we're trying to accelerate product for. So it is not only one directional in which the demand requests are coming in at.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. And then as my follow-up, just your thoughts on trough gross margins. You provided a good context in terms of operating margins. I think you said well above 40% in a kind of a recessionary or contractionary environment. How should we think about gross margins off of these record levels as you work down inventory and presumably reduce utilization rates? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: They're going to be darn good. If you look at our history, you can get a pretty good idea of what the gross margin trough-to-peak or peak-to-trough look like. We are sitting at 48% operating margin, giving you 8 percentage points as a bottom end of where is this going to be an operating margin, I think you can draw the conclusion relatively easily.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: And we have some charts on our website to look at the last 15 years of history, and you can draw some conclusions from that.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Ambrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you very much. Yes, that chart was very helpful, Eric. I had my – for my first question. For the last few quarters, you have been guiding for the quarter out. And so I just wanted to make sure that you are not able to guide for September vis-à-vis if you just look at how the business has changed, and I'm just reading your comments, it sounds like that confidence does not be this quarter?
Ganesh Moorthy: So we have not adopted a consistent practice of providing more than one quarter guidance. At certain points of time, we have elected to provide more than one quarter guidance or directional guidance sometimes and this is when we believed it would help investors and analysts better frame our current quarter guidance. Having provided the extra quarter of directional guidance for three quarters in a row, it did not appear to add much value to analysts or investors who are more worried about the overall semiconductor industry cycle. And in fact, it seemed to elicit more skepticism in our ability to provide guidance and confidence in our understanding of the business. And therefore, we've decided to end the temporary practice we started and over to just providing one quarter’s guidance.
Ambrish Srivastava: Makes sense. Accepted. Proved how wrong I was every quarter. I just had a question on the push Ganesh. How do they come back to the overall PSP? I'm assuming that this is not in the NCNR because those you have said in the past, you're not willing to negotiate or less willing to negotiate on. Is that the right way to think about it? The PSP has both NCNRs and non-NCNRs and they push out some more related to the non-NCNRs?
Ganesh Moorthy: So maybe let me clarify. All PSP backlog is non-cancelable, non-reschedulable. What I have said before is that we are not flexible in the non-cancelable portion, we are flexible on the non-reschedulable and that's where we're pushing up. So we are pushing our backlog, PSP or not into further quarters. And that's the way in which we support customers whose business environment has changed and who have concern about their inventory level and in the process, hopefully, create less of an overhang that we will run into and more of a soft landing for our own business. But we are flexible on the reschedulability, just not on the non-cancelablity.
Ambrish Srivastava: Got it. Thank you for the clarification. Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question, Vivek.
Vivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. Ganesh, I wanted to revisit again this question of end market. So there's a perception that aerospace defense, medical parts of data center these markets are holding up better. So can you give us a sense that in the last three months, specifically which end markets or customers in which end market have asked you or you have asked them and they have agreed to pushing off some of their demand because I just want to make sure that RV, when you say a soft landing, are we talking about revenues kind of floating at plus/minus the levels you're giving for June? Or is there some bigger drop off? And like having that end market view, I think we'll be better prepared to analyze, right, where – how we should be thinking about September and December?
Ganesh Moorthy: In an absolute sense. There's no end market that I can say is the only one that has a problem or one that has no problem at all. It's all on a relative basis. And so the strength comes from those end markets where there's far better resilience, far better end market characteristics. Those are the ones we described as industrial, including aerospace and defense, automotive, parts of the data center that we have exposure to. And even if you look at industrial, I know different people have had different comments on it, but our exposure in industrial is dominated by aerospace and defense, renewable energy, energy efficiency, factory automation, medical, infrastructure. These are all the parts of industrial that dominate us. Now within that, is there going to be somebody asking for a pushout or reschedule or a swap of certain products? Sure, there'll be some of that. But in the aggregate, that end market is doing extremely well compared to the rest of the end markets that perhaps are in consumer and phones and others, which we don't have much exposure to.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, I just actually had two quick clarifications, perhaps for Eric. Eric just what is the right way to look at the other expense line? And any implication of kind of the rising rates on your debt servicing? And then OpEx, right, it's kind of – our OpEx intensity is lower than your long-term model. So how are you planning to manage expenses as the business goes through this kind of slowdown in the near term?
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So let me take the other expense piece first, which is obviously dominated by interest expense. So yes, we are being impacted by the rising rate environment. We don't have much variable rate debt left on the balance sheet today. It's just our line of credit, which is about $100 million. But we do have bonds coming due in both June and September of this calendar year that the current intention is to refinance those or retire those using our line of credit and the interest rate currently on the variable line of credit, is higher than where those bonds are at. So we are going to be facing a higher interest expense each quarter as we go through this fiscal year. It's not like a stair step jump, but definitely the interest expense will be rising by several million dollars per quarter. I think the debt schedule that's on our website can help you model that because it shows the maturity dates and the interest rates on those various pieces of debt and our current borrowing rate on our line of credit is about 6.35%. So I think with that information, you can probably model that out appropriately. On the OpEx side, yes, we are below our long-term model. And obviously, Microchip has grown very fast over the last couple of years, and we've had a hard time keeping up with expenses and expenses as a percentage of net sales is dropping again this quarter at the midpoint of guidance, OpEx is rising in dollars again, but the percentage is coming down. And the large factor in there in terms of just our hiring activities is the variable compensation that we're paying to our employees. And as the environment changes from one of very high growth to one of more moderate growth, we will moderate those bonuses that are being paid to help us manage appropriately within our long-term model. I don't know if Ganesh wants to add anything more.
Ganesh Moorthy: No. I think you stated it exactly so. And as we've always said, right, the operating expenses are an investment in the long-term growth profitability resilience of our results. And so those investments need to be made and to have years and years of return on those investments. And we are below our target, but as things settle out over time, that will creep up, but not at an accelerated rate.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Joshua Buchalter from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question, Joshua.
Joshua Buchalter: Hi, team. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to, I guess, ask about the pricing environment. So when you were discussing the PSP, you mentioned that backlog is non-cancelable. But it sounds like it's flexible on the time line. Can you talk about how the pricing discussions go, both within your PSP program and then outside it? And if there's been any change in that as you're going to – you're starting to lower inventories a bit? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: So pricing is not any difference between PSP and non-PSP. So I'll give you a more general answer for just our overall methodology. Pricing for us is a strategic exercise. We provide products that are sole-sourced products, they are proprietary products and customers place their trust in us years before they go to production and then they're with us for many, many years to come. Traditionally, over the years, we have not had annual price reductions necessarily as a consistent part of what we do. In the last two years, we've had inflation at a much higher rate than what we would absorb with our improvements, and we did pass along price increases that would absorb the cost increases, keeping it margin neutral, and that has not changed and that we don't expect to change as we go forward. So pricing is stable and strategic and I think, in our thought process.
Joshua Buchalter: Got it. Thank you. And I was hoping you could maybe help us understand the utilization rates a little bit better. Can you walk us through where things are at in your front end and whether, I guess, as you lower inventory, more of it is coming out of your internal facilities versus your foundry partners? Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. So utilization in the factories has been very high throughout the last year. That continues today. So we aren't facing underutilization charges or anything like that. We're still trying to get caught up on our backlog. So the factories are still running at a pretty high rate.
Ganesh Moorthy: And we don't expect the reduction of inventory days to affect what we're going to do in our factories in terms of underloading them. So the internal factories are running lower inventory and they will run constant through this cycle. And so there's no under absorption issue to be concerned about.
Joshua Buchalter: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Raji Gill from Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Rajvindra Gill: Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. And congratulations on kind of solid results in a tough environment. Just in terms of the backlog. So in the past, you mentioned as the backlog come down through the year as lead times start to normalize, you'll start to see that – you'll see more order volatility. And I think you're indicating that, but in the past, you mentioned that the delta between the backlog and the actual sales is still quite wide. That backlog to sales delta could offset that potential order volatility. So I wanted to get a sense of what are your thoughts on the backlog to sales delta as we stand today?
Ganesh Moorthy: So we still have significant backlog in excess of our sales. And we have backlog over multiple quarters, and we continue to get new bookings and backlog that layers in over time. The backlog is a function of also where customers view lead times are going to be headed, not so much what they're going to be consuming. And so as lead times slowly pull in, we do expect that customers will slow down some of what they want to do in terms of placing backlog. Now any kind of inventory adjustment is not a permanent change in this industry, right. A year ago, we were – we had a completely different view of where things were. And a year from now, we may have a completely different view of where things are likely to be. I think many customers are strategic in their thinking, have very high-value end products and what they're doing. And so they are more strategic in how they're thinking about their inventory over time and what backlog they will place. But we don't see any concern with the amount of backlog we need to be able to achieve the guidance that we have provided and the soft landing that we're trying to drive towards. Obviously, it still will require bookings to come in and that is all driven by how consumption continues.
Rajvindra Gill: Thank you, Ganesh for that. And just my follow-up, what is your latest pulse on China regarding customer order patterns and channel inventory? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: So I would say China is stable. I don't see a major uptick from China post Chinese New Year and we will see how the rest of the year goes. I think there is opportunity for China to strengthen and contribute some tailwinds as we go through the rest of the year. But I can't say that we can see that today in what we see with the auto patterns.
Rajvindra Gill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Chris Danely from Citi. Please proceed with your question, Chris.
Christopher Danely: Hey, thanks guys. Can you give us a sense of how much of the backlog right now, let's just say, for the next 12 months is PSP versus, I guess, the "can be canceled or can be pushed out"? Any kind of percentage there?
Ganesh Moorthy: So the percent of backlog that is PSP has amazingly been consistent for the last, I would say, nine to 12 months. So even as overall backlog has been slowly ticking down, right? PSP as a percent of total backlog, it's well over 50%, have stayed at that level. So it is resilient backlog. It is higher quality backlog than what we see.
Christopher Danely: Great. And have you had any customers try and renegotiate any of the PSP agreements either supply or price?
Ganesh Moorthy: Not on price. I think there have been customers asking for help on PSP backlog that they wanted to have pushed out in time. And as I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, that is something that we have been actively doing to enable them to have that. It's a strange environment where I think in the shorter term, there are more people looking to push out because they're uncertain about their business. But we're also seeing cases where people who wanted to push out several months ago coming back in and wanting to pull it back in as well. So I think sometimes there is an overcorrection on both sides, and I would not be surprised as we go through the second half of this year that some of all the push outs that are happening today if the environment strengthens, it could just as well come right back out at that point in time. But in today's environment, it's very murky.
Christopher Danely: Yes. Thanks a lot, Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question, Joe.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. Thanks for all the color on the actions you guys are taking to match up customer inventories. Can you talk about what you think the state of those inventories are? And I know some of your competitors have talked about we're trying to prune some of the backlog, we're proactively making sure that our shipments are going into demand and not into inventory. Can you just talk about where you think you are relative to others? How careful are you trying to be in terms of preserving the customer inventory balances being where you think got to be?
Ganesh Moorthy: So our visibility into customer inventory is not there because they don't share that with us. We can infer their inventory by their request for pushouts or cancellations as the case might be. Where there is cancelable backlog or cancelable – basically anytime there's – or reschedule backlog, they can do that. Where it is non-reschedulable and noncancelable and they ask for help, then we get involved in it. But it's hard for us to know where customer is and their inventory correction position. We can see that in distribution. And there, we get a weekly report, it tells us by distributor in different parts of the world where is that? As Eric mentioned, distribution days of inventory went up by two days from 22 to 24 days. Still well in control, below where it used to be historically and where is at. And so that's about as much color as we can give you on kind of customer inventory or end customer inventory.
Joseph Moore: Okay. That makes sense. And I guess as you've described the PSP over the last couple of quarters, you're now kind of taking a little bit more of an approach of helping the customers were they want to reduce it. Is that because there's just more people asking now as you're trying to match it up? Or were they asking two quarters ago, but it wasn't broad enough. I'm just – there's a perception, I guess, that because of PSP, you may have more inventory at customers than peers. And I'm just trying to see if your behavior is really that much different than anyone else.
Ganesh Moorthy: So let me clarify. I don't know where that perception was set, maybe what we said in the past. We have been pushing out orders from customers, PSP customers for multiple quarters, right? I mean we're in this to be responsive to the market, but we also want to make sure that as noncancelable orders get placed, there is a symmetric responsibility from us and from our customers, and that's what creates some resistance to placing orders that they shouldn't be placing or that are speculative and where they're at. So we've done this multiple quarters. This is not the first quarter we're doing it. And it is in response to where markets and customers and specific situations are at. And we will continue to do it as needed, including in this quarter.
Joseph Moore: Very helpful. Thank you for the clarification.
Steve Sanghi: I just want to add one point. This is Steve. I think investors and analysts failed to appreciate that when a customer is placing a year worth of orders, which by contract non-cancelable and non-reschedulable. It goes through a level of review at the customer at much higher level than just only the purchasing person, and the resulting backlog that is placed on Microchip is a much higher quality. So therefore, even though we have taken some adjustments in rescheduling some of the PSP backlog, the fundamental fact is that the backlog is a very high quality relative to a similar backlog at any other competitor.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question, Harlan.
Harlan Sur: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Was the unsupported backlog to actual revenue shift still above one in the March quarter? And where do you anticipate that ratio to be this quarter?
Ganesh Moorthy: I believe the unsupported backlog was greater than the amount that we shipped in the quarter, but I think it's becoming a less relevant indicator at this point, right? We are unsupported means it's on our backlog, it is noncancelable. But we are helping – and nonreschedulable, but we are actively allowing customers to reschedule it out in time. And so we don't pay that much attention to it today as we did a year ago. Today, it's really making sure that we are shipping to customers who need the product. We're helping customers who are asking for help and working towards setting this thing up to not have an overhang to the best extent that we can.
Harlan Sur: Okay. Perfect. Thanks for that. And then your data center products are quite application specifically, right? So a bit easier to track rate storage controllers, enterprise – key controllers, Ethernet PHYs and so on, right? The demand dynamics in cloud and more so in Enterprise data center have clearly weakened. I know you guys have said some products are strong, some products are still weak, but is the aggregate data center franchise holding up on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis?
Ganesh Moorthy: Absolutely. And I would say we are getting tailwinds from the AI servers and we are represented in those. Many of our PCI switches are an analytical part of that. The storage in general, is stable, but it has experienced substantial growth over the last year. And the data center is holding up. Obviously, not as strong today as it was from a year-ago growth but still stable.
Harlan Sur: Thank you, Ganesh.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. I had a follow-up on the rescheduling of backlog. I mean the semi industry has obviously been struggling for a while now. So would you say that this more recent phenomenon is due to some of the financial stresses that's going on? And the reason I'm asking that is because I'm just wondering if people are pushing out because they feel a little bit uncomfortable with the current financial environment and as soon as there's some stabilization, perhaps those pushouts will turn into pull-in. So I'm just hoping you could give us your view there?
Ganesh Moorthy: I'm sure there's a portion of that, that falls into that. But you've also got to think about the environment is more stressful for our customers today with where inflation is at, where interest rate is at, what the economy in general is doing in terms of relative growth rate from a year-ago. And so they placed orders with the best intention with the best information that they had back in time. And as the environment has changed, are, in some cases, seeing their demand picture different and therefore, asking for our supply picture to adapt to where they're at. I don't believe this is a permanent change. I think these things go in cycles. And I do think as the economy at some point reverses and gathers more strength as the macro gathers more strength. Many of these will come right back up. And I do expect if history is to be repeated, we will, at some point, go back into people asking for expedites on things that maybe three months ago, six months ago, they were asking for pushouts. It's the nature of the beast and people have the best visibility at any point in time. But as that visibility pushes out their need or pulls in their need, they will signal to us what we have to do to help them.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. And as my follow-up is one for Steve and Steve, congratulations on your new book. What was the reason behind the increase of the returns from 250 to 500 bps a quarter. I guess my question is more on the timing of it. I mean you just feel more confident about the profitability of the company during the soft landing period? If you could just elaborate on the timing, that would be great?
Steve Sanghi: So the reason in going from 250 bps increase per quarter to 500 was clearly hitting a target of a total leverage going below 1.5x. So this is what we have said for a long time that by paying down the debt every quarter, we're going to bring the leverage below 1.5x. And when that happens, then we will further accelerate the return to the shareholders. So that happened last quarter where the leverage was 1.45. So therefore, we are accelerating the total cash return to shareholders from 62.5% last quarter to 67.5% this quarter, a difference of 500 bps. And the following quarter will be 72.5% than 77.5% and so on will take about seven quarters to get to 100.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Thank you again.
Eric Bjornholt: And over that seven quarters, we will continue to use the excess cash to pay down debt and bring leverage down further. We think it is appropriate in a difficult interest rate environment.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Thank you, Eric.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question, Vijay. Vijay, you may proceed with your question. If your line is muted, please unmute, so that you can compose your question.
Vijay Rakesh: I’m sorry. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us some color on what ASP trends look like exiting 2022 and how they are looking this year? And then I have a follow-up.
Ganesh Moorthy: To the earlier question, ASP trends tend to be reasonably stable. We have passed along price increases to a lesser extent than what we have, I don't know, always absorbed from a cost standpoint, trying to be margin neutral to make sure that between the improvements we're making in our own business, and the pricing from a market standpoint being reasonable to the customer. So ASPs today, if you were to compare them with a year-ago are slightly higher, but there are stable trends on the [indiscernible].
Eric Bjornholt: And some of those trends is not necessarily price increase driven. It's introducing new proprietary more complex products that bring more value to our customers.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And then just addressing the comment you had in your deck. Just wondering what percentage of customers you're seeing kind of redeploy – look to redeploy backlog or push out cancel. What are you seeing there? If you could give us some idea on if it's like any particular segment that you're seeing it. That's it. Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: It's next to impossible to give you a number because we serve about 125,000 customers, about 115 of them are indirect through our distributor channels. So we don't really hear customer by customer where it's at. I would say that it's not the majority of the business that we're doing, it's specific customers and specific markets in any given day, that's there. So there's not a wholesale. I want to push everything out that's out there.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We'll move on to our next question, which is coming from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Danely: Thanks guys. I just have two quickies and then I guess I'll let everybody go back to working on the notes. Is there any way you could tell like how much of this changes in backlog is too much inventory versus weaker demand? Is it 50-50 a little more on the demand side, a little more on the inventory side. Any color, any clarity there?
Ganesh Moorthy: Those two are interconnected, right? It's not that – it's only one or the other. So weaker demand results in more inventory, which last some longer or stronger demand results in needing to expedite as well. So it's hard to parse those out. There's some of both that's in there. And in many of these – our customers who are also facing uncertainty perhaps – so it may not just be demand alone, but the environment that they're in, and they are trying to decide how should they navigate their environment. And so what we see in the end is the aggregate feedback or request that they provide us. And with all of that, we're able to show continuing growth into this quarter, into the June quarter. As it stands right now, we believe it is highly unlikely at the September quarter is going to have a sequential down quarter and that's a basis of all of our integrated information from customers on what they're seeing on internal data that we see in all of our indicators, bookings, backlog, expediter class, pushout requests, all the external data that we track, GDP, PMI, consumer confidence, inflation, et cetera. And so that's what gives us the confidence in our business.
Christopher Danely: Perfect. Thanks, Ganesh. Thanks for letting me ask another question.
Ganesh Moorthy: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Ganesh Moorthy for closing remarks. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: I want to thank everybody for your time and questions this afternoon. We will be seeing many of you on the road as we come out to different conferences, et cetera. And thank you again.
Operator: Thank you very much. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you very much for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-02-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to Microchip's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Eric Bjornholt, our CFO. Please go ahead, sir.
James Eric Bjornholt: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company, I wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head Of Investor Relations. I will comment on our third quarter financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. And Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond specific industrial and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted the full GAAP to non GAAP reconciliation on the investor relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of our operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments that described in our press release and in the reconciliations on our website. Net sales in the December quarter were $2.169 billion, which was up 4.6% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 68.1%, operating expenses were 20.6% and operating income was a record 47.5%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $863.7 million, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.56 and at the high-end of our guidance range. On a GAAP basis in the December quarter, gross margins were a record at 67.8%, total operating expenses were $659.2 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $167.4 million, special charges of $6.5 million and $0.3 million of acquisition related and other costs and share-based compensation of $37.1 million. GAAP net income was a record $580.3 million, resulting at a $1.4 in earnings per diluted share. As compared to a year ago quarter, our December quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably the tax expense recorded as a result of the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 11.9% in the December quarter. We now expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '23 to be about 11% exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. A reminder of what we communicated over the past couple quarters. Our fiscal '23 cash tax rate is higher than our fiscal '22 tax rate for a variety of factors including lower availability of tax attributes such as net operating losses and tax credits, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. We're still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 300 basis points favorable adjustment to Microchips non-GAAP tax rate in future periods. Our inventory balance at December 31, 2022 was $1.165 billion. We had 152 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, which was up 13 days from the prior quarters level. We've increased our raw materials inventory to help protect our internal manufacturing supply lines. We are carrying higher work in progress to help maximize the utilization of constraint equipment, as well as to position ourselves to take advantage of new equipment installations, which should really bottlenecks. We are investing in building inventory for long lived high margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners. We need to take actions to help ensure that our supply lines can feed growth beyond what we expect in the March 2023 and June 2023 quarters and our reported days of inventory is a backward looking indicator. As gross margins rise, the effective days of inventory for the same physical inventory rises. And with every 100 basis points of gross margin growth it creates approximately three incremental days of inventory. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter was at 22 days, which was up 3 days from the prior quarters level. Our cash flow from operating activities was a record $1.278 billion in the December quarter. Included in our cash flow from operating activities was $385 million of long-term supply assurance receipts. We are going to adjust these items out of our free cash flow to determine the adjusted free cash flow that we will return to shareholders as these payments will be refundable over time as purchase commitments are fulfilled. Our adjusted free cash flow was $751.6 million and 34.6% of net sales in the December quarter. As of December 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $288.9 million. We paid down $719.1 million of total debt in the December quarter, and our net debt was reduced by $701.2 million. Over the last 18 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $6.2 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt. Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was a record at $1.106 billion and 51% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $4.051 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.56 at December 31, 2022, down from 1.84 at September 30, 2022 and down from 2.58 at December 31, 2021. Capital expenditures were $141.3 million in the December quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 is between $525 million and $545 million, as we continue to take actions to support the growth of our business and ramp our manufacturing operations accordingly. We continue to prudently add capital equipment to maintain grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected long-term growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvements to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $55.3 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business and the December quarter as well as our guidance for the March quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our December quarter results were well above the midpoint of our revenue guidance marked by our disciplined execution as well as our resilient end markets. Net sales grew 4.6% sequentially and 23.4% on a year-over-year basis to achieve another all time record are $2.17 billion. The December quarter also marked our ninth consecutive quarter of growth. Non-GAAP gross margins came in above the high-end of our guidance at a record 68.1%, up 38 basis points from the September quarter and up 202 basis points from the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin also came in above the high-end of our guidance at a record 47.5%, up 62 basis points from the September quarter and up 283 basis points from the year ago quarter. Due to a rapid increase in net sales over the last 2 years, operating expenses at 20.65% were 185 basis points below the low end of our long-term model range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Our long-term operating expense model will continue to guide our investment actions to drive the long-term growth, profitability and durability of our business. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was at the high-end of our guidance at a record $1.56 per share, up 30% from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA at 51% of net sales and adjusted free cash flow at 34.6% of net sales for both very strong in the December quarter, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation capabilities of our business. As Eric mentioned, we have excluded $385 million of long-term supply assurance payments made by customers from our adjusted free cash flow calculation. Since these payments are refundable when customers fulfill their purchase commitments. Net debt declined by $701.2 million, driving our net leverage ratio down to 1.56x, exiting the December quarter. During the December quarter, we returned $409.8 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, representing 60% of the prior quarters free cash flow. We expect to get below 1.5x net leverage by the end of the March quarter. And as Steve will share with you later, the Microchip Board has decided to increase the rate at which capital will be returned to shareholders starting in the June quarter. My heartfelt gratitude to all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding results and especially to the worldwide Microchip team whose tireless efforts and strong sense of ownership are what enabled us to navigate effectively in the midst of turbulent times. Taking a look at our net sales from a product line perspective, our microcontroller net sales were sequentially up 3.5% in the December quarter, and set another all time record. On a year-over-year basis, our December quarter microcontroller net sales were up 25.6%. Microcontrollers represented 56.3% of our net sales in the December quarter. Our analog net sales were sequentially up 5.9% in the December quarter, and also set an all time record. On a year-over-year basis, our December quarter analog net sales were up 21.2%. Analog represented 28% of our net sales on the December quarter. In the December quarter, our FPGA net sales also achieved a new record. While our overall business remains strong in the December quarter, the consumer appliance and market was weak as was our overall business in China. Our China business was initially impacted by COVID lockdowns and then subsequently impacted by the rapid transmission of COVID when lockdowns were lifted. Both actions adversely impacted our customers operations during the December quarter, resulting in inventory of many customers and distributors being higher than normal. In response to the weaker business environment in China, and a small but increasing number of other customers who have inventory and requested push outs, we took action in the December quarter to delay or redirect some shipments and plan to do more of the same in the March quarter. This is designed to reduce customer and channel inventory overbuilt, but will also increase the inventory on our balance sheet in the near-term. In the medium term, we expect this will give us a better chance to achieve a soft landing and position us well to respond to a stronger demand growth as the macro environment improves. As a result of the uncertain macro environment, and the multiple quarters with a backlog on our books, most of which is non cancelable, our bookings have slowed down as we expected. Given the circumstances we view the bookings slowdown as a positive which will serve to preserve the quality of new backlog that gets placed. Our unsupported backlog which represents backlog customers wanted shipped to them in the December quarter, but which we could not deliver in the December quarter remain well in excess of the actual net sales we achieved. Unsupported backlog did declined slightly for the first time in nine quarters. And we are continuing to work hard to further reduce our unsupported backlog, as well as our lead times to more manageable levels. While we have seen an increase in requests to push out or cancel backlog, these requests remain a small fraction of the very large backlog we have over multiple quarters, and hence they have not had a material effect on our business. Despite supply gradually improving, we expect to have supply constraints from much of 2023. However, in order to achieve a more healthy and sustainable business environment, we are driving to bring average lead times down to 26 weeks or less by the time we get to the second half of 2023. And we will be publishing a customer letter to this effect shortly. We believe there are three reasons why Microchip's business is demonstrating more resilience in the midst of the weakness seen by some other semiconductor companies. First, on the demand side, the industrial, automotive, aerospace and defense, data center and communications infrastructure end markets, which make up approximately 86% of our net sales remain solid. The consumer end market, which is about 14% of our net sales is experiencing some weakness, but it's dominated by home appliances which are comparatively more resilient. There are some signs that the data center end market could see some headwinds in 2023. Although our business remains strong, based on the market share gains we have had. And our overall demand remains quite durable, because of the end market mix we have consciously gravitated towards over the years. Second, on the supply side, a vast majority of our products are built on specialized technologies requiring trailing edge capacity. This is the capacity that has been most constrained over the last 2 years, which still remains constrained and where there was less opportunity to over ship [ph] to consumption. And last but not least, our laser focus on organic growth through total system solutions and higher growth mega trends for multiple years is giving us increased design momentum, farther share gains and a result in revenue tailwind. If you review Microchip's peak to trough performance through the business cycles over the last 15 plus years, you will observe a robust and consistent cash generation, gross margin and operating margin results. The investor presentation posted on our IR website has details of our performance through the business cycle. We remain cautiously optimistic about navigating to a soft landing for our business and expect our cash generation gross margin and operating margin to once again demonstrate consistency and resiliency through the cycle. Last quarter, we mentioned that Microchip was in the early stages of considering building a 300 millimeter U.S based fab for specialized trailing edge technologies. After a detailed analysis, we have concluded not to move forward with this project. And that our business objectives would likely be better achieved through our relationships with our foundry suppliers with lower execution risk, and a better return on invested capital. The CHIPS Act is already making a positive impact on our business through the investment tax credit, which started on January 1. And with impending capacity expansion grants that we will be seeking with several of our U.S semiconductor factories. We believe that CHIPS Act is good for the semiconductor industry and for America, as it enables critical investments, which will help even the global playing field while being strategically important for American economic and national security. Now, let's get into the guidance for the March quarter. Our backlog for the March quarter is strong, and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. However, we are also taking active steps to help customers with inventory positions to selectively push out some of their backlog. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be up between 1% and 4% sequentially. Further, we expect sequential net sales growth again in the June quarter. At the midpoint of our net sales guidance, our year-over-year growth for the March quarter would be a strong 20.6%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 68.1% and 68.3% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 20.6% and 20.8% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 47.3% and 47.7% of sales. And we expect a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.61 per share and $1.63 per share. At the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance, our year-over-year growth for the March quarter would be a strong 20% despite a much higher tax rate than the year ago quarter. Finally, as you can see from our December quarter results and our March quarter guidance, our Microchip 3.0 strategy, which we launched 15 months ago, is firing on all cylinders as we continue to build and improve what we believe is one of the most diversified, defensible, high growth, high margin, high cash generating businesses in the semiconductor industry. Our Board of Directors and leadership team operate just as long-term owners of the business would thoughtfully making the key investments in people, technology, capacity, culture and sustainability required to thrive in the long-term. While being prudent, pragmatic and nimble about whatever short-term adjustments may be required. We are confident we will effectively navigate through whatever macro business challenges may unfold in 2023. Let me now pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?
Stephen Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter, while making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non GAAP EPS and record adjusted EBITDA and all that in a continuing challenging supply environment. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 9.1% from last quarter to 35.8 cents per share. This is an increase of 41.5% from the year ago quarter. During the last quarter, we purchased $229.5 million of stock in the open market. We also paid out $180.3 million in dividends. Thus the total cash return was $409.8 million. This amount was 60% of our actual free cash flow of $682.9 million during the September 2022 quarter. Our pay down of debt as well as record adjusted EBITDA drove down our net leverage at the end of December 2022 quarter to 1.56 from 1.84 at the end of September. Ever since we achieved an investment grade rating for a debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $1.867 billion to shareholders through December 31, 2022 by a combination of dividends and share buybacks. In the current March quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow from the December quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes $385 million that we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when customer fulfill their purchase commitments. The adjusted free cash flow for December quarter was $751.6 million. We plan to return 62.5% or $469.8 million of that amount to our shareholders. The dividend expected to be approximately $196 million, and the stock buyback expected to be approximately $273.8 million. We also want to provide guidance for a planned cash return to shareholders beyond this quarter. We expect our net debt leverage at the end of March quarter to be less than 1.5. Therefore, our Board of Directors decided that beginning with the June quarter, we will accelerate the cash return to shareholders. We laid out a strategy for our cash return to shareholders at an analyst and investor day in November 2021. We began with returning 50% of the free cash flow of the prior quarter and increasing it by 2.5 percentage points every quarter. With these increases, we'll be returning 62.5% of last quarter's adjusted free cash flow to investors this quarter. Beginning in June quarter, we expect to double the rate at which we are increasing the percentage free cash flow return to shareholders. In other words, in June quarter, we expect to return 67.5% of our adjusted free cash flow from March quarter. Then in September quarter, we expect to return 72.5% of adjusted free cash flow from the June quarter. And so on, 5 percentage point increase every quarter. At this rate, we would approach 100% return of our adjusted free cash flow in about eight quarters. We realized that we're still getting a debt burden of $6.62 billion in a rising interest rate environment as some of our debt matures, we will likely be renewing it at a higher interest rate than we are currently paying on such debt. Our strategy of accelerating our cash return to shareholders over several quarters would help us pay down some additional debt and lower our debt service costs. With that, operator, will you please call for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had a question on the pricing environment. In calendar '22, you grew your business about 25%. What percentage of that was pricing versus volume, and as you look ahead to calendar '23. considering the demand backdrop, considering potential price hikes from some of your foundry partners, how do you think about pricing and how do you see pricing play out and any implications for your margin profile in calendar '23. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: So the price increases in 2022, we're -- at various stages, and different based on customer what contractual agreements we had with them. Our philosophy is the price increases are there to cover the cost increases that we saw in 2022. So we don't have a nice, easy breakout of what was cost driven -- price driven increase versus product shipment increases. And that is a component of both obviously. The intensity of cost increases we're seeing in 2023 are less than what they were in 2022. And we have not really made any judgment yet on price increases for this calendar year. Our intent would be that at some point, we'll look at it, and again have the same philosophy that we want to make sure that the cost increases are covered in any price increases we make. Pricing for us is a strategic exercise. It is intended to make sure that customers get comfort in being able to design, proprietary designs that they're going to run with us for a long time. It is not a tactical exercise to be able to maximize either the price or the revenue or the profits that come from it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Ganesh, I'm curious, do you think the share gains that you're seeing when I compare your sequential or year-on-year growth in calendar Q1 versus your peers. Is that a cyclical thing? Is that a structural thing, because many of your peers also have lower consumer exposure. They have high industrial, automotive exposure, and many of them have guided sales down, yet you're guiding it up in March and suggesting that they could grow again in June. So I'm curious how much of this is just a cyclical issue where you just had a difference and when supply was available? Or is it really you're gaining share or there is something more structural and you can maintain this kind of market share gain advantage over time? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes, as I mentioned, in the three categories of what we believe is differentiating our results, a part of it, which is structural is what we have done for multiple years on how do we grow organically? How does the total system solutions approach which is a huge amount of work across the company come in and then it takes time for it to pay off. That's been happening for multiple years. How do we focus on higher growth opportunities from a market megatrends standpoint. Those are all we believe, unique growth drivers for Microchip, and are in fact structural growth that is being built into what our long-term growth will be.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thanks, Vivek.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Gary Mobley: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I realized that you got out of the business of providing some estimation as to how many quarters in a row you may be able to grow sequentially into the future. But since you did comment on the June quarter, I was hoping that maybe you can share with us the magnitude of the sequential increase you might see in June and then perhaps may this sequential growth continue beyond the June quarter?
Ganesh Moorthy: Firstly, we're not trying to guide anything beyond the June quarter. And for June, like we did in prior quarters, we're giving you a directional expectation that we have, but not an absolute expectation that we have. And we'll get to that when we get to the May conference call. But for now, we feel confident we can grow in the June quarter on top of the guidance we're providing in the March quarter.
Gary Mobley: Thank you. Thank you, Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thanks, Gary.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
Joshua Buchalter: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. This is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt Ramsay. I wanted to ask you about the capital return program. I think some may have expected more binary event when you hit the leverage target, but you're taking the more gradual approach. You called out the rate environment. Can you walk us through sort of why the decision to more gradually take it up? And then also is there I guess an intermediate target leverage where you would stop doing debt repayments altogether and just do 100% repurchases and dividends. Thank you.
James Eric Bjornholt: So what Board has decided is that given $6.62 billion still owing on the debt, and some of that debt, I think at least $2 billion of that debt have an interest rate of below 100 bps. And when that comes up from maturity, we will be renewing it. If we were renewing it today, it will be over 5%. So in that kind of current environment and interest rates are still rising, the Board decided to not go to 100% cash return right away today. They decided to do that over eight quarters. We double the rate at which we are increasing the cash return, we were increasing it like 60%, going to 62.5%, going to 65%. And what we have said is now we will go up 500 bps of the quarter. So current quarter 62.5%, next quarter, 67.5%, then 72.5% and 77.5%. At that rate, I think in seven quarters or so will be 97.5% and then go to 100%. I think that's a more reasonable approach to pay down some more debt along in the next eight quarters.
Ganesh Moorthy: Joshua, if I will add to it, I think, circumstances have changed from 2021 when interest rates were very low, money was freely available to where we are, and we have to adjust as the circumstances change. And that's what the Board in its deliberation had to think about, and decided in terms of how we're going to go forward. We're absolutely committed to what we said. But we're going into glide slope, that is different today given what we know is the circumstances today.
Joshua Buchalter: Thanks for the color and congrats on the results.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Company. Please proceed.
Raji Gill: Yes, thank you, and congrats as well. Wanted to get a view on the trailing edge capacity. How do you see investments in trailing edge capacity going forward with future projects on 300 millimeter. There's chatter that other major companies are increasing CapEx significantly. So just wanted to get a sense of the view of the industry on lagging edge capacity that's obviously been the issue with supply constraints, and how do you think the industry is adjusting to that dynamic?
Ganesh Moorthy: From our perspective, we did that analysis. And in the process of doing the analysis, we had to validate which assumptions we were making, that were reasonable assumptions, which assumptions perhaps are changing over the next 3 to 5 years of time. And we don't know about industry investments necessarily, but we do know that our partners and us in the communication that we have had, have a high confidence prep to being able to satisfy the 300 millimeter trailing edge capacity requirements that our business requires. And with our partners and us, we have concluded that our business is best met with the best overall results in partnership with them.
Raji Gill: Thank you, Ganesh. And for my follow-up, with respect to lead times, as the lead times come in, you did mention that you're starting to see some order push outs, your goal is to kind of get to 26 weeks by the second half of the calendar year. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit further on customers and their backlog. As you -- as they start to reduce long lead time orders as more supply comes online, do you anticipate more order volatility, or how do you manage that? Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: Long lead times are never a good thing for either the customer or for us. There's more uncertainty the farther out in time you go. So providing shorter lead times and working towards getting it is in the best interest of our customer and what they need to plan for and for us and what we need to plan for. And we expect that the bookings and backlog will reflect that change in lead time out in time. Now we're not there today. We're expecting to get there in the second half of the year. And it will still take time, through much of this year that we have to get through the constraints. It also has an unknown, which is what happens in the back half of this year on the demand side of the equation. And if you remember over the last 2 years, the lead times have been driven not because we didn't increase supply, it's because demand increased faster than we could bring out supply every single quarter for about eight quarters. And so we're working hard to be able to get that supply line improvement to bring lead times into a more manageable situation to bring backlog into a more manageable timeframe. And then the demand side of the equation may or may not effect it farther as we go into the second half of the year.
Raji Gill: Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: You’re welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. I had a question on both internal and channel inventory. So it sounds like near-term you want to build even more internally to kind of manage it externally or manage the channel. I was just hoping you could give us some numbers on where you intend the targets to go. I mean, I know what your targets are for channel inventory. But perhaps for the next couple of quarters, how do you view the internal inventory days going versus those in the channel.
Ganesh Moorthy: So we would expect that our internal inventory is likely to go up from where it is. It will get to a point where it will reverse course, I don't have a precise time for when it will. The channel inventory is really in the hands of the channel for them to decide at what level of inventory do they want to run consistent with their working capital, their customer support requirements and all of that. I don’t know, Eric, if you want to add more on that.
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes, so we specifically guided in our release today for inventory days ending March to be between 157 and 164 days. Beyond that, we really haven't given any color. But we'll continue to manage our manufacturing operations and our purchases from our suppliers to be in the right spot to support our customers.
Ganesh Moorthy: Now the way to think about the inventory is this is inventory of product that are very long lifetimes. There is no obsolescence risk on them. It is positioned well to respond to customers and their requirements. If there is a stronger up cycle in the second half of the year, it gets us in a running start to be able to go do that. So we don't see the inventory levels that we are seeing today and predicting for this quarter has anywhere close to being an issue for us.
Tore Svanberg: Great, color. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes again from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you for the follow-up. Maybe one for Steve, just on kind of the philosophy or the approach toward the PSP, I personally was under the impression that you were pretty adamant about customers taking product at least business that, that was tied to PSP. It sounds like you're being a lot more flexible with that, I guess what's changed over the past couple of months. I completely agree with you. It's a win-win, if you -- I guess go for a soft landing, but curious what's changed internally and around the philosophy there. Thank you.
Stephen Sanghi: Toshi, let me have Ganesh answer that.
Ganesh Moorthy: So the philosophy of PSP backlog being high quality backlog, something we would like to get and have on our books, hasn't really changed. The non-cancelability of PSP backlog hasn't really changed. What we have always said is that the non-cancelable part of it is not where we are willing to negotiate. It's on the non-reschedulability or the ability to push it out that we are. And we are working to make sure that where we see customers who have inventory and other customers who don't have product, being able to take and redeploy from one to the other, and that's a common sense way of set -- of helping two customers with one action that we would go do. On the other hand, where we see potential customers who need some help in terms of pushing inventory out quarter boundaries as the case might be, we'll work with them. These are long-term customer relationships that we want to have. What we've always wanted was responsibility from a customer placing PSP backlog on us to be able to honor the non-cancelability, because we make commitments based on that responsibility to our supply chain. And I think you got to have some reliability in the people in that chain who make and meet commitments on the non-cancelability.
Toshiya Hari: Makes sense. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Please proceed.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. You noted that OpEx is tracking below your long-term target right now. And I'm hoping you can help us understand where or maybe give us some expectations as to where that should trend through the year and then longer term, should we expect this percentage to increase?
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes, so we would expect that over time that percentage will increase to -- be within our long-term model range, which we shared with the street last November, November 2021 at our Analyst Day. And so we're well below that today. We've had a couple of fantastic growth years, and it's been difficult to keep up with the span, and particularly hiring people. And we're seeing some of that free up today. So, we are still continuing to hire and add people to our teams to make sure we are supporting the long-term growth of the business with having the people and processes and systems in place to drive that. So you should expect over time that it will gradually inch its way up, but it's not something that happens overnight. You've been seeing that we've been investing significantly in increased operating expense dollars over many quarters now and just that haven't been able to keep up with the rate of revenue growth. And actually in the current quarter, the midpoint of our guidance is actually just slightly higher in percentage terms than what we achieved last quarter. I think it's 20.7% this quarter versus 20.65%. Again, it's the net, but we are continuing to invest and making progress on the hiring front.
Ganesh Moorthy: Will lead the way I think about it philosophically also is that the OpEx investments we make are also critical investments that drive future gross margin improvements, future innovation for delivering to our customers. And the whole growth and profitability of the company is dependent on making good operating investment -- operating expense investments. And so that's why it's important to keep the investments consistent with where growth is, but for long-term growth and profitability.
William Stein: Great. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thanks, Will.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Ambrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you very much. I'll speak for myself, Ganesh. And Steve, you guys have proven me wrong. I thought, okay, it'd be. We have never seen this kind of "soft landing". So two quarters in a row, you have shown and you're given guidance beyond the quarter. So kudos to you for that. But I just wanted to drill in a little bit into a point you made Ganesh. You said that the lead times coming down to 26 weeks, and you made some comments on the PSP as well. It sort of make sure I understood, what are your assumptions for the second half demand that is kind of baked into your comments as you can get lead times after 26 weeks in the back half.
Ganesh Moorthy: We're not getting into specific guidance on second half growth and where it's going to be. I think we're judging based on what are we doing to be able to continue to improve the supply lines, both our own as well as what we're doing with our partners. We are judging where we expect demand to be out in time, but we don't have any certainty around it. And those are -- it's a multivariable equation, that if you project out under certain circumstances, certain assumptions that you make that we can in the second half of the year begin to get closer to that 26 week lead time. We could be wrong. The demand could come back roaring in the second half that we're not thinking about as it did in '21 -- 2020 and 2021. But under a reasonable set of expectations that we are internally modeling but we're not externally communicating, we think that's what we can get to. And we think that's where we need to get to, to kind of run this business on a consistent basis and have it as a strong way in which our customers and us together can plan for business.
Stephen Sanghi: Let me add to that a bit. Let me add a bit to the answer. As you have seen, many of our competitors and others in the semiconductor industry actually go down sequentially for the last couple of quarters, and most of them are guiding down for the March quarter. We have been growing every quarter. And Ganesh mentioned that earlier, has to do with our end market mix, focus on mega trends, focus on total system solutions, and we've been gaining share. So not having gone down all this time, and still guiding growth in March as well as June quarter. When you get to the second half, it's quite possible that others are saying second half demand will pick up again, that we get the wind on the back in the second half while never had gone down in the last two quarters and the forward looking couple of quarters. So that's the thesis of soft landing where we just didn't go down so far, and we pick up wind again in the second half. So looking at the that way, how we are differentiating ourselves.
Ganesh Moorthy: And by the way, you can go back in 2020 and look at the fourth quarter performance in 2020 and you will see that we had barely a ripple in the first half and strong growth in the second half.
Ambrish Srivastava: Right. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the commentary on higher inventory levels driven by some of the supply and demand dislocations in China due to the easing of the zero-COVID policy, it looks like you guys are proactively helping customers here by pushing out shipments, maybe decreasing your sell-in into the channels in that region. Does this imply that within your March quarter guidance, that China region revenues will be down sequentially? And just given that China is through the first waves of COVID here this quarter, are you starting to see some signs of demand improvement?
Ganesh Moorthy: So while we don't break out guidance by end market, in the March quarter, China -- Greater China has always had a decline. There are 7 to 10 days of holidays for Chinese New Year. And we don't expect this year is any different. What we are cautiously optimistic is that with the worst of COVID behind in the December and January time frame, that post Chinese New Year, which is right about now, China will come back and have a more constructive approach to where their economy and therefore, our business will go as well. I can't give you that as an absolute it's going to go happen. And so we are modeling for a normal China quarter this quarter and something more could happen depending on how business comes back post-Chinese New Year.
Harlan Sur: Thanks, Ganesh.
Stephen Sanghi: In vast number of cases, majority of the cases when we help the customer in China or distributor to not get the product because they had inventory, we had so much other demand for that product in U.S. or Europe, and other customers because we're still carrying huge amount of unsupported backlog. So in most cases, where we accommodated a customer, we ship that product to somebody else.
Harlan Sur: Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thanks, Harlan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please proceed.
Matthew Myers: Hey, guys. This is Matt Myers on for Chris. I just wanted to circle back on your PSP for a second. I was curious because you guys have said in the past that your PSP is well over 50% of your backlog. I was just curious where that is now, and what the differences are between PSP versus non-PSP backlog?
Ganesh Moorthy: It remains well over 50% to this day.
Matthew Myers: Got it. That's helpful. And then do you have any updates on utilizations and how they've changed in the quarter and kind of what your expectations are going ahead?
James Eric Bjornholt: So really, really no change. The manufacturing facilities are running hard. So we've been bringing in a lot of equipment and bringing that online. So no real change to report there.
Matthew Myers: All right. Thank you.
Stephen Sanghi: I mean utilization is essentially 100%, right?
Matthew Myers: Yes.
Stephen Sanghi: Every wafer we can move and every unit we can move to the factory, we're moving it.
Matthew Myers: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes. Hi, guys. Good quarter and guide here. Just a quick question on the -- on inventory levels. I was wondering if you could give some color on what [indiscernible] look like at the customer side, if you were to look at the different segments, industrial or orders?
James Eric Bjornholt: We don't really have that information to share. We just have anecdotal information from individual customer conversations, Vijay. So we don't get any sort of reporting on inventory being held by any of the end customers. We get that through distribution, and we shared that in my prepared remarks, the distribution inventory was up 3days in the quarter. Outside of that, I don't have anything else to say. I don't know if Ganesh or Steve would add anything.
Ganesh Moorthy: The only thing I would say is that we don't have a customer that is so large that their business or their inventory would change our business materially. You can take any of the customers and if they are public companies, you can do an analysis of what inventory they carry. And we do that, but we don't know what the inventory is. And in many cases where we are shipping product that is from constrained corridors from legacy technologies that don't have as much excess capacity. We don't believe our inventories are what they're carrying. But honestly, we don't know and they don't report the same way as our distribution channel partners report to us.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And then on the lead times, obviously, a good thing that they are coming in. But is that a function of broad industry supply improving? Or is it more a reflection of demand? Or how would you parse it? I guess, especially if we look at the different markets, right, every market may be different?
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, you need both sides of that equation, right? So our supply lines are improving. The fact that parts of the industry have slowed down, has opened up capacity incrementally to us. Our lead times are still long. And it's really -- there's a tremendous amount of work we have to do over the next 6, 9, 12 months to one by one by one, get it back into a range. And we're still expecting that the 26 weeks is kind of an average lead time. We are going to have some that are longer, some that are shorter than where we go. But directionally, it's where we want to go. It's what makes it constructive for our customers to plan better and for us to serve them better.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. Please proceed.
Chris Danely: Hey, thanks guys. I guess one clarification and a question. You seem to indicate that there was some weakness in China, but I think Ganesh or Steve, you just mentioned that you're planning for a normal quarter in China in Q1. So any delineation there? And then for the question, you mentioned that some "other customers" have too much inventory. Is there any rhyme or reason there? Any commonality between end markets or geographies? Or is it just sort of spread out all over the place? Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: Let me take them one by one. So what I said was that China had weakness in the December quarter, and they were from two different COVID events. First, the lockdowns, then the reopening and the spread of COVID that took place. And that caused havoc at many, many of our customers and where it was at. We are expecting that those are behind us in this quarter, and that's what the information we have and the early signs we have are. And so a good chunk of this quarter is still ahead of us. We've just gone through January, almost 10 days of that were used for the Chinese New Year. And so we have all of February and all of March. And so in that context, we think China will be normal in this quarter. There's no incremental weakness compared to last quarter. And in fact, the COVID issues are largely behind where they were last quarter. In terms of customers who have inventory position, this is not something new. We've mentioned it in prior quarters as well is that if someone self-identifies as having product that they would like to get later, we will take that information and find other customers to the extent we can who can use that product and are short today so that we match where there is a supply-demand imbalance, but it's in the customer's location to be able to do it. And there's no particular end market where that is giving us grievance, et cetera. Clearly, the whole appliance market is one relative to some of the others where there is more weakness than that. But there's always going to be customers who can be in any end market who ask for relief to be able to help other customers. And we will, to the extent we can.
Chris Danely: Got it. Thanks, Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: You’re welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I have a question about the manufacturing plan, given your decision not to go forward with the 300-millimeter investment. I guess for one, just what's driving that decision? And does that remove any possibility of internal capacity expansion going forward? And then following that, what do you think that means for Microchip competitively? Are you confident in your ability to get third-party wafers at competitive prices to support your growth going forward?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. So let me parse your question. So number one, we are continuing to expand the existing facilities we have. Those are the three fabs in the U.S., our assembly and test facilities in the Far East, et cetera. So there is no backing off from capacity where we believe we can bring on cost effective capacity that will go forward. Now 300-millimeter was a fairly large step for us, right? We don't have that infrastructure. We had a lot of thinking to do on how would we load a fab because you can build a fab and you can get the help to get the government funding, whatever else, to do that. But still, at the end of the day, there are several things that are important to have. And the most important one is do you have enough wafers to load it and have the cost per wafer and the absorption cost effective or not. That was going to be a challenge we knew at all times. And second, we need to be able to license the technologies because unlike in 200-millimeter where we own the vast majority of our technologies, in 300-millimeters, we would need to license that technology from our partners. That all said, as we looked at on balance, how could we achieve our business objectives. In the conversations we were able to have at the highest levels of our partners, we came away with plans and commitments for what was needed to support our business that we felt very confident that being able to work in the model we have today with our partners was completely supportive of our business and substantially derisk the execution of a greenfield 300-millimeter fab.
Chris Caso: Okay. Thank you. As a follow-up, there's obviously been a lot of discussion about the PSP program. And I wanted to ask on it, in the context of as you achieve your goals of getting lead times down, what do you expect your customers' reaction to be? Obviously, the PSP program and bookings so far ahead was something we hadn't typically seen in the industry for Microchip generally. Do you expect that customers would naturally wean themselves off of PSP or at least put a smaller part of the backlog in PSP if the lead times come down? And clearly, it sounds like that's not happening right now.
Ganesh Moorthy: It's -- the jury is still out. But let me tell you right in the middle of all of this, we continue to have customers approaching us for long-term supply agreements, long-term supply agreements that are predominantly in a 5-year window of time. So many, many of our customers build substantially valuable end equipment. I mean if you think of aerospace defense, commercial aviation, medical, automotive, many of the large industrial equipment, et cetera, they are trying to have assurance of supply as the most critical element of what they are planning for. Now how they want to do it with us, whether it is standard backlog, PSP backlog, long-term supply agreements is really a business decision that they need to make on the risk rewards or where they want to go. But I can tell you that for the customers that we're dealing with for many, many, many of them, the value of the supply assurance is extremely high on their agenda and is the reason why they are continuing to be a participant in the PSP program and signing up to be an increasing number of long-term supply agreements that they're signing up for.
Stephen Sanghi: We said in our prepared remarks that we collected $385 million just last quarter from customers who signed up for a long-term supply agreement. So our customers do not see the environment that has lots of excess capacity and people are shutting down factories and laying off people. The capacity on the nodes that we use is still largely constrained and customers are still concerned about getting long-term capacity, and they're giving us money and signing up long-term supply agreements for us to put that capacity in place ourselves or to sign up with our foundry partners.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes, Chris, a lot of conversations are taking place at the CEO, CPO levels for these. And I think customers are much more thoughtful about a long-term view. They're not looking at a one or two quarter. The cycle may be slower than what we thought. They're as much worried about what happens in 2024 and what happens in 2025 and how do they build a supply chain that is reliable, resilient and enables their growth on these very, very high valued and equipment.
Chris Caso: Got it. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. I guess, I just wonder how you see the progression of bookings here. You've got this elevated backlog. You have lead times coming in. It seems like the book-to-bill should go pretty far below 1, but then we probably -- it's just math at that point, it's not really that there's an air pocket at the end. But I guess, historically, a lot of times, there's been air pockets at the end. So as -- I know you guys have seen a lot of these types of environments. Just how are you thinking about it? And how will you know if that lead time reduction means you need to take more action to kind of -- the actions you've already discussed to protect your earnings power?
Ganesh Moorthy: Joe, book-to-bill in our business has never been a meaningful indicator. We're making proprietary products, but the customer doesn't buy from anybody else. It has always been an indicator of what is the customer sentiment about where the business is going and what kind of lead times are they going to have to prepare for. So clearly, in an environment in which lead times will start to come in, customers will pull back on some of the bookings. And I actually -- I said that in my prepared remarks as well. It doesn't mean that their needs have changed. It doesn't mean that their usage patterns are going to change, right? It's just how they want to work with us. Now customers also have been burned pretty badly over the last couple of years on trying to kind of optimize the last 5% of where they're going to hold inventory, et cetera. And so they do have an approach that is not tactical. They're trying to be more strategic in how they think about things. And where the bookings are low, our bookings are high, we know that they're going to come. And if I go back four quarters ago, bookings were out of this world. And we were seeing levels of bookings that were incredible. But that didn't mean we expected business was going to double next quarter or the quarter after that. They were being placed out in time. And so we feel good about where our backlog still is. We still have multiple quarters of backlog. We are still getting bookings that are coming in at a lower rate, but we think they're high-quality bookings because we're not expecting that they have to place backlog beyond a point where they're comfortable with. So I think it's a good environment at this point and bookings are low, but that's okay.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for the follow-up. Actually, just a comment and a question. Comment, if I just annualize your March quarter guidance, it suggests annual sales growth somewhere in the 10% to 11% for this year, and I just wanted to make sure that, that is kind of the message you are giving. My question is on gross margin. Usually, when you grow sales, you have been able to grow gross margin. But I know I'm nitpicking, but I think for March, you are guiding gross margins to go down somewhat and you're also kind of at the higher end of your gross margin outlook. So what's happening to gross margins? Why are they going down? And is 68.5% kind of that final destination or is there more leverage in the model?
James Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So I will take both the questions and Ganesh or Steve can add on to it. So you're asking a guidance for the next year, does 10% or 11% make sense. We've made no comment beyond what we are going to grow in the March quarter other than we will grow again in the June quarter. So I can't really provide any color on what you're saying there. On gross margin, we are actually guiding gross margins to be up modestly in the quarter. Last quarter, we were at 68.1% non-GAAP gross margin. And if you look at the guidance table in our release, the midpoint of guidance is 68.2%. There's a GAAP and a non-GAAP column in there, and maybe you're just looking at the wrong one, but non-GAAP and GAAP margins should both be up in the quarter.
Vivek Arya: And any leverage beyond the 68.5%, Eric?
James Eric Bjornholt: So we aren't at 68.5% yet. We are guiding to 68.2%. Our long-term model is a range of 67.5% to 68.5%. And we've done extremely well. We got to where we are very quickly. We just announced those targets at our Analyst Day in November of 2021. And we are always looking to continuously improve. So I would say that over time, as the top line grows, we think we will be efficient. We will be introducing highly value-added products that can drive higher gross margins, but we have not changed that target at this point.
Ganesh Moorthy: And Vivek, we're always balancing growth and gross margin, right? We want both. And so we got to be careful that we don't take one up so high that it affects the other. So we will improve, but we also want growth to continue at the rate that we want.
Vivek Arya: Understood. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes again from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Harlan Sur: Yes, thank you for the follow-up. So with fiscal '23 almost behind us, wondering if you have an update for us on your total system solution strategy. I went to two of your major distributors' websites and I think they listed over 4,000 reference designs for Microchip, and that's up substantially from a few years ago. How effective are these reference designs in helping to drive TSS? And do you have any metrics you can share with us on increasing dollar content for customer engagement?
Ganesh Moorthy: So clearly, the reference designs, both ourselves, our partners and how we go are a key element of how we go and provide total system solutions. But really, we've taken it from just reference designs and products at the design stage to how are we conceiving our solutions, how our businesses working together to create products in parallel that together create the hardware, software and services that are needed for customers to be able to adopt a large portion of their design with our products. And so it's a complex set of processes that we are working on. You're seeing some of the benefits in terms of the differential results that you've seen with us. There is not an easy equation I can plug into that tells you, okay, this is the rate at which it's going. But you can see in the total results for the company, and it does come from years of honing in all aspects of the total system solutions from development to go-to-market to sales to how do we ensure that those designs stay and stay sticky with the Microchip solutions.
Harlan Sur: Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thanks, Harlan.
Operator: Our next question comes again from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed. Ambrish, your line is now live.
Ambrish Srivastava: Sorry about that. Thank you. Thank you for accommodating me in a follow-up. I had a question on 300-millimeters, Steve. I thought when you started to talk about it, you made a very compelling argument of why there hasn't been enough capacity, and then ROIC is a very compelling argument of why not doing it. I just wanted to make sure I understand the comment you made, Ganesh, that with your partners, you feel comfortable that they would be investing and we won't be back to that again in a -- I don't know how many quarters from now that we're again sitting here and saying, hey, look, there isn't enough capacity. So we feel comfortable enough to not go forward because of the commitment from your partners. Is that the right takeaway?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. So we've had extensive discussions about options by which we could move forward, options that our partners were exercised to be able to support what we need, and we’ve had those at the highest levels of our partners' management. And we are confident that what we need in partnership with our supply chain -- our key supply chain partners can be met. And as I said, it does it at a far lower risk and a far better ROIC.
Ambrish Srivastava: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Moorthy, I'd like to turn the call back to you for closing remarks.
Ganesh Moorthy: Great. Thank you, and thank you to everyone who joined us on the call today, and we will be seeing many of you on some of the events that are coming up this quarter, but have a good evening. Bye-bye.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q2  (2022-11-03 17:00:00) =====
James Eric Bjornholt: [Technical Difficulty] Is a record $814.4 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.46, and at the high-end of our guidance range. On a GAAP basis in the September quarter, gross margins were a record at 67.4%. Total operating expenses were $642.8 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $167.5 million, special charges of $4.3 million, $3.2 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $34.8 million. GAAP net income was a record $546.2 million resulting in a record $0.98 in earnings per diluted share and was adversely impacted by a $2.1 million loss on debt settlement associated with our convertible debt refinancing activities. Our September quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably the tax expense recorded as a result of the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 11.2% in the September quarter. We now expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '23 to be between 9.8% and 10.8%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. This is modestly higher than our previous forecast as we have refined our tax calculations for the year. A reminder of what we communicated last quarter, our fiscal '23 cash tax rate is higher than our fiscal '22 tax rate for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes such as net operating losses and tax credits as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. There appears to be some momentum for the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses to be pushed out or repealed. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 300 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchip's tax rate in fiscal year 2023. Our inventory balance at September 30, 2022, was $1.03 billion. We had 139 days of inventory at the end of the September quarter which was up 12 days from the prior quarter's level. We have increased our raw materials inventory to protect our internal manufacturing supply lines. We are carrying higher work in progress to maximize the utilization of constrained equipment as well as to position ourselves to take advantage of new equipment installations which will relieve bottlenecks. We are investing and building inventory for long-life, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners. We need to ensure that our supply lines can feed growth beyond what we expect in the December 2022 and March 2023 quarters and our reported days of inventory is a backward-looking indicator. As gross margins rise, the effective days of inventory for the same physical inventory rises and with every 100 basis points of gross margin growth, it creates approximately 3 incremental days of inventory. Inventory days at our distributors in the September quarter was at 19 days which was flat to the prior quarter's level. With distribution inventory still being low, we will be carrying higher inventory at Microchip to ensure our customers can be served. In the September quarter, we repurchased $36.9 million of principal value of our 2025 and 2027 convertible subordinated notes for cash and we also paid cash for the value of these bonds above the principal amount which was an additional $60 million. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the amount of the convertible debt repurchases and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time. The principal amount of convertible debt on our balance sheet at September 30 was $766.6 million. This includes $665.5 million of convertible bonds maturing in November of 2024 with the cap call option in place that offsets any potential dilution from these convertibles up to stock prices of $116.15. At the beginning of calendar year 2020, Microchip had $4.481 billion of convertible bonds outstanding. So today, our overall capital structure is in a much better long-term position. Our cash flow from operating activities was $793.2 million in the September quarter. Our free cash flow was $682.9 million and 32.9% of net sales. As of September 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $306.8 million. We paid down $264.9 million of total debt in the September quarter and our net debt was reduced by $192.6 million. Over the last 17 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $5.5 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt. Our adjusted EBITDA in the September quarter was a record at $1.056 billion and 50.9% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $3.814 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was $1.84 at September 30, 2022, down from 2.05 at June 30, 2022 and down from 3.0 at September 30, 2021. Capital expenditures were $110.3 million in the September quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 is between $500 million and $550 million as we continue to take actions to support the growth of our business and the ramp of our manufacturing operations. We continue to prudently add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected long-term growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $63.6 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter as well as our guidance for the December quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric and good afternoon, everyone. Our September quarter results continued to be strong, driven by our disciplined execution and our resilient end markets. Net sales grew 5.6% sequentially and 25.7% on a year-over-year basis to achieve another all-time record at $2.07 billion. While we don't normally provide information on a distribution sell-through basis which we refer to as end market demand, we are providing information this quarter to give investors some insight into consumption. September quarter end market demand grew sequentially at about the same rate as our GAAP net sales which is based on sell-in recognition. The September quarter was our eighth consecutive quarter where we achieved a net sales record and the first time we have ever crossed the $8 billion annualized net sales mark. Non-GAAP gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance at a record 67.7%, up 64 basis points from the June quarter and up 244 basis points from the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin came in well above the high end of our guidance at a record 46.9%, up 127 basis points from the June quarter and up 438 basis points from the year ago quarter. Due to a rapid increase in net sales over the last 2 years, operating expenses at 20.9% were about 160 basis points below the low end of our long-term model range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Our long-term operating expense model will continue to guide our investment actions to drive the long-term growth, profitability and durability of our business. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS was a record $1.46 per share, up 36.4% from the year ago quarter and at the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA at 50.9% of net sales and free cash flow at 32.9% of net sales were both very strong in the September quarter, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation capabilities of our business. Net debt declined by $192.6 million, driving our net leverage ratio down to 1.84x, exiting the September quarter. During the September quarter, we returned $413.3 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, representing 57.5% of the prior quarter's free cash flow. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding results and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team for their continued efforts during challenging times to deliver results for our customers despite a large and persistent imbalance between supply and demand. Taking a look at our net sales from a product line perspective, our Microcontroller net sales were sequentially up 11% as compared to the June quarter and set another all-time record. On a year-over-year basis, our September quarter microcontroller net sales were up 31.9% and microcontrollers represented 56.9% of our net sales in the September quarter. Our analog net sales sequentially decreased 1.3% in the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our September quarter analog net sales were up 16.6% and analog represented 27.6% of our net sales in the September quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, there are quarter-to-quarter differences in supply constraints which can cause differences in net sales growth by product line. If you compare the trailing 4-quarter net sales growth performance versus the prior 4 quarters for our analog and microcontroller product lines, the growth rates are almost exactly the same. In the September quarter, our technology licensing net sales achieved a new record. Business conditions continue to be strong as viewed through our internal indicators. Demand continued to be strong despite the capacity increases we have been implementing for some time now. As a result, our unsupported backlog which represents backlog customers wanted ship to them in the September quarter but which we could not deliver in the September quarter, climbed again. And we exited the September quarter with our highest unsupported backlog ever, with unsupported backlog well above the actual net sales we achieved. We are working hard to reduce our unsupported backlog to more manageable levels and expect to do so in the coming quarters but also expect to remain supply constrained through the rest of 2022 and well into 2023. We are, of course, cognizant of the weakening macro conditions resulting from rising inflation and interest rates and are monitoring such conditions closely. We're also aware that there is some inventory build at our customers as can be seen in their balance sheets. Some of this, we believe, is due to strategic buffer inventory builds arising from the learnings of the last 2 years and some of this is due to the incomplete kits of the infamous golden screw effect. While we have seen an increase in requests to push out or cancel backlog, these requests remain a very small fraction of the very large backlog we have over multiple quarters and hence, they have not had a material impact on our business. We believe there are 3 reasons why Microchip's business is demonstrating more resilience in the midst of the weakness seen by some of the other semiconductor companies. First, on the demand side, the industrial, automotive, aerospace and defense, data center and communications infrastructure end markets which make up 86% of our net sales, remain strong. The consumer end market which is about 14% of our net sales is experiencing some weakness but is dominated by home appliances. And home appliances are more resilient than other consumer markets as a high percentage of demand comes from replacements for appliances which have broken down and must be replaced. Hence, our demand is quite durable because of the end market mix we have consciously gravitated towards over the years. Second, on the supply side, a vast majority of our products are built on specialized technologies requiring trailing edge capacity. This is the capacity that has been most constrained over the last 2 years which still remains constrained and where there was the least opportunity to overship consumption. And last but not least, our laser focus on organic growth through total system solutions and higher-growth megatrends for multiple years is giving us increased design win momentum and a resultant revenue tailwind. Given the crosscurrents of strong internal business indicators and some uncertainty in the macro environment, we have modeled a range of potential scenarios and are closely monitoring various indicators which should enable us to take deliberate action when we feel it's appropriate. Our goal is to deliver a soft landing for our business, if or when there is a softer macro environment catches up with it. The playbook we shared with you last quarter for how we will deal with the macro slowdown remains unchanged. If you study Microchip's peak-to-trough performance through the business cycles over the last 15 years, you will observe our robust and consistent cash generation, gross margin and operating margin results. The investor presentation posted on our IR website provides details about our performance through the business cycles. If or when there is a macro slowdown and that impacts our business, we expect our cash generation gross margin and operating margin to once again demonstrate consistency and resiliency. This will help us continue to execute our long-term Microchip 3.0 strategy and help insulate it from whatever short-term market challenges there may be. While we are seeing some loosening of constraints in our supply chain, we continue to have several internal and external capacity corridors that remain very constrained. We are continuing with our carefully calibrated capacity increases seeking to serve what we believe is a long-term consumption growth. We believe our calibrated increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, serve our customers that are increase our market share, improve our gross margins and give us more control over our destiny, especially for specialized trailing edge technologies. As you may have seen, Microchip has expressed its view that the recently approved CHIPS Act is good for the semiconductor industry and for America that enables critical investments which will even the global playing field for U.S. companies while being strategically important for our economic and national security. For a very long time, an important component of our business strategy has been to own and operate a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources, including wafer fabrication facilities in the U.S. This strategy enables us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control, resulting in us being one of the lowest-cost producers in the embedded control industry. In light of this strategy and potential grant funding from the CHIPS Act, the investment tax credit provision as well as state and local grants and subsidies. Microchip is in the early stages of considering a 300-millimeter U.S.-based fab for specialized trailing edge technologies. This fab project, if we decide to pursue it, would be intended to provide competitive growth capacity as well as geographic and geopolitical diversification. The availability of grants, subsidies and other incentives will all be important considerations in our analysis and will also help determine the location and timing for the fab. Now let's get into the guidance for the December quarter. Our backlog for the December quarter is strong and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the December quarter to be up between 3% and 5% sequentially. We also expect our net sales based on end market demand to grow at about the same growth as our GAAP net sales. And further, we expect sequential net sales growth again in the March quarter. At the midpoint of our net sales guidance, our year-over-year growth for the December quarter would be a strong 22.7%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 67.8% and 68% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 20.7% and 20.9% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 46.9% and 47.3% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.54 per share and $1.56 per share. At the midpoint of our EPS guidance, our year-over-year growth for the December quarter would be a strong 29.2%. Finally, as you can see from our September quarter results and our December quarter guidance, our Microchip 3.0 strategy which we launched a year ago, is firing on all cylinders, as we continue to build and improve what we believe is one of the most diversified, defensible, high-growth, high-margin, high cash-generating businesses in the semiconductor industry. Let me now pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?
Stephen Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter while making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non-GAAP EPS and record adjusted EBITDA and all of that in a very challenging supply environment. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 9% from last quarter to $0.328 per share. This is an increase of 41.4% from the year ago quarter. During the last quarter, we purchased $247.2 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $166.1 million in dividends Thus, the total cash return was $413.3 million. This amount was 57.5% of our actual free cash flow of $718.5 million during the June 2022 quarter. Our paydown of debt as well as record adjusted EBITDA drove down our net leverage at the end of September 2022 quarter to 1.84 from 2.05 at the end of June. Ever since we achieved investment-grade rating for our debt in November of 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $1.457 billion to shareholders through September 30, 2022, by a combination of dividends and share buybacks. In the December quarter, we will use the September quarter's actual free cash flow of $682.9 million and plan to return 60% or $409.7 million of that amount to our shareholders. Of this $409.7 million, the dividend is expected to be approximately $181 million. And the stock buyback is expected to be approximately $22.7 million. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Ambrish Srivastava of BMO has our first question.
Ambrish Srivastava: It’s very appreciated that you put the investor slide deck where you talk about the playbook and the scenarios and you’ve talked about the playbook. But I just can’t help ask this question because weakness is rampant. It’s everywhere. Many of your diversified peers have talked about weakness. Just kind of help us understand, the big concern I have is the longer the lead time stays stressed out, the higher the possibility of a harder landing. So just kind of help us understand, how are you managing the soft landing that you have addressed a few times but I just wanted to readdress that issue, if you could, please.
Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So it starts with having high-quality backlog. And PSP being a high percentage of our backlog, well over 50%, is the highest-quality backlog. It is noncancelable. It's customers who have put time into making a commitment to be noncancelable and that is always going to have far more thought that goes into it. It starts also with the supply side where we are making calibrated investments every quarter. We're not trying to go satisfy all the demand that's out there. And our lead times are long but they've also, in specific areas, started to improve. And that helps with customers who have visibility out in time. And then the end market exposure we have is another huge benefit to us, right? Most of these customers in these end markets are not in volatile markets where things can go up and down in short order. They're looking at the long-term. They're looking at demand that is far more durable. And you put all that together and we feel we have a model that is outperforming and for those reasons, from a market standpoint, supply standpoint and what we have done for ourselves in terms of total system solutions and the mega trends we're focused on and the design-in activity that we have pursued.
Ambrish Srivastava: Okay. Just a quick follow-up. Where are the lead times now on a -- and I know the product line is very diverse but the way you characterize it, what percent of lead times are -- have come in versus staying at 52-plus weeks?
Ganesh Moorthy: The lead times are all over the place. We have some lead times which are as low as 4 to 8 weeks. We have a lot of them which are at 26 to 52 weeks. It's corridor by corridor, product by product, where the constraints are, right? We go to work every day trying to improve it. And as long as supply improves, we're able to do that. Demand remains still strong. So there’s not a single number I can give you or a single percentage that I can say, “Hey, this is what the lead times are at.” But most importantly, it’s not just the lead times, it’s also how strong the demand is. And you can see with some of the end market data that we provide you the information on the growth, right? The end market growth is keeping pace with what we’re shipping in to -- on a GAAP basis.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities.
Vivek Arya: For the first one, it’s very interesting you’re considering a 300-millimeter fab. I was wondering what is driving that decision? What kind of CapEx will it require? Will it have any impact on your dividend or buyback philosophy? And does it mean you will bring back some of what you’re giving to external foundries inside the company? Just any more color on the 300-millimeter fab. I appreciate it’s probably still in early stages of discussion.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. So you should look at it as it's a very strategic thought process and decision for us. It's something we think about over a 20-year-plus time frame of what it will do for us. Not unlike how when we bought our Gresham fab just about 20 years ago, right? It was a long-term investment that we made. We have many processes that are at 300 millimeters that our candidates. We have some specific ones we would look at as the early ones we bring in. But I wouldn't look at it as necessarily just bringing all the stuff inside as much as, as we grow, we would have additional places where it can grow. This investment will happen over multiple years. It will be largely within the range of the CapEx that we have provided and that we do not expect it to have either an impact on our dividend or our share buyback or anything else with where we're at.
Vivek Arya: And for my follow-up, I think, Ganesh, you mentioned that one reason that you might be seeing the strength as some customers are building some buffer inventory. I'm curious how far along do you think they are in that process? And does it just pull forward their demand from outer quarters? Because I think what everyone is trying to get a sense for is that in most prior downturns, Microchip was always the first one to signal when the macro conditions weakened this time conditions are weakening, every one of your competitors is saying that yet you're not seeing it. So what has changed versus your analog industrial peers? I can understand the consumer part but what’s different versus your peers who are also exposed to the same automotive industrial type markets. Are you there? [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: Please remain on the line while we reconnect our presenters. You may proceed.
Ganesh Moorthy: We're back. Vivek, if you're still on, we didn't get the entirety of your question. Would you repeat your question, please?
Vivek Arya: Yes. So basically, what I asked, Ganesh, was that you mentioned customers are building buffer inventory. I was just wondering how far along they are in that process. And in general, if you contrast Microchip today, versus in prior downturns, right, when you had a somewhat similar mix of products, the company was always the first to see the downturn but you’re not seeing it now. So I was curious what is the difference between the old Microchip versus the new Microchip.
Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So let me answer the second one first. If you look at the old Microchip, we had more exposure to markets that perhaps are more volatile, right? We didn't have the same aerospace and defense, data center infrastructure. We weren't as high in industrial and automotive. And those are far more durable, right? We had a much higher consumer exposure if you go back 10 years or the financial crisis in that time frame. So that has changed to where we can see the customer and their end market demand as being far more durable today than it was in history. On your first question about what about the buffer. I think the amount that's being built is small because we're not able to ship, right? I mean we're constrained in our ability to service all this backlog that is unsupported. But anecdotally, are there going to be some customers who are building in? Yes, we're sure there is some of that. But we still think it's small. And mostly, it is in the markets where there's a very large multiplier for the OEMs end product as compared to the value of the semiconductors that they're carrying..
Operator: Christopher Rolland, Susquehanna.
Christopher Rolland: I guess my first one is for either Steve or Ganesh. So you had confidence enough to provide growth into March which is pretty incredible in this environment. Is this -- do you think you have this confidence and this visibility because of your kind of tough stance on your NCNR policy? Is it perhaps you’re looking to channel inventories and keeping those tight? Is there some other difference here operationally or that kind of affects your confidence versus others out there? Is there something you’re doing different?
Ganesh Moorthy: So firstly, we have confidence both on the demand side as well as the improving supply that we're making. But let me put it in perspective, right? Even if we accepted 100% of all the cancellation and pushout requests of noncancelable backlog, this factor alone would not have changed our September quarter results, our December quarter guidance and we would remain poised to grow sequentially again in March. So don't assume that it's the non-cancelability that is somehow propping us up.
Christopher Rolland: Great. Steve, you’ve talked before about industry capacity being tight for -- and us not having enough as an industry moving forward. I think there's probably been some cancellations in terms of equipment and stuff like that but would love an update here, you -- how you feel about that? Are you even more strong in that belief? And is that what underpins the 300-millimeter thought process as well?
Stephen Sanghi: Right. So it began 1.5 years ago with capacity being constrained at all the nodes, trailing edge, leading edge and the middle of the way. What has happened in the last few quarters is with the personal computers and cell phones which are significant consumers of semiconductor and mostly semiconductors on the bleeding edge of technology processors and very high-end chips in the cellular phone. With the production in that market, the leading -- bleeding edge capacity now is really no longer constrained. You have seen dramatic downside guidance by a lot of the very leading-edge people. So today, if you wanted a 7-nanometer, 10-nanometer 14-nanometer capacity, you can have everything you need. But the trailing-edge capacity continues to be extremely constrained. On trailing edge, we built some inside and we also bought some from the foundries and we are constrained on both. Inside, we haven’t been able to get all the equipment we wanted. Most equipment that was even scheduled to be delivered got pushed out by many months, sometimes many quarters because the equipment supplier wasn’t able to get semiconductors for their parts. So the inside products that we’ve done inside remain constrained on many different corridors. And the capacity we buy outside is really very similar. The trailing edge capacity remains constrained and we currently believe will remain constrained well into 2023.
Ganesh Moorthy: I would add one more thing, right? I think on 300-millimeter, where -- if we started on a fab tomorrow, it's 4-plus years away before that fab is starting to ramp. So these are not decisions we make in a single cycle. We think through these across cycles on a long-term secular growth basis and what our position is and what we want our capabilities to be out in time.
Stephen Sanghi: And on the prior question, we were talking about backlog and why we are so resilient and in the prior cycle that we used to be the first one to see this and why we're not seeing it today. I think I wanted to add a comment -- a couple of comments. One that Ganesh mentioned which is a dramatically different end market mix we have today than when you used to call the canary in the coal mine. And secondly, I think we want to keep emphasizing that PSP backlog is a very high-quality backlog. When a customer has to commit 12 months and in some cases, 18 months and longer noncancelable, non-reschedulable backlog, there is a lot more thought that goes into it. And it's not the junior purchasing manager who places the backlog. It goes up for approval. So it's a much, much higher-quality backlog. And people don't just double order it thinking that they would cancel it because it's noncancelable. They don't double order it thinking that Microchip would let them change the rules, then we'll let them cancel it. So that backlog is very high quality. We've gotten very small number of scattered requests here and there. And as Ganesh mentioned, if we were to take all of them for cancellation, it wouldn't change anything. It would not change our September, December or March. It's just a minuscule percentage. It really means nothing almost; so take that into account. We've heard from a lot of investors and analysts that think PSP is some sort of accident to happen because people are building inventory and we're not letting them cancel it and the fall would be even harder. I think that thinking is not correct.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Timothy Arcuri of UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: You mentioned PSP is more than half of backlog but can you talk about how much of the September revenue is moving inside of PSP? And maybe, Steve, I know that you just made some comments about some requests for changes within PSP. It sounds like they’re still pretty small. But I guess can you also just double click on the comment you just made because PSP doesn’t really change demand. I mean, to a certain degree, you just put product to customers that might not need it because they committed to it 6 to 12 months ago. So can you just kind of talk through that and then maybe answer the question about how much revenue is moving inside of PSP.
Ganesh Moorthy: So firstly, in a given quarter, by the time we get to that quarter, is an overwhelming percentage of what we ship in that quarter. That's what customers who place backlog back in time, receive priority for it, expect. And that's what we give them. And so further out in time, there is more space and new backlog can come in and fill it out. But near term, like what just happened in September or what is going to happen in December, has a very, very high percentage of it that is PSP backlog that is being fulfilled. Let me reiterate the point Steve made and which I made a little bit earlier on. PSP backlog is the highest-quality backlog is there. We make noncancelable commitments to our suppliers and we don't make them lightly because there is a financial commitment that is required to have enough scrutiny. Similarly, our customers have significant scrutiny when they're trying to make commitments. They don't try to get excess capacity order from us. They, in fact, will try to undershoot so that they can actually hit it. So I want you to take from this that PSP backlog is the highest-quality backlog. We have far more cancellations and request on non-PSP but PSP backlog is very high quality.
James Eric Bjornholt: And even outside PSP, I want to note that our standard cancellation window is 90 days. So when we enter a quarter, really, everything that's on books for the quarter is noncancelable, whether it's PSP or not.
Stephen Sanghi: You should also think that when we took the PSP backlog and for the last 1.5 years, in the middle of extreme constraints, we made a choice to ship to the PSP customers and not ship to the non-PSP customers. All the non-PSP customers are not low-quality customers. Some of them are very good customers but their business is such that they cannot make a 1-year commitment, so they were non-PSP customers. They got very little product. So we made a choice to prioritize giving it to PSP customers and let the other customers go, not get product, get somewhere else. So our PSP customers have benefited from the best of our attention in the last 1.5 years. And now they can have the best of them and then be flexible and not really meet their part of the bargain. We have added capacity for them. We prioritize them. We lost the other customers when we did not give any product. So I think this…
Ganesh Moorthy: I would say don't be fixated on it. This is our best demand. It's our best customer.
Timothy Arcuri: Got it. Got it. And then just as my follow-up. So you gave sort of some view on consumption and you called it end market demand. Does that include the inventory that's building at your customers? When you talk about end market demand, is that net of the inventory build at your customers? Or is that inclusive of the inventory build at your customers?
James Eric Bjornholt: So when we speak of end market demand, it is everything that we ship to our direct customers which is no different than GAAP revenue. And then the other difference is that roughly 50% of our business that goes through distribution, it represents the distributors' sell-through to their customers rather than what we're selling into the distribution channel. We do not have any kind of view in terms of exactly what our customers are doing with inventory. We service 125,000 customers and that’s just not data that we have or is possible for us to track.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. When we talk about potential inventory at customers, all we can see is what do they publicly report. But I can tell you that the level of expedites and customer escalations we're experiencing remain high, indicating the demand supplier imbalance for many customer situations.
Operator: Our next question comes from William Stein of Truist Securities.
William Stein: First, a little bit of an off-the-run question and then I will have a follow-up. OpEx, I think you highlighted that it’s below your target range as revenue continues to grow and you’re not spending as much as sort of you would normally target. Over what time frame should we anticipate your OpEx approaching your target percent of revenue?
Ganesh Moorthy: It will be over many quarters. You can see in our guidance which is not happening in the December quarter. the hiring environment has been difficult. Perhaps we will do better as we go into 2023. So it will be slow. Eric, do you want to say anything?
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes. I mean it somewhat depends on what the revenue curve looks like out in time. Obviously, we're guiding for nice growth again in December. Ganesh has made comments about March being a growth quarter for us. So it's going to take us some time to catch up, Will.
William Stein: Okay. And then I want to linger on the same topic that so many other people have hit on but I want to ask it sort of a different way. I understand the PSP is very high-quality backlog. You're not seeing many cancellation requests. Even if you took all the cancels, you'd still have this good guidance and the comments on March. What it doesn't so much address is what might happen in a couple of quarters if more customers, either doing PSP or otherwise, come in and request a cancel or pushout. The question really is that this is one thing that has changed in -- maybe not the model but in the way the company operates. Steve, in fact, you talk a lot about how you’d never use distribution as sort of a mechanism to, let’s say, stuff -- let’s call it stuffing the channel for a moment. When you have to make a decision as to whether you force the customer to move up to an NCNR, that is remarkably similar to stuffing the channel in terms of at least the economic impact on your business. And I’m wondering how you’re going to take that decision if you wind up in a position where more customers come to you to cancel, whether it’s PSP or regular backlog, how you make this decision. On the one hand, I want to make them live up to their commitments because you highlighted all those reasons. On the other hand, if you do that, you know you’re damaging future demand and pushing out a painful situation. How do you plan on managing that, balancing those two dynamics?
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, this is not the first time we've had to deal with noncancelable backlog. It has been a part of our business for basically ever, right? It's just that the percentage of that has grown. We work with customers on what their requirements are but you can't have an asymmetric agreement where heads, they win; and tails, we lose, right? You got to make sure that there are commitments. This is why if you make sure that there is an understanding that there is a responsibility with placing that backlog, they will moderate the backlog they place on us. If they have no responsibility, then there is no reason why they wouldn't just give us much, much higher backlog than where they're at. So we think, again, going back to the quality of the backlog, it comes because it has responsibility that goes with it. Outside of that situation by situation with the customer, we're in this to be in business. But we're not in this to say it's all risk-free or all the risk is on our side in what we go with it. And by the way, by and large, that’s how customers have expected this thing as well. They’re not pushing on us to say, “Hey, I didn’t mean that it should be PSP and I now want something else different from what we had agreed to. So I don’t see that as big of an issue. And by the way, if we didn’t have PSP, the situation we have is far, far higher backlog and far bigger of a fall from that high backlog we have.
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes. I think one other thing I'd like to point out, Will, because you're talking several quarters out in time beyond March, right? A customer that's on PSP and has 12 months of backlog with us, every week or every month that goes by, they make a decision in terms of what the next backlog that they're going to put on us out in time. They could put 0 backlog. They could put 50%. They could put 120% of what it was the month before. And so these fears of rising interest rates and recession, this is not new when we woke up today. This has been happening now for several months. And I think customers gradually adjust that over time. But as Ganesh has said, PSP is still a large percentage of our backlog. We still have tons of unsupported. And it’s been a program that I believe has worked very well, not only for the customer but for Microchip.
Stephen Sanghi: I think the gist of your question is that lots and lots of PSP customers want to cancel and we're just now letting them do it. And that is not the case. There is a negligible amount. I mean, at any point in time, you have customers that want to move small things around. The PSP backlog is not going to see the behavior that you're talking about. We're not inundated with PSP customers wanting to cancel the backlog and we're not canceling it. And that's not happening next quarter. It's not happening quarter after. I think that's the issue. That's your assumption that it would happen. We don’t think we will face that because the PSP backlog is very high quality and customers can easily start to adjust it by taking the foot off the gas pedal every month when they place the order 12 months out.
Ganesh Moorthy: Let me give me one more piece of data. We're making a big deal of cancellations. If you aggregate all the cancellation requests we have, it's 4.5% of our total backlog and that includes PSP, non-PSP and it will be dominated by non-PSP. It is a negligible part of the business, guys.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Chris Danely of Citigroup.
Chris Danely: So I think someone asked you earlier about lead times, how they gone up or gone down or how much -- and you said you really couldn't define that. You also said you still have some, I guess, quite a bit of business that's constrained or products that are constrained. Is there any, like, I guess, metrics that you could give us that would talk about your percentage of products or percentage of business that is constrained or in shortage now versus 3 months ago and what you expect to be 3 months from now, just so we could, I guess, track the progress of that?
Ganesh Moorthy: The best metric probably is what is the unsupported backlog exiting quarters. And I'm going to tell you, it's high. It's probably not healthy to be there and we will work to improve that. And it is to improve the customer service and the customer experience with it. But we have still substantial constraints that we're working through and it will take us many, many quarters to work through them.
Stephen Sanghi: I don't know if Ganesh said that earlier but our unsupported backlog leaving September quarter was another all-time high. So during the quarter, customer wanted more parts to be shipped in the September quarter that we couldn't ship and the unsupported grew over the June quarter to another record. So that doesn't mean in any way that customers are feeling that the lead times are coming in. I mean we are broadly constrained almost everywhere. I mean we've got daily escalation calls from multiple customers every day. So it hasn't even reached the peak. The unsupported hasn't even reached the peak and started dropping. It is still growing.
Chris Danely: Yes. That’s what I was getting at. That’s what it felt like. And then for my follow-up, so Steve, you’ve been through even more cycles than I have. If this continues, where the competitors keep taking numbers down and the recession gets worse and worse and your business gets better and better or gets through it, I mean do you think it’s possible for you guys to make it through a global recession and a downturn unscathed or relatively unscathed? And did you see anything during this quarter other than the unsupported backlog that made you feel any better or any worse about Microchip’s ability to do that?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, you have to define what unscaled meant. As Ganesh talked about it in his remarks that we're not seeing anything today but we see the macro weakening and what all the other companies are saying. And what we are seeing is if macro ever catches up to us, then we have step in place to create a soft lending. When you say unscaled, we're not saying we're going to keep growing 22% per year forever like we have been. But we will soft land the plane because of all the attributes Ganesh went over.
Operator: And then next, we'll hear from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: I was hoping you can talk a little bit about what you're seeing from a pricing perspective across your microcontroller and analog businesses. Your September quarter revenue was up 25% plus year-over-year. How much of that was pricing? And then, Steve, when you were at our -- at our conference 1.5 months ago, you had hinted that pricing should be a tailwind in the early part of ‘23 as well given some of the conversations that you were having with your foundry suppliers. I’m curious if anything has changed since then. And then I have a quick follow-up.
Ganesh Moorthy: So pricing is stable. There are no price adjustments that are being made that are affecting where the quarterly results are. We did make an adjustment at the beginning of this year or the early part of this year and that's where it's at. I don't think we have any price adjustment plans into 2023 that are in the offering. And so pricing is really not a factor today. in terms of what we're executing, where we are going in terms of our new designs and where we are in terms of our business.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. And then as my follow-up, I guess this is a hypothetical but given the visibility you have and given everything that you’ve said so far in the call, if your business in calendar ‘23 is, say, up 5% or flat or somewhere in that range and most of your peers are down 10%, would it be fair to say that in a recovery phase in 2024, you undergrow your peers or you perhaps don’t participate in that recovery? Or are you guys gaining permanent structural share across the analog and * MCU businesses?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's a hypothetical. We don't know what '24 is but we believe we are gaining share. We are executing the total system solutions strategy we have. We are focused on the fastest-growing markets and we are seeing substantial wins that are creating the tailwinds for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Channel or just the inventories, still 40% below pre-pandemic levels. Your own inventories are kind of at the low end of your target range. So obviously, clear signs that demand remains strong. Given your capacity expansion plans, looking at your demand profile and backlog, do you guys anticipate increasing inventories with your customers and moving towards the midpoint of your range on your own inventories over the next, call it, 2 to 3 quarters?
James Eric Bjornholt: So, we actually grew quite a bit of inventory on our balance sheet in the September quarter and you'll see just below our guidance table in our press release, we're expecting that to grow again this quarter. And in my prepared remarks, I kind of went through some of the reasons why that is happening is we're positioning the company for future growth. In terms of distribution, distribution inventory stayed flat quarter-on-quarter at 19 days. And we think at some point in time, there will be some level of restocking in the distribution channel. That's going to vary by distributor and what -- how they manage the business. But in the meantime, with their inventory being relatively low, we feel that we need to have more inventory on our balance sheet to support the end customer needs. And so that's what we're doing. But really, we are now within our target range of inventory days that we provided to the Street back in our November Analyst Day. So, we're managing it appropriately in a challenged supply environment, I would call it.
Harlan Sur: Yes. And I know it’s always somewhat complex to is to end market demand trends because you’ve got such a broad portfolio of products. You’re serving many different end markets. However, there is one segment where products are more easily tracked because they are very specific to that end market that’s our rad-hard kind of high roll products that’s your aerospace and defense business. I believe it’s about 13% to 14% of your revenues much higher mix versus your peers. It seems like activity around commercial space programs, new satellite constellations, defense spending all look strong for not just next year but the next several years. You guys are number one in space, strong term defense. Like help us understand the visibility in A&D, growth trends and sustainability of this segment into a potentially weaker macroeconomic backdrop next year.
Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So aerospace and defense, I think, is about 9%, 10% of our revenue. It is performing extremely well for many reasons. And you missed commercial aviation. Commercial aviation is going through a strong resurgence. And so all 3 elements space, defense and commercial aviation are all doing strongly in the current environment. And they are generally less influenced by shorter-term macroeconomic conditions.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Matt Ramsay of Cowen.
Matt Ramsay: I think Toshi took my earlier question on ASP assumptions, so I'll just ask one. It's around the consideration of investing in the 300-millimeter fab. I guess there's 2 parts to the question. Ganesh, as you consider that, what would be just, I don’t know, ballpark off the top of your head, focus of which process nodes mix in a facility like that if you consider it. And then second, is this something that you guys felt you needed to do but didn’t really feel like you could fund all of it until the CHIPS Act got passed and now that’s a reaction to potential funding from governments? Or was this a decision that you were probably going to need to make anyway.
Ganesh Moorthy: So firstly, on process technologies, those are still being worked. But largely, we use our 300-millimeter foundries today on process technologies that are 90-nanometer and smaller in size. And the workhorse technologies for trailing edge tend to be at 40, 65, 90 in that general neighborhood. But those -- we wouldn't limit ourselves just to that. Again, I want you to think of this as this is a 20-year, 25-year look at what we would do with the 300-millimeter fab. The reasoning for it is we have -- as our business has grown, the portion of our business that we do with 300-millimeter has also grown. And the investment in the trailing edge part of 300-millimeter technologies has not been there with many of our foundries at the level that we have wanted. And -- but it takes a certain scale to get there. And if you had a full boat fab that you needed to build, the way in which the breakeven points and the absorption points come about are different from when there is a fab that can be built with government funding and the investment tax credits and whatever local things come in. So clearly, that has changed the equation as to when does it make sense financially. But that's not the only reason why. We think trailing-edge 300-millimeter technology is going to have constraints for a long time to come and a portion of that being within Microchip would allow us to better serve those markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore: If you look at your operating margins now, you’re obviously much higher than you’ve been in prior cycles. It seems like a lot of that is secular. But like do you -- when you contemplate these soft landing scenarios, do you expect your margins to sort of see the type of decline you’ve seen historically? Could we go back to prior troughs? Just how do -- I know some of your competitors have talked about a target margin on kind of a trough revenue level. Like how should we think about primarily gross margin leverage in a sort of weaker environment?
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, I'll give you a quick answer and then Eric might want to elaborate more on it. Again, the best way to look at it is how have we performed over the last 15 years through the cycles. And you will see that on those metrics, the frozen operating margin from peak to trough across the cycle, about 200 basis points is the decline in that range, plus or minus 200, 300 basis points. And that's the way in which we manage the business. It's built into our DNA. It's built into our systems and processes. It's built into the soft landing that I described a quarter ago. Eric, do you want to add more to it?
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes. I mean, obviously, we've continued to integrate acquisitions. We've got a different product mix than we've had historically. We feel really comfortable with the margin targets that we've set out for the Street which we are above today, as you mentioned, on the operating margin side. Because the business has grown so well, we've got quite a bit of cushion. I would call it on our OpEx today with the level of bonuses that we're playing, variable comp that will allow us to adjust if need be, if the macro catches up with us at some point in time. So -- and we want to build inventory in our own factories. We think the distributors will rebuild inventory. And so we don’t want to give a specific number. But again, the range that we’ve provided on a long-term basis, we think that we can operate within that. And obviously, we’re operating above it today.
Ganesh Moorthy: And the mix of the business we have has end markets that are far more durable in terms of how they perform and what gross margin these products and solutions we bring are able to command. And it's not just silicon. It's silicon, it's software, it's systems, it's services. These are very, very sticky applications and markets that are not prone to perhaps what a pure consumer or mobile phone type of market may have.
Operator: Tore Svanberg of Stifel.
Tore Svanberg: Congrats on all the record metrics. I have a sort of a different angle on the pricing question and it’s kind of more related to ASPs. So if you look at the 25.7% growth year-over-year that you are reporting this quarter, how much of that is coming from higher ASPs, meaning selling more value in the form of your total system type solutions?
Ganesh Moorthy: There's not an easy way to break that up. Clearly, with constrained capacity, we will direct them and have been directing it to the highest-value products that we're producing. We're shipping more units. So there's a lot of the growth that's coming from capacity and additions that we have made in it. But I certainly don't have a good way to parse out what comes from mix and pricing versus what comes from units alone.
Tore Svanberg: That’s fair. And then I had a question on the inventory, whether it’s internal or channel. So obviously, the channel, it sounds like you’re going to sort of keep that a little bit constrained going forward. But is there maybe a secular trend here where basically, maybe the right number is actually around 20 days of channel inventory and then your own inventories could maybe even exceed the high end of the range which is 1-50 [ph].
Ganesh Moorthy: No. We don't dictate what channel inventory needs to be. The channel decides what inventory do they need. In some cases, we may be constrained in shipping it to them and they may not be able to get what they want to but channel has a history of what does it take to support the mix of product, the customer expectations that are there. And we are at the low end of what they have historically done and whether they're going to be at 19 or 20 or 25 or 30 is really a decision they're going to make. We don't tell them what to do in terms of inventory.
James Eric Bjornholt: Ultimately, they need to stock the level of inventory appropriate to support their customers and they’ll need to find the right level of that as supply becomes less constrained than it is today. We have a lot of unsupported backlog to our distributors today that we need to catch up on.
Stephen Sanghi: Well, for the last year, it doesn't really matter what distributor wanted. We just don't have the product to start them, so there has not been a choice. And we don't think there's a choice for -- well into 2023. But someday, when we have parts available to start distribution, at that point in time, it will matter what they want to do. Right now, it doesn't at.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. I guess my point was more maybe you have a better read on sell-through than they do, so that’s fair.
Operator: Next one from Raji Gill of Needham & Company.
Raji Gill: Congratulations on good results in this very uncertain environment. Just one question on gross margins. They continue to be at kind of record levels. I’m wondering kind of what are the -- have been the drivers of the margin so far? And how do we think about those drivers going through into next year?
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes. Well, I think the biggest drivers are going to be factory utilization, right? I mean we have more backlog than we know what to do with at this point in time. And so the factories are running harder than they've ever been before, every piece of equipment that we have to produce as much product as we can. And so with that, our planning and operations team are able to schedule things and batch runs and try to produce as much product as they can. So that’s a big thing. And then I think the other thing that we talked about in the response to some of the earlier questions is just our product mix and how that’s changed over time has continued to enhance the gross margin.
Operator: Next, we here from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh: Just a quick question here. As you look at -- you talked about your own inventory and the China inventory. I was just wondering if you could give us some color on what the inventories look like. Because I think you’re starting to see some of the OEMs like Stellantis and BMW this morning talk about worries about caution about a slowing down of sales with macro and rates, et cetera? And then I have a follow-up.
Ganesh Moorthy: So OEMs don't tell us what inventory they carry, right? Now what we can gauge is how are they interacting with us on how they see business, how they're -- how many escalation issues are we still working? And we don't see an abatement in terms of what they're trying to do. And OEMs also have not only a requirement to sell to their demand. They're also trying to replenish their dealers and what the dealers inventory needs to be trying to replenish what the rental car inventory needs to be out there. So demand is still running strong and we don't see for our products an inventory issue that they're bringing to us to go solve. If anything, we're working more shortages and constraints for it with them.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And on the last quick question on the pricing side. I know you talked about many different products but obviously, a lot of the microcontrollers are pretty long-life products there. So just wondering if you took a step back and looked at 2021 or ‘22 as you exit ‘22 here for some of the long-life products that you guys have, how has that pricing change trended over the last 2 years?
Ganesh Moorthy: So pricing over the history of Microchip is a strategic exercise for a sole-sourced product that is proprietary from us. The only time when we have made a pricing adjustment that's been broad-based, is over the last year to 1.5 years, when we had cost increases with a view towards covering the cost increases that we were subject to in the way we passed on margin up for that. So outside of that, pricing is not something we try to take advantage of when there are constraints nor is pricing something that we give up on when there is extra supply.
Operator: And it appears to have further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters for any additional or closing comments.
Ganesh Moorthy: Great. I want to thank everybody for hanging in there and despite some of the technical challenges. We appreciate the questions and we look forward to seeing many of you and talking to many of you in the phone calls and conferences we have coming up. So thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2022-08-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Microchip's First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Financial Results. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.  At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Eric Bjornholt, our CFO. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our first quarter financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and this conference call, on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses part of the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. Net sales in the June quarter were $1.964 billion, which was up 6.5% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 67.1%, operating expenses were at 21.5% and operating income was a record 45.6%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $767.2 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.37 and $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range. On a GAAP basis in the June quarter, gross margins were a record at 66.7%. Total operating expenses were $608.6 million and included acquisition and tangible amortization of $167.6 million, special income of $16.9 million; $1.7 million of acquisition related and other costs and share-based compensation of $33.5 million. GAAP net income was a record $507.2 million, resulting in $0.90 per diluted share and was adversely impacted by a $6.2 million loss on debt settlement associated with our convertible debt refinancing activities and positively impacted by a $22 million litigation accrual adjustment. Our June quarter, GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably the tax benefits recorded as a result of the loss on the debt settlement. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 9.4% in the June quarter and was in line with our guidance. The June quarter tax rate was up approximately 450 basis points from the rates in fiscal year 2022. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal 2023 to be between 8.5% and 10.5% exclusive with a transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. A reminder of what we communicated last quarter, our fiscal 2023 cash tax rate is higher than our fiscal 2022 tax rate for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2022 was $911.8 million. We had 127 days of inventory at the end of the June quarter, which was up two days from the prior quarterâs level. A major part of the increase in days of inventory was driven by the 50 basis point sequential increase in gross margin. Our levels of raw materials and work in progress increased in the quarter, which helps position us for the increased production we are expecting from our internal factories and helps buffer to a degree, some against unexpected shortages or changes in material lead times. The caring cost of our inventory has been and will be increasing due to rising input costs from our supply chain, as well as several last time buys, we are forced to make because of capacity restructuring actions being taken by our suppliers. We are continuing to ramp capacity in our internal and external factories, so we can ship more products to support customer requirements. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter was at 19 days, which was up two days from the prior quarterâs level. In the June quarter, we repurchased $34.6 million of principal value of our 2027 and 2037 convertible subordinated notes for cash. And we also paid cash for the value of these bonds above the principal amount. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the amount of a convertible debt repurchases. And we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by reducing share count dilution to the extent, our stock price appreciates over time. The principal amount of convertible debt on our balance sheet at June 30 was $803.5 million. This includes $665.5 million of convertible bonds maturing in November of 2024 with a cap call option in place that offsets any potential dilution from these convertibles up to a stock price of $116.34. At the beginning of calendar year 2020, Microchip had $4.481 billion of convertible bonds outstanding. So today, our overall capital structure is in a much better long-term position. Our cash flow from operating activities was $840.4 million in the June quarter. Our free cash flow was $718.5 million and 36.6% of net sales. As of June 30, our consolidated cash in total investment position was $379.1 million. We paid down $233.6 million of total debt in the June quarter. And our net debt was reduced by $293.3 million. Over the last 16 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $5.2 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during the earlier years of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business, as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was a record at $986.7 million and 50.2% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $3.521 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.05 at June 30, 2022, down from 2.32 at March 31, 2022, and down from 3.34 at June 30, 2021. Capital expenditures were $121.9 million in the June quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 is between $500 million and $550 million as we continue to take actions to support the growth of our business and the ramp of our manufacturing operations. We continue to prudently add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected long-term growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $71.7 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter results continue to be strong across the Board, setting several records in the process. Revenue grew 6.5% sequentially and 25.1% on a year-over-year basis to achieve another all-time record at $1.96 billion. This was a seventh consecutive quarter where we achieved a record revenue mark. During the quarter, we worked through several COVID-related operational challenges, including, but not limited to, the shutdowns in Shanghai, which affected our customers and our supply chain partners. Non-GAAP gross margin was another record of 67.1%, up 50 basis points from the March quarter and up 230 basis points from the year ago quarter, benefiting from improved operational efficiencies as well as product mix changes. Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record of 45.6%, up 90 basis points from the March quarter and up 390 basis points from the year ago quarter, achieving the high end of our guidance. Due to our rapid increase in revenue, operating expenses at 21.5% or 100 basis points below the low end of our long-term model range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Our long-term operating expense model will continue to guide our investment actions to drive the long-term growth and profitability of our business. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS was a record $1.37 per share, up 38.4% from the year ago quarter and just above the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA at 50.2% of revenue and free cash flow at 36.6% of revenue were both very strong in the June quarter, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation capabilities of our business. Net debt declined by $293.3 million, driving our net leverage ratio down to 2.05 exiting the June quarter as we continue to aggressively drive down our net leverage. Recalling that our net leverage was almost 5x at the end of the 2018 June quarter right after the Microsemi acquisition. It is satisfying to see how far we have come in the full year since to bring down our net leverage so significantly. During the June quarter, we returned $348.2 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, representing 55% of the prior quarterâs free cash flow. I would like to take this opportunity to profusely thank all of our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding results and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team for their concerted effort and never give up attitude to deliver results for our customers despite a historic and persistent imbalance between supply and demand. Taking a look at our revenue from product line perspective, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up 1.6% as compared to the March quarter and set another all-time record. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter microcontroller revenue was up 17.8%. Microcontrollers represented 54.1% of our revenue in the June quarter. Our analog revenue sequentially increased 12.5% in the June quarter, setting another record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter analog revenue was up a strong 34.2%, and analog represented 29.5% of our revenue in the June quarter. The difference in growth rate in the June quarter between microcontrollers and analog is in part based on quarter-to-quarter differences as we have seen in the past and in part because we are competitively less constrained on analog products, which are predominantly produced through internal factories. Although, we no longer break them out, it was notable that in the June quarter, our FPGA revenue as well as our technology licensing royalty revenue were both up strongly and achieved new records. Taking a look at our revenue from a geographic and end market perspective. Americas was up 33% over the prior year quarter. Europe was up 28.4% over the prior year quarter. Asia was up 20.7% over the prior year quarter. Our major end markets remain strong and were supply constrained. Business conditions continue to be strong as viewed through our internal indicators, we expect to remain supply constrained through the rest of 2022 and into 2023. Demand continued to be insatiable despite the capacity increases we have implemented so far. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which represents backlog customers want to ship to them in the June quarter, but which we could not deliver in the June quarter climbed again. We exited the June quarter with our highest unsupported backlog ever, with unsupported backlog coming in well above the actual revenue we achieve. We are cognizant of the weakening macro conditions resulting from rising inflation and the actions being taken by central banks and response. Weâre also aware that there is some inventory build at our customers as can be seen in their balance sheet, some of which we believe is due to strategic buffer inventory builds and some of which is due to incomplete kits or the infamous golden screw effect. While we have seen sporadic requests to push our backlog, these requests are a small fraction of the very large unsupported backlog we have over multiple quarters and hence, have not had a material impact on our business. At the same time, the level of expedites and customer escalations weâre experiencing has not abated, indicating that demand and supply remain imbalanced from many customer situations. In order to best utilize the available supply and reduced customer inventory builds, we continue to thoughtfully reallocate future supply from customers who self-identify inventory positions to customers in distress with imminent line style situations. Given the crosscurrents of strong internal business indicators and some uncertainty in the macro environment, we have modeled a range of potential scenarios and are monitoring our leading indicators, which should enable us to take deliberate actions swiftly and early when appropriate. Our goal is to deliver a soft landing for our business if or when the softer macro environment catches up with it. And so hereâs how weâre thinking about it. We continue to have strong PSP backlog, which is non-cancelable for at least 12 months, which comprises well over 50% of our total backlog. In addition, over the last six months, we have entered into multi-year long-term supply agreements with a number of large customers, in effect, giving them reserved capacity in exchange for guaranteed purchases typically over five years. We have a significant demand cushion with unsupported backlog that is much greater than 100% of supported backlog and which can readily absorb any push outs and cancellations. Distribution inventory at 19 days is low when compared to what the channel has historically required to serve customers effectively. Any business weakness will give us the opportunity to replenish depleted channel inventory and position our channel partners to respond to business growth as well as better serve customers. Our internal die bank and finished goods inventory has been substantially depleted as demand outstripped supply for the last seven quarters. Any business weakness will enable us to replenish this inventory to better position us to support our customers. We continue â we expect continued above-average secular growth trends, resulting from our focus on total system solutions and megatrends. In addition, our end market exposure is concentrated in the industrial, aerospace and defense, automotive, data center and communications infrastructure markets, all of which have demonstrated much higher durability in prior cycles. With any business weakness, we expect our capital intensity will shift to the lower end or even below the low end of our CapEx guidance of 3% to 6% of revenue, thatâs liberating free cash flow. And finally, as youâve seen in prior cycles, we expect our variable compensation programs to buffer our operating expenses and protect our operating model. If you study Microchip speak to trust performance through the business cycles over the last 15 years, you will observe our robust and consistent cash generation, gross margin and operating margin results. The investor presentation posted on our IR website today provides details about our performance through the business cycles. If or when there is a macro slowdown that impacts our business, we expect our cash generation, gross margin and operating margin to once again demonstrate consistency and resiliency. This will help us to continue to execute our long-term Microchip 3.0 growth strategy and insulated from whatever short-term market challenges they may be. We continue to expect constraints in our internal and external factories and the related manufacturing supply chains, we are ramping our internal factories and working closely with our supply chain partners to secure additional capacity wherever possible. We expect our capital spending in fiscal year 2023 to be modestly above the 3% to 6% of revenue range we have shared with you as we respond to growth opportunities in our business. We believe our calibrated increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, serve our customers better, increase our market share, improve our gross margin and give us more control over our destiny, especially for specialized trailing edge technologies. Weâre also pleased to see the CHIPS and Science Act approved by Congress with bipartisan support and expect the President will sign it into law imminently. This bill is good for the semiconductor industry and for America as it enables critical investments, which will even the global playing field for U.S. companies while being strategically important for our economic and national security. We expect to be eligible to benefit from the grants under this legislation, as well as the investment tax credit provisions of the bill as we do our part to invest in ensuring U.S. economic and national security. Now letâs get into the guidance for the September quarter. Our backlog for the September quarter is strong, and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales the September quarter to be up between 3% and 7% sequentially, and we expect sequential revenue growth again in the December quarter. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the September quarter would be a strong 25%. For the September quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 67.3% and 67.7% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 21.3% and 21.7% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 45.6% and 46.4% of sales, and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.42 per share and $1.46 per share. At the midpoint of our EPS guidance, our year-over-year growth for the September quarter would be a strong 34.6%. Finally, as you can see from our June quarter results and September quarter guidance, every element of our Microchip 3.0 strategy is firing on all cylinders as we continue to build and improve what we believe is one of the most diversified, defensible, high growth, high margin, high cash generating businesses in the semiconductor industry. To summarize the essential elements of Microchip 3.0, they are organic growth â organic revenue growth rate of 10% to 15% in the fiscal year 2022 to 2026 time frame by focusing on total system solutions in our six key market megatrends. Long-term non-GAAP operating margin target of 44% to 46% and free cash flow target of 38%, consistently increasing capital return to shareholders as net leverage drops such that 100% of free cash flow is returned to shareholders after net leverage drops to 1.5x. CapEx investment of 3% to 6% of revenue and inventory investment of 130 to 150 days over business cycles, and a strong company foundation that is built on culture and sustainability. Now let me pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip, that have delivered another exceptional quarter while making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non-GAAP EPS and record adjusted EBITDA. And all of that in a very challenging supply environment. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 9.1% from last quarter to $0.301 per share. This is an increase of 37.8% from the year ago quarter. During the last quarter, we purchased $195.2 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $153 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $348.2 million. This amount was 55% of our actual free cash flow of $633.1 million during the March 2022 quarter. Our paydown of debt as well as record adjusted EBITDA drove down our net leverage at the end of June 2022 quarter to 2.05 from 2.32 at the end of March quarter. Ever since we achieved investment-grade rating for our debt in November of 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $1.04 billion to shareholders through June 30, 2022, by a combination of dividends and share buybacks. In the September quarter, we will use the June quarterâs actual free cash flow of $718.5 million and plan to return 57.5% or $413.1 million of that amount to our shareholders. Out of this $413.1 million, the dividend is expected to be approximately $166.5 million and the stock buyback is expected to be approximately $246.6 million. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: Thank you sir.  We will take the first question from Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Gary Mobley: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on some solid results. Letâs just start out with the inevitability of the CHIPS Act being passed. I know you guys have a relatively high U.S. oriented manufacturing footprint employee base and not to mention a lot of U.S.-centric military business. And so Iâm wondering if maybe you can give us a little more color in how the CHIPS Act may benefit you from a CapEx subsidization perspective or from an R&D tax credit perspective, anything you can add there?
Ganesh Moorthy: So there are various components of the CHIPS Act and the rules of engagement of how they will be handed out are going to be different. So the most obvious one is the investment tax credit. And for any capital expenses and factories that are built, et cetera, that is the first thing that we think will take effect, and itâs probably the end of the year or the beginning of next year before that comes into effect, and thatâs a 25% investment tax credit. There are then grants that are for both manufacturing and for R&D. And we have opportunities on both of those with the expansion plans that we have and some of the R&D programs that we are pursuing. But honestly, itâs too early because those are not quite clear yet in terms of how the requirements will be in that. We have, of course, been engaged with both Department of Commerce and Department of Defense for many months, with to give them an understanding of what the aligned interests are between what we are planning to do, are interested in doing and what the government sees as natural security imperatives. And so we expect that as that rolls out, weâll have more to share, but not at this point in time.
Gary Mobley: Thank you, Ganesh. Appreciated.
Operator: We will take the next question from Raji Gil, Needham & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Raji Gil: Yes, thank you and congrats, again on managing through this very on a very volatile period of time with great results. Just a question on your unsupported backlog. You mentioned it climbed again, itâs well above the actual revenue that you achieved. And you mentioned as part of your kind of scenario analysis that you can absorb any potential order push-outs or order cancelations. Wondering if you could maybe elaborate further and maybe help us understand if there is a significant decline in demand in some of these end markets. How much do you think youâll be able to kind of absorb? And you mentioned there are some indications of order volatility. Iâm wondering if you could maybe describe that as well? And where are you seeing it? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: So on your last question, the order volatility we see is sporadic. Itâs very small, and it is well, well below the unsupported orders that we have, and they are easily substitutable with other orders we have. And we have indicated that the unsupported is in excess of what we are shipping. So, you can see the backlog would have to be cut by more than half just to get to where weâre at. And thatâs a far, far cry from where todayâs activity is taking place.
Raji Gil: Thank you.
Operator: We will take the next question from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
John Buchalter: Hey guys, this is John Buchalter on behalf of Matt. Thanks for taking my questions. And congrats on the solid results. The revenue and gross margins speak for themselves. But I was wondering, are there any metrics you can provide to help us understand how much of the upside was driven by pricing versus units as we try to square away how much your capacity investments on the CapEx line are flowing through to the model already, and whatâs still on the come? Thanks guys.
Ganesh Moorthy: So itâs not an easy way for us to break out pricing versus the increased number of units. Obviously, we have a component of both that go into it. On the units, we have a component, which is what are we doing from our own factories and then we have components of what are we trying to do and get from our partners. And what is coming from our factories, we at least have plans and things that we can measure what comes from our partners we can have upside sometimes that are unexpected that help us. So it is very clear, weâre shipping more parts. And there is a component of price that is included â the price increases we have made are to offset cost increases that we have experienced. And so the primary driver for us is to grow by growing units, not by growing price. Okay. We should move to the next question.
Operator: The next question is from William Stein from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taken my question. With regard to the strength of the backlog and the increase in capacity that youâre expecting? It sounds like youâre expecting that to continue over the next few quarters. Would you be willing to provide us perhaps not guidance, but some way to think about revenue growth in subsequent quarters? Could we think about at least, for example, into the December quarter having relative â having, let's say a relatively strong feeling that that will be an up quarter?
Ganesh Moorthy: So we don't provide guidance obviously for subsequent quarters, but I did in my prepared remarks, say we will grow in the December quarter. And if you look at historically, December is a declining quarter from any measure of historical seasonality. And so we are quite confident we will grow into the December quarter. Does that answer your question Will?
Operator: Heâs not on the line right now.
Ganesh Moorthy: All right, go ahead.
Operator:  In the meantime we will take the next questionnaire from Chris Danely from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Chris Danely: I guess just a question on capacity and the shortages. So are you seeing any improvement in the shortage or capacity situation, you talk about trying to squeeze a little bit more both internally and externally has your projected capacity gone up a little bit over the last few months as you've been able to maybe hunt around and find a few more parts out there and maybe just give us a little more color on that supply and demand balance situation?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yeah. So for our internal factories, we have been investing in CapEx for many quarters. We made progress in our backend factories first because it was a shorter cycle time and easier to bring on. We have been making progress on our front-end factories and still have many quarters of capacity that we think we can bring on as we are able to get equipment. And some of the equipment that we have needed has been delayed as being able to hire people. And it has been harder in some prior quarters, but we're getting better in terms of being able to fill our positions in the factories, et cetera. So clearly internal capacity is growing and helping us support some of the backlog that we're unable to support at this point in time. We have had incrementally more constructive capacity improvements from our external partners, although it is still very small in the grand scheme of what we need in terms of that. And we are hopeful that some of perhaps the weaknesses that may be out there in other segments will in fact help free up some of the capacity we need, although there's not an exact mix between where things are getting freed up and where things are that we require, but I think incrementally it will be constructive and positive for us.
Chris Danely: Got it. Okay. Thanks Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: The next question from Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Yep. Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong execution. Your near to midterm business continues strong, right? You've talked many times about the unsupported backlog being strong, but I think the market concern continues to be for a broader slow down next year, not so much for this year, just given the mix of your business, maybe as a reflection of your customer's view on next year, your â maybe it's worthwhile to look at your PSP customers, because they're giving you 12 months order visibility, but they have to continue to keep that 12 month PSP funnel going, right? So they're continuing to add orders to the back-end of their PSP funnel every single month. So given that they're booking well into next year, combined with the concerns on a macro slowdown, have you guys seen a deceleration or decline in the PSP sort of order, true-ups on a sequential basis as sort of a reflection on customer demand concerns next year?
Ganesh Moorthy: Nothing perceptively changing. If you look at PSP as a percentage of our total backlog, it's pretty rock steady within about one percentage point through pretty much the last 13, 14 weeks of time. So it's certainly a good indicator. We pay attention to and we are watching where that is going. I think the strength of our business also is driven by the end markets we're exposed to. And what is out there today where you see many of the concerns and people who are seeing weakness, it's predominantly in consumer driven segments. And so whether that is consumer PCs, consumer mobile phone, consumer electronics, et cetera. And we have no consumer PC exposure. We do have enterprise PC exposure. It's very strong. We have almost no phone exposure. Our consumer appliances are â we don't have consumer electronics so to speak, we do have home appliances and they could be a part of it, but it's such a small piece of our overall thing. So our end market exposure, we're very fortunate to have very durable markets and I think Eric wants to add a comment to it as well.
Eric Bjornholt: Yeah, I mean, so on PSP specifically, the dollars amount of PSP backlog that we had leaving June was higher than it was at the end of March. So, I mean the program is still quite effective. Customers are participating in it and adding orders out in time.
Harlan Sur: Well, thank you for the insights.
Operator: We'll take the next question from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. And congratulations on the record quarter. You've talked about being able to manage a bit of a soft landing in case macro continues to deteriorate, obviously you've got the PSP program. Would you talk about some of the other levers that you have, and maybe put them into perspective of your financial, especially gross margin and operating margin, because as you know you have a very, very strong variable cost structure, so any more color you could add would be great?
Ganesh Moorthy: So I had outlined multiple points that help us with a soft landing. So you mentioned PSP, which is clearly one part of the demand cycle. I think we have in the last six months also been adding to that with some long-term supply agreements, which bolster the demand side of the equation, even farther than just what PSP did. We've talked about how large unsupported is and how that continues to provide a buffer against any ups and downs that may be there in the shorter-term. We will, with any slowing down that we might see use that as an opportunity to rebuild what is a supply chain running on fumes, right? We have our internal die banks and finished goods inventories that have been substantially depleted. While you see some of our days of inventory perhaps moving a little bit up, a lot of that has come from the change in gross margin and really raw materials and end-of-life product that we're buying. On an ongoing basis, to be healthy, we need to be able to run with more inventory, both with our channel partners and our internal factories. All of that will continue to provide absorption and gross margin protection in whatever happens in the cycle. And then we've talked about our capital intensity coming down, coming below the range, again, from a cash preservation standpoint, cash generation standpoint, that will help. And then finally, on the OpEx side, we've always had a large variable compensation element that gives us a large buffer for how we can have expenses come in or out during the different cycles. And I think those are all the elements that give us the comfort on a soft landing, which is to ensure that what we're able to do in terms of our gross margin, our operating margin, our cash generation. All remain strong through whatever that soft landing requirement is.
Tore Svanberg: All good perspective. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Rolland from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Chris Rolland: Hi guys. Thanks for the question. You guys either Ganesh or Steve, you guys have talked about analog capacity additions for the industry coming in 2023 and beyond. We're now starting to hear about potentially equipment push outs and stuff like that. And maybe a little pumping of the brakes, I don't know if that's the opinion that you guys may have as well. But would love to see kind of longer term, how you view capacity for the analog industry overall? And would it have any sort of effect on your business? Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: Let me take a quick shot and then maybe Steve can answer to it. So I don't want to speak for what the overall industry is doing because different people have different plans and thoughts and what they're doing. I think what we can see is that those technology nodes that are very specialized and analog tends to be that, that tend to be from the trailing edge of the technology nodes that are out there, are underinvested. And yet are critically important in being able to drive the growth for even the leading-edge technology, so that you have more complete solutions. So in that sense, we believe that, that whole end of the market, that requires analog solutions, mixed signal solutions, et cetera, is getting insufficient capital attention, and we are taking some actions for it. I don't know what everybody else is doing, but we think it is going to be constrained for quite a while to come. Steve, do you want to add more?
Steve Sanghi: Certainly, much more of our analog business comes from internal production than the microcontrollers do. And we earlier described â Ganesh described in his prepared comments about the growth of the microcontroller business versus the growth of the analog business. We are doing much better in capacity increase inside than we are doing it outside of our partners. And with microcontrollers having a large component of production outside and analog having large production inside, we have been able to make more capacity available for analog, hence, stronger near-term growth that we have seen. The inside capacity on trailing edge technologies where analog runs, it also is a bit easier to add then to really get capacity outside. You talked about equipment push outs. I mean some of the equipment push outs happened in the last 12 to 18 months. And a lot of the equipment is here now after a push out, something that was supposed to come in September arrived in January, February, but it is in production now, and it's contributing to the growth, and we believe will continue to contribute to the growth in the December quarter, as Ganesh mentioned before. We're not hitting up a brand-new new kind of push out. I mean the push out has been a continuous phenomena as our suppliers are dealing with their own COVID-19 shutdowns based on where they produce ability to hire and all that, we have substantial equipment coming in line. This quarter, some came online last quarter, and some will come in line in December quarter, which we think will continue to add to internal capacity to grow our business.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. And we are clearly not instructing our capital equipment suppliers to push anything out. We still need this equipment coming in as soon as we can get it.
Ganesh Moorthy: If anything, as I've mentioned in other calls, we are preferentially helping all of our capital equipment suppliers by providing them semiconductor solutions to the extent they are constrained, so that it helps not just us but helps the industry complete the equipment that they're building.
Steve Sanghi: So the other point I wanted to reemphasize, and I think Ganesh said that, where to the extent our foundry and assembly and test partners are seeing some slowdown in the business coming from consumer PCs and cell phones. We are taking advantage of it because we have been able to increase the output by taking that slack both at the foundries and assembly/test OSAT guys, in addition to our incremental capacity. And hopefully, we will continue to take advantage of that and capitalize on the upside. That's where we're able to say the growth in the business, again this quarter that we guided a 5% midpoint and we're talking about growth again next quarter.
Chris Rolland: Thatâs great. Thanks guys. Thatâs always insightful.
Ganesh Moorthy: Great. Thank you.
Operator: It appears that there is no further question at this time. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Ganesh Moorthy: We thank you all for attending and taking time from your day to be in this call. And we look forward to speaking to many of you as well as seeing some of you at some of the conferences we'll be at. So thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-05-09 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Microchip's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Financial Results. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt : Thanks, Erin, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO, Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and this conference call, on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on our Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses part of the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation, and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. Net sales in the March quarter were $1.844 billion, which was up 4.9% sequentially, and near the high end of our quarterly guidance. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference. Going forward, we will only be providing GAAP net sales by product line and geography, consistent with the standard practice by our peer companies. We will continue to provide information each quarter on changes in distribution inventory levels. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 66.6%. Operating expenses were at 21.9%, and operating income was a record 44.7%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $764.6 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.35, $0.10 above the midpoint of our guidance, $0.07 of which was driven by favorable events in the March quarter, benefiting our cash tax expense. On a GAAP basis, in the March quarter, gross margins were a record at 66.2%. Total operating expenses were $670.9 million, and included acquisition intangible amortization of $215.5 million, special charges of $9.1 million, $3.8 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and share-based compensation of $39 million. GAAP net income was $437.9 million or $0.77 per diluted share, and was adversely impacted by an $11.8 million loss on debt settlement associated with our convertible debt refinancing activities. Our March quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably the tax benefits recorded as a result of releasing the unrecognized tax benefit due to the closing of an audit in Europe. For fiscal year 2022, net sales were a record $6.82 billion and were up 25.4% from net sales in fiscal year 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 65.7%. Operating expenses were 22.2% of sales and operating income was a record 43.5% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was a record $2.611 billion and EPS was a record at $4.61 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 65.2%. Operating expenses were 38.1% of sales, and operating income was 27.1% of sales. Net income was $1.286 billion, and EPS was $2.27 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 1.3% in the March quarter and 4.9% for fiscal year 2022. The non-GAAP cash tax rate in the March quarter was lower than originally forecasted, due to a variety of factors, including the receipt of a tax refund that had not been forecasted to be received until a later date, lower taxes in certain jurisdictions, and tax benefits from our convertible debt exchanges. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '23 to be between 7.5% and 11.5%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure, and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. The midpoint of our June quarter tax rate guidance is 9.5%. Our fiscal '23 cash tax rate is higher than our fiscal '22 tax cash rate for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. Our inventory balance at March 31, 2022, was $854.4 million. We had 125 days of inventory at the end of the March quarter, which was up 9 days from the prior quarter's level. Our levels of raw materials and work in progress increased in the quarter, which helps position us for the increased production we are expecting from our internal factories and helps buffer us against unexpected shortages or changes in material lead times. The carrying cost of our inventory has been and will be increasing due to the rising input costs from our supply chain. We are continuing to ramp capacity in our internal and external factories, so we can ship as much product as possible to support customer requirements. Inventory at our distributors in the March quarter were at 17 days, which is a record low level and down from 19 days at the end of the prior quarter. Following on the heels of our upgrade to investment grade or BBB minus in the December 2021 quarter, during the March 2022 quarter, we were upgraded to the equivalent of BBB by both Moody's and Fitch, reflecting the strength of our balance sheet, financial results and our franchise. In the March quarter, we exchanged a total of $64.9 million of principal value of our 2027 convertible subordinated notes for cash and shares of our common stock. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the principal amount of the convertible debt exchanges, and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time.  The principal amount of convertible debt on our balance sheet at March 31 was $838.1 million. This includes $665.5 million of convertible bonds maturing in November of 2024 with the cap call option in place that offsets any potential dilution from these convertibles up to stock prices of $116.79. At the beginning of calendar year 2020, Microchip had $4.481 billion in convertible bonds outstanding. So today, our overall capital structure is in a much better long-term position. Our cash flow from operating activities was $747.7 million in the March quarter. Our free cash flow was $633.1 million and 34.3% of net sales. As of March 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $319.4 million. We paid down $205.9 million of total debt in the March quarter. Over the last 15 full quarters, since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $5 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash, beyond dividends and stock buyback, to bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during the earlier years of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business, as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the March quarter was a record at $902.6 million and 48.9% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $3.246 billion and 47.6% of net sales. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.32 at March 31, 2022, down from 2.58 at December 31, 2021, and down from 3.76 at March 31, 2021. Our dividend payment in the March quarter was $140.8 million, and we repurchased 259.6 million of our stock during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $114.6 million in the March quarter and $370.1 million for fiscal year 2022. We had originally forecasted capital expenditures of about $140 million in the March quarter, and we experienced delays in receiving some of our capital equipment from our suppliers. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 is between $450 million and $550 million, as we continue to take actions to support the growth of our business and ramp our manufacturing operations. We continue to prudently add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected long-term growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business, and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $59.3 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter as well as our guidance for the June quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter results were very strong across the board, and set several records in the process. Revenue grew 4.9% sequentially and 25.7% on a year-over-year basis to achieve an all-time record of $1.84 billion. Despite a number of operational challenges, including the rapid spread of the COVID Omicron virus, which affected several of our factories, the shutdowns in several cities in China, and the suspension of shipments to Russia, we finished just shy of the high end of our revenue guidance. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of new revenue records. Non-GAAP gross margin was another record of 66.6%, up 50 basis points from the December quarter, and at the high end of our guidance, as we continue to ramp our internal factories and benefit from improved operational efficiencies as well as product mix changes. Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record of 44.7%, very close to the high end of our guidance. At 21.9% operating expenses, we are 60 basis points below the low end of our long-term model of 22.5% to 23.5%. Our long-term operating expense model will continue to guide our actions to invest for the long-term growth and profitability of our business. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS was a record $1.35 per share, well over the high end of our guidance and up 45.2% from the year ago quarter. Even after excluding the tax benefit we received, our March quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS at $1.28, was at the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA at 28.9% of revenue and free cash flow at 34.3% of revenue, were both very strong in the March quarter, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation capabilities of our business. Net debt declined by $209.8 million, driving our net leverage ratio down to 2.32 in the March quarter, as we continue to relentlessly drive down our net leverage. During the March quarter, we returned $400.4 million to shareholders, representing 52.5% of the prior quarter's free cash flow. Reflecting on our fiscal year '22 results, it was one for the record books, and one of our best years ever. We made dramatic progress on all fronts, revenue growth, gross and operating margins, earnings per share, free cash flow generation, debt and leverage reduction, and last but not least, we significantly increased the capital return to shareholders through dividend increases and the initiation of a programmatic share buyback program. At our Investor Day in November 2021, we outlined our plan to increase the capital return to shareholders every quarter, as our net leverage continues to drop. We are making consistent and meaningful progress towards our net leverage growth every quarter. I would like to take this opportunity to profusely thank all our stakeholders, who enabled us to achieve these outstanding results and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team for their never-give-up attitude and concerted effort to consistently deliver results to support our customers, in the face of a historic and persistent imbalance between supply and demand. Taking a look at our revenue from a product line perspective, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up a strong 7.6% as compared to the December quarter, and was another all-time record. On an annualized basis, our March quarter microcontroller revenue broke through the $4 billion mark for the first time. On a year-over-year basis, our March quarter microcontroller revenue was up 28.3%. All microcontroller product lines, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, experienced strong growth and achieved record revenue milestones. 32-bit microcontrollers had the highest growth and is now the largest microcontroller product line for us at 46.5% of our microcontroller revenue. Microcontrollers represented 56.7% of our revenue in the March quarter. Our analog revenue sequentially increased 3% in the March quarter, setting another record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, our March quarter analog revenue was up a strong 24.2%. Analog represented 27.9% of our revenue in the March quarter. Taking a look at our revenue from a geographic and end market perspective, Americas was up 21.4% over the prior year quarter. Europe was up 25% over the prior year quarter. Asia was up 27.9% over the prior year quarter. All end markets remained strong and were supply constrained. Business conditions continue to be exceptionally strong through the quarter. Our preferred supply program, our PSP backlog, continued to grow and remained well over 50% of our aggregate backlog and 100% of our backlog in the most constrained capacity product areas. Demand continued to be insatiable, despite the significant capacity increases, we have implemented so far. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which represents customer backlog -- backlog that customers want to ship to them in the March quarter, but which we could not deliver in the March quarter, climbed substantially again as we exited the March quarter with our highest unsupported backlog ever. We continue to experience constraints in all our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. We are ramping our internal factories as fast as reasonably possible. And we are working closely with our supply chain partners to secure additional capacity wherever possible. Our supply chain partners as well as some of our customers were adversely impacted by the lockdowns in China during March, which continued into April and May. Our operations team worked to redirect our manufacturing activities and sourcing wherever possible to other locations that are not locked down. Looking at the magnitude of the demand supply inbound, the size of our non-cancelable backlog, the rate at which new backlog continues to come in, and the rate at which we're able to bring on new capacity, we expect that we will remain supply constrained throughout 2022 and into 2023. Our growth is predominantly limited by how quickly we can bring on additional capacity to support demand. To reiterate what we first shared with you in March this year, we expect our 5-year compounded annual growth rate, using fiscal year 2021 as a baseline, to be 10% to 15%. We expect our capital spending in fiscal year '23 to be at the high end of the range we have shared with you, as we respond to growth opportunities in our business as well as fill gaps in the level of capacity investments being made by our outsourced manufacturing partners in specialized technologies, they consider to be trailing edge, but which we believe will be workhorse technologies for us for many years to come. We believe our calibrated increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, serve our customers better, increase our market share, improve our gross margins, and give us more control over our destiny, especially for specialized trailing-edge technologies. We will, of course, continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsourced partners, but our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities in areas where they don't align with our business needs. Now let's get into the guidance for the June quarter. Our backlog for the June quarter is very strong, and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the June quarter to be up between 4% and 8% sequentially. Our guidance range assumes capacity additions, as well as continued materials and capacity challenges, some of which will work -- expect to work through during the quarter, others that will carry over to be worked in future quarters. We have also included the anticipated effects of the lockdowns in China on our supply chain partners as well as our customers. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the June quarter would be a strong 24.6%. For the June quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 66.8% and 67.2% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 21.6% and 22% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating profit to be between 44.8% and 45.6% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.32 per share and $1.36 per share, after comprehending the higher tax rate that Eric shared with you. Finally, as you can see from our March quarter results and the June quarter guidance, every element of our Microchip 3.0 strategy is firing on all cylinders, as we continue to build and improve what we believe is one of the most diversified, defensible, high growth, high margin, high cash generating businesses in the semiconductor industry. To summarize the essential elements of Microchip 3.0, they are, organic growth rate of 10% to 15% in the fiscal year '22 to ‘26-time frame, by focusing on total system solutions and our key market megatrends. Long-term non-GAAP operating margin target of 44% to 46%, and free cash flow target of 38%, consistently increasing capital return to shareholders as net leverage drops such that 100% of free cash flow is returned to shareholders by the time net leverage drops to 1.5x, a CapEx investment of 3% to 6% of revenue, and an inventory investment of 130 to 150 days over the business cycles. And last but not least, a strong company foundation built on culture and sustainability. Let me now pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter and fiscal year, while making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non-GAAP EPS, and record adjusted EBITDA, and all of that in a very challenging supply environment. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 9.1% from last quarter to $0.276 per share. This is an increase of 33.7% from a year ago quarter. During the last quarter, we purchased $259.6 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $140.8 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $400.4 million. This amount was 52% of our actual free cash flow of $762.7 million during the December 2021 quarter. Our pay down of debt as well as record adjusted EBITDA, drove down our net leverage at the end of March 2022 quarter to 2.32 from 2.58 at the end of December. In the current June quarter, we will use last quarter's actual free cash flow of $633.1 million and expect to return $348.2 million, which is 55% of that amount to our shareholders. Out of this $348.2 million, the dividend is expected to be approximately $153.2 million and the stock buyback is expected to be approximately $195 million. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator:  And we will take our first question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Wonder if you could just talk to your visibility into the supply remaining kite in the context of markets that you guys don't serve if you're seeing smartphones feel a little bit weaker, you should be seeing foundry capacity free up in other places. Do you see that showing light at the end of the tunnel in a supply situation or no?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, because we're not in the end markets you described like smartphones, we don't have direct visibility into what they're facing. We do read the same industry reports as to what might be happening. There is sometimes a delay between when something is perceived to be in the market to when it actually filters into the supply chains. And at this point in time, we do not see any major relief in the capacity as a result of some other end market that is weak. That may happen in time, but not at this point.
Joe Moore: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities.
Gary Mobley: Let me extend my congratulations to a strong finish to the fiscal year. You mentioned that your first quarter guide contemplates a lot of the different issues that we're all dealing with, including supply chain issues and customers' inability to manufacture. I was hoping maybe you can break that down quantify the total impact that you have embedded in your first quarter guidance and what the split may be between customer-specific issues your own supply chain issues?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's a good question, but it's a very difficult question to quantify the way that you're looking for. There are upsides and downsides, and the different risks that we're dealing with. What we have applied is a way to look at all of that and come up with an aggregate risk that we have built into the guidance. And so I don't have a specific breakdown that would be helpful to you on China customer or China supply or Russia, et cetera. It's all built in to what we have. And we know that they're going to come at us with a slightly different twist than what we're thinking about, and all that is built into the guidance we've provided.
Gary Mobley: Okay. Eric, if I can ask a follow-up question. You mentioned that distribution inventory is at an all-time record low down 2 days sequentially. But I think you've now had maybe 3 quarters in a row of sell into the distribution channel greater than sell out, albeit a fairly minor difference. What's the reason for the divergence there?
Eric Bjornholt: Well, I just view the difference is really small. If you look at our fiscal year, I think there's an $11 million difference between GAAP revenue and what sell-through was through distribution channels. So I think it's minor. Distributors are challenged, just like customers are today in terms of getting the product that they need to support their customers. We're generally seeing that what we're shipping into them is shipping out almost immediately to support their customers. And they also have a lower percentage of their backlog typically that is on the PSP program. And that has impacted their availability to get supply as some of the direct customers that got into PSP earlier or have a stronger presence in PSP, have that priority of supply.
Ganesh Moorthy: Gary, what I would also add is that, as business grows, distribution almost, by definition, needs more products shipped into them in order for them to be able to prepare for that growth. The days of inventory is a more normalizing indicator that tells you how is -- what they're getting as a function of what is it that they're shipping through. So there is no concern with the fact that we are shipping in slightly more. And as Eric mentioned, it's pretty small in the grand scheme of things. Despite that and despite the growth, the days of inventory are declining quite significantly, going from 19 to 17. And I think that is a more meaningful indicator as what's going on in distribution.
Gary Mobley: Thanks guys.
Operator: And our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my questions. There's a lot of concern about the possible downturn whether it's late this year or next year. So Ganesh, I wanted to get your thoughts on reality versus perception. And let's say, in a scenario of Microchip sales were to decline 5% or 10% next year hypothetically, what happens to gross margins? Because if I go back in history, the last time there was a meaningful sales decline was in 2009 and gross margins declined about 6 points or so. Is that the kind of decline that could potentially happen? So just give us your thoughts on a potential for a downturn, if you're seeing anything. And then if there were to be one, what happens to gross margins?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's a hard question to take in the hypothetical, but let's look at where some of the cushions are if and when that change happens, right? So I think we were just talking about distribution inventory at 17 days, right? I mean distribution is running on fumes. And to run healthy, they need to be in that high 20s kind of days of inventory, sometimes slightly higher than that. So I think that is the first part of what we would need to do with is utilize the opportunity if it is this down cycle at some point to replenish distribution to run healthy for a normal business. Second is when you look at our inventory, right, we really -- our inventory is up in a few days. But really, when you look at the inventory at the points that are in die bank, in finished goods, those are all still running on fumes for us given the mix of our products. We have a significant amount of internal inventory replenishment, et cetera, to be done. And finally, I think we have conveyed that while products are such long-lasting products, that we intend to build inventory in a down cycle, because that is the most effective capacity we can have rather than trying to get CapEx to go up when the next up cycle comes about. We had constraints in doing that in the last cycle, when we were more cash constrained given the debt that we have. We don't have those same constraints. And so our products last 10, 15, 20 years, and we fully expect that we will utilize our capacity and be more capital efficient through the cycle, whenever that cycle happens.
Steve Sanghi: I'd like to add to that, Vivek, your question began with, if Microchip goes down 5% to 7%, and then you compared it to 2009, when over a 6-month period, industry and Microchip's revenue was down 35%, in the middle of a global financial crisis. So I don't think anybody is looking for that kind of downturn last -- next year, where the revenue goes down that much percentage. So I think 6% gross margin drop in 2009 environment is scary. And I don't think we are expecting that kind next year, even if the sales were to drop 5% for the elements that Ganesh pointed out, it will take us a period of a year at least to really rebuild our own inventory, restock distribution and get everything healthy. So I don't really think there is that much concern about gross margin dropping that much.
Operator: And Tore Svanberg with Stifel has our next question.
Tore Svanberg: And congrats on all the record numbers. A question on CapEx. You didn't quite get to the number you wanted this quarter. You cited some delays in equipment sales. I was just wondering if the situation there is improving or not, just quarter-over-quarter, because clearly, the last quarter, things were still pretty constrained to get equipment, but are you seeing any improvement there at all?
Ganesh Moorthy: No, I think it's still a challenge to get equipment. And over the last 4, 5 quarters, it's become more challenging to get equipment in on time. So delays are there. It's a bit of a vicious cycle. Many of the delays are caused by shortages in semiconductor components. Those in turn, delay the equipment, which delays the ability to solve that problem. We have, in fact, taken the initiative to prioritize supply for many of the semiconductor equipment manufacturers, so that we do our part to both help the industry and help ourselves in doing that, and I believe others are doing it as well. But at the moment, the equipment lead times are getting worse, not better.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Chris Caso: Your question about some of the capacity additions and specifically, the timing of when we could expect more substantial capacity to come online. I think what you've said previously is that your capacity would come on in a fairly linear even fashion, as you brought on more supply. With some of the CapEx jump that you'd have into fiscal '23, when does that start to have an impact? And then there is a bit of an inflection point in your ability to supply and therefore, revenue once that CapEx turns into actual capacity?
Ganesh Moorthy: So Chris, there's no single point at which there is a step function change in our capacity. We are getting capacity increases every quarter. As equipment comes in, it gets qualified, installed and begins to run production. Some of that is in our front-end fabs. Some of that is not back-end factories as the case might be. In certain cases, we are expanding clean room and that clean room space comes on at a certain point in time, which allows us to put in place more equipment. But it's more of a continuum of capacity increases that is taking place. And every quarter, we are increasing capacity. In some cases, it requires equipment. In other cases, it's really just hiring the people to run the equipment that we have. And all of that is kind of a more continuous process every quarter rather than a step function in any given quarter.
Chris Caso: Got it. As a follow-up, I wonder if you could give some color on some of your end markets. And are there any areas where you've seen demand substantially increase or decrease? I mean, elsewhere from other earnings reports, where we've seen some changes are largely areas you don't participate very much in, handset and PC. But interesting, if you've seen anything of note within your end markets that you wish to talk about?
Ganesh Moorthy: As I mentioned, all end markets are strong. Maybe the one of note would be, we are seeing more strength in the defense, aerospace end of the market. Commercial aviation is coming back. And so some of the folks that were not building are starting to build more. There are going to be some defense-related items given some of what's going on geopolitically that will come through. But that's a small part of our overall business. So it's still got significant strength in the other 5 end markets that we're in.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi.
Chris Danely: A bit of a longer-term question. So in the past -- I guess, in the recent past, you've asked you about additional acquisitions. You said that, that avenue has pretty much been closed, because there's, to paraphrase you, not much out there and things are expensive. I'm just wondering if your thought process has changed at all, given that the stocks have sold off that. Do you think that this upturn will be more sustainable than in the past and there's extra capacity seems like it's sort of at a premium out there? Has anything changed as far as the thought process goes?
Ganesh Moorthy: Not really. I think what we had said is we met the major objectives we had when we went on our multiyear acquisition path. The two big ones at that time to be able to build scale and the other one was to build out the portfolio to be broader than what it was 10 years ago. Having reached both those objectives, we think there is more to be had in focusing and harnessing organically what we have and getting the best of what we have. So we were doing more acquisitions when the available growth was also limited, and we wanted to augment our organic growth with the acquisitions. We believe we're at a point in time, where there is a substantially higher organic growth opportunity available. And the most cost-effective growth, we think, is organic, and that is where we're focused with the many specific strategies that we have put in place for that as large acquisitions. And of course, we still do small pinpoint acquisitions that are tuck-ins intended for technology, market or customers from time to time.
Chris Danely: Thanks guys. 
Ganesh Moorthy: Welcome. 
Steve Sanghi: In today's environment, you couldn't get the benefit of cross-selling on a new acquisition, because there's no capacity. You would simply be inheriting the capacity challenges of an acquiree. And if there are any cross-selling opportunities to grow revenue, you won't have capacity for it, because we're constrained even just shipping our organic growth.
Operator:  We'll now hear from William Stein with Truist Securities.
William Stein: Thanks so much for taking my questions. Congrats on the results and outlook. I'm hoping you might dissect the growth either year-over-year or sequentially by units versus pricing? And if you could also comment on the effect that that's having on gross margins, because, of course, I'm pretty sure you guys use FIFO inventory, so you have lower-cost products flowing through the P&L on higher-priced products to customers? Any clarity on those would really help? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: So directionally, when I look at it year-over-year, is that a component of the growth that comes from price, yes. The majority of the growth is coming from units, and price, as we have talked about before, is predominantly for us to be able to address cost increases that we have incurred, which we batch and pass on from time to time to our customers. The gross margin benefits of the price increase are really not something we target to go get. I'll let Eric speak to maybe the timing of the FIFO inventory and all that, but largely, we're not trying to boost up gross margins through the price changes that we're making.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. So from a timing perspective, as Ganesh said, we try to batch these pricing increases, as things are starting to flow through the P&L. And it's not a perfect process, but that's what we try to do. Again, we're not trying to gouge customers. We're trying to pass along the cost and earn what I would call a standard margin on that, but not be a gross margin percentage enhancer. So with 100,000 SKUs in the portfolio, again, it's not a perfect process, but I think we've done a good job of doing that and being fair with our customers.
Operator: And our next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.
Harsh Kumar: First of all, congratulations, great results, great guide. Steve, the question that a lot of us have been trying to ask in a variety of different ways. I think it's this, that when you look at the revenue growth of not just Microchip, but the industry associated with the auto business overall, the chip business overall, when you look at the growth rate, and you try and compare that with the growth rate in autos and your account for the content gains, which I know are very strong, we still end up with a lot of gap. And that's probably the area that I get the most amount of questions on the buy side. I was curious if you might have some thoughts on what is happening? Why is the semiconductor industry benefiting to such a great degree and that gap is so wide?
Ganesh Moorthy: So let me take that. I think if you look at the automotive industry, in some ways, I look at their results over the last 4 or 5 quarters, and I think a semiconductor shortage is probably the best that happened to them. Every one of them has record results, record profitability, whether that is at the OEM level or the Tier 1 level. And why? What they have done is really utilized the available semiconductor supply they have to build the richest product line that they can build. And if you try to go to a dealer today and try to buy a de-featured car, it's not available. You can get it in a year's time or whenever they tell you it is. And so the semiconductor content per car on average has grown up, because the mix has become much richer. Things that perhaps were optional or not available before, are becoming more standard, because in a smaller number of cars they want to sell, they are utilizing as many semiconductors has become available for that smaller number of cars to have the richest product line. And secondly, from an automotive standpoint, there are no discounts available. So all of the discounting that took place is a gross margin tailwind for the automotive guys. So the chips we're selling -- and by the way, our shortages that we deal with, with the automotive customers hasn't really abated in the last year. We still have significant escalations and issues that we're working with, with not just automotive but just about every industry, but automotive specific since you asked that. So, there is no indication that all is quiet on the automotive front with respect to the getting product that they need. They are still fighting through shortages in order to be able to build exactly the cars and the mix of product that they want to make.
Harsh Kumar: Very helpful guys. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.
Christopher Rolland: Also congrats. Microcontrollers, you guys had some interesting revelations there, I guess, on 32-bit becoming the majority there. I would love to know kind of how you see longer-term growth rates between maybe 8-bit and 32-bit and as 32-bit accelerates, is that a tailwind for you guys for gross margin?
Ganesh Moorthy: So first, maybe to parse out, right? All three, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit are still setting new records. So all are growing. Clearly, there is a higher growth rate on the 32-bit, which is why it grew the most, and it's now approaching almost half of the microcontroller revenue. Now we continue to expect that the usage of microcontrollers and the embedding of intelligence in lots and lots of end applications is a critical secular trend that has a tailwind for our business overall. We've kind of represented and shown that in the 6 megatrends, and how what we do fits in those kind of end market or end applications and drives growth for us. Now to your second question on gross margin, the gross margin of the microcontroller business is not dramatically different between 8s, 16s and 32s. And so we go to market with an approach that allows any one of our products to be utilized, depending on what is most appropriate in the customer situation, and the pricing is to the value that we bring into that application. And so the general gross margin, we don't believe is affected by the mix of 8s, 16s and 32-bit.
Christopher Rolland: Great. Thank you, Ganesh. And then 1 for either you or Steve. A lot of people have talked about potential over capacity for the industry in '23 and '24. Would love to get kind of your views on whether you think that's a thing or not? And what its effect on industry pricing might be?
Ganesh Moorthy: So I'll give you my view and then maybe Steve will add to it as well. So it's a bit of a misnomer when you talk about overcapacity in '23 or '24, when you look at where is the CapEx being spent by the industry, industry spent over $100 million of CapEx last year. The vast majority of that CapEx, over 90% of it, is being spent on the bleeding edge nodes. These are the nodes that are 16-nanometer and smaller, so 16, 10, 7, 5, 3, et cetera, is where all that is being spent.  Where the capacity is not being invested in at the rates that are required, and where, for example, all of the constraints that the industry is fighting through short, medium and long term, are on these trailing edge, specialty technologies. On 300-millimeter, that is typically anything which is 40-nanometer and larger in size, very little capacity investment coming online to be able to help that. On 200-millimeter, 8-inch wafers, there's almost nothing that is being done, outside of what some of the IDMs have been doing and which really is still a far cry from what is needed. So while there is CapEx spending taking place of quite significant amount, it is being spent disproportionately on the bleeding edge technologies, and there are still significant constraints left on the trailing edge, specialty technologies that we don't see easing up into '23 and '24. Steve, do you want to add some more to it?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. Yes, I would. So what has happened historically is that the foundries built a leading-edge fab, depreciated it fully over 4 years, providing leading-edge chips to the likes of Qualcomm and AMD and others. And when the leading-edge guys moved to the next node, then they took that capacity, a depreciated fab and repurposed it for microcontroller, mixed-signal, connectivity and those kind of products. And that's how over many, many years, trailing as a capacity became available. Now what has happened now is that link is broken. The leading-edge lithography has gone to 14-nanometer, 10-nanometer, even 7, 5 and 3-nanometer, while the microcontrollers and analog, because of functionality needed, are still in the range of 65-nanometer to 180-nanometer. And so therefore, the trailing edge capacity no longer easily becomes available, because somebody moved to the next node. Secondly, starting at 19-nanometer, the wafers became 12-inch, less than 19 nanometer, the wafer's at 8-inch. And 8-inches largely aluminum back end and 12 inches largely copper back end, and one is not compatible with the other. So a 12-inch fab becoming available, doesn't easily give the capacity for an 8-inch product to move to 12-inch. So combination of those factors and the fact that the foundries are adding almost no capacity on the trailing edge, it is quite possible that the trailing edge capacity is forever constrained. And that's why we are making aggressive attempts to add capacity internally to provide that growth to our business and to our customers, and you're seeing some of our competitors do the same thing.
Operator: We will now take a question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong margins and overall execution. Currently, you're not quite where you want to be on OpEx as a percent of sales, but your business is growing strongly. So it's hard to bring on personnel at a faster pace than your business is growing. But won't you guys have the same challenge longer term, given your new long-term revenue CAGR of 10% to 15%. Given your revenue scale, can the team really grow its OpEx by double-digit percentage points going forward to maintain your OpEx target?  I guess my point is, with the accelerated rate revenue growth targets and $8 billion of revenue scale, it would seem that you'll be driving stronger leverage on the operating margin than what your model implies, because you kept your operating margin targets unchanged when you increased your 4-year revenue CAGR. Am I missing something?
Steve Sanghi: I'll give you a…
Ganesh Moorthy: I will want to add to it as well. I think investments in the operating expense are not just in people alone. That is clearly one of the large investments we've got to make. But beyond that, there's an intellectual property. There's work we have to do this research and development work that takes place, which has wafers and other things we have to do. So we do believe that strong gross margin and strong growth businesses don't fall out of the sky. They need to be thought through, invested in and executed. And we need to make sure that while today's gross margins are strong and where they're at, that we continue to build for the future in a competitive world, that ensures that continued new products and technologies, and the associated marketing and other activities we need to do, will be able to keep those gross margins high and keep the growth rates high in where we're at. And today's environment is a bit challenging also, because of the availability of people is I think that won't be there forever. So we do expect that in time, we will solve some of those shortages of being able to hire people, et cetera, and do need to get back into the range that we have provided. And that's what creates a sustainable high gross margin business. Do you want to add to it?
Eric Bjornholt: I think the only other thing I would add is just a point of clarification on the statement that you made in your question, Harlan, is that we are targeting this 10% to 15% CAGR on revenue based on fiscal '21 as a baseline, right? We just completed fiscal '22, which is a very strong growth year. We're expecting another strong growth year, but I don't want you or investors to necessarily just put in your model 10% to 15% on a perpetual basis going forward. We'll have to see how that plays out over time, but that's a 5-year CAGR based off of fiscal '21 as the baseline.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pradeep Ramani with UBS.
Pradeep Ramani: Can you speak to maybe the trends with respect to how your backlog and largely unsupported backlog, how it sort of grew in June versus March. And maybe even address it from the perspective of PSP. Is your PSP duration stretching quarter-over-quarter? Or is it about the same? Can you help us with that?
Ganesh Moorthy: So the PSP program requires 12 months of continuous non-cancelable backlog. Many customers choose to go longer than that. And we don't really track what is the -- what percentage of that is above or below where it is. We make sure that everybody is in compliance with the program. But we do have a meaningful amount of that backlog that is more than 12 months. And we do have overall PSP backlog continuing to grow. So that's one part of the question. And the other part of it is, exiting the March quarter, our unsupported backlog grew again quite significantly. And that is the sixth or seventh or some consecutive quarter of continuing expansion of unsupported, just giving you the sense of how -- no matter how much incremental capacity we have brought on, we continue to be falling behind versus the intensity of demand. So it's just -- it's not supplies and coming online. It's just demand is outgrowing supply multiple quarters and expanding that gap between supply and demand.
Eric Bjornholt: I think I would just add two points. Ganesh said one of these already, but in the quarter, total backlog grew, unsupported backlog grew and PSP backlog grew. So all of them were up quarter-on-quarter.
Operator: And we'll now take a question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava: I had a question on lead times. Have lead times stabilized? You folks have been adding capacity, which should translate into some alleviation. So just a question on lead times. And then, Ganesh, you talked about the price increase. And as it relates to the PSP, what has been the reaction to the price increase programs that you have in place?
Ganesh Moorthy: So lead times are long. I wouldn't say that they're stabilized. Some of the constraints are still quite acute. And to the extent that demand continues to grow faster than supply, the only way to solve is on lead times. So lead times have been stretching out more so on some products, perhaps than other products, and where they're at. On the pricing increase and PSP, so any time we increase prices, our customers have a small window in which they have the opportunity to refuse the price increase, and cancel the backlog if they so wish. And we have the opportunity to adjust the price, if we so wish, which we have not done. What customers have in the course of the price increase that we have done, the amount of backlog that they have chosen to cancel is so small, it's almost immeasurable in the grand scheme of what we have. And so there has been no final impact of the price increase in our PSP backlog.
Ambrish Srivastava: Just sorry, just a clarification. What I meant to ask on lead times was that our lead times continuing to go up or the rate of the increase has slowed down considerably because -- and I forget, what is the capacity that you've brought online on a year-over-year basis?
Ganesh Moorthy: There's no easy answer to give you on what -- so capacity is a function of our internal capacity, our external capacity, specific packages, some materials which have constraints in the industry like substrates, et cetera. So in any given product package combination, the constraints can be quite large and can be well over a year in lead time. In others as we are alleviating them we may get to where it's not pushing out as much or at least stabilizing there. So -- but in the aggregate, I would say that lead times have not stabilized and that constraints continue to grow. And as our imbalance between supply and demand grows every quarter, it solves on time.
Operator: Our next question will come from Chris Danely with Citi.
Chris Danely: Let me ask a follow-up, just a quick one. I guess for Ganesh or maybe the stage of semiconductor, Steve saying you will take a shot at it. Did you guys quantify the impact from the China COVID shutdowns on your business? And then also, any insights as to how come you are managing to have it affect you a little bit less than some of your peers?
Ganesh Moorthy: So we did not break out what the China COVID impact is. Clearly, there are impacts from both supply, where we have manufacturing partners and supply chains that are affected, and there are customers, who are in the regions that are shut down and unable to conduct business in what they're doing. We have comprehended the impact from both the supply and the demand side into the guidance that we have provided. And beyond that, we're not trying to break it down any further than that. As far as what other people have done and how do we think, I honestly don't know, because it's all a function of what percent of their manufacturing or customer base is in the affected area, and that is not very knowable for us. So I presume each company has the insight into their business to provide the guidance that they think is right.
Steve Sanghi: So let me add to that. I think the amount of China exposure, both on the supply chain as well as customers is different for different companies. When it comes to supply chain, we have moved a fair amount of supply chain out of China when there were tariffs put on China back in 2019. A lot of them we left outside of China. So we had substantially lowered our exposure for the supply chain. That could be one. In terms of the impact we're having on Chinese customers in Shanghai, yes, we have finite impact on that, but we were able to take that supply and ship it elsewhere, because of the larger delinquencies. So we were largely able to mitigate the impact of customers not wanting to accept the product, because they were closed.
Operator: Our next question will come from David O'Connor with BNP Paribas.
David O'Connor: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Ganesh, a question on silicon carbide. You had some new product announcements on silicon carbide in the quarter, pretty much around charging stations and on the industrial side. Can you just talk about Microchip's strategy and positioning there within silicon carbide? Is that just really focused on high voltage and a very particular application? And related to that as well, the -- as silicon carbon ramps up, is that a headwind to gross margin? That's my first question. And then maybe just a follow-up on the CapEx for next year. You mentioned at the high end of the range. Could you give us any sense of what portion of that is maintenance versus capacity expansion?
Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So our silicon carbide technology, came to us from the Microsemi acquisition, has a heritage started in aerospace and defense and therefore, has a substantial DNA that is built around robustness and reliability for where it's at. We have since continued to build that technology out and expand its focus into industrial and automotive, with a higher interest in industrial, because it's faster time to market, but also because it has a far more gross margin characteristics that align with where Microchip's interest are at.  And so that's what we have done is continue to bring out new products that have higher voltage capabilities. High voltage is an indication of robustness and its ability to operate in these harsh environments. Bring out more product categories, I think we, at this point, probably have one of the larger catalog of silicon carbide products in the market. And we are prosecuting these in a broad range of applications with obviously a high degree of industrial customers, some in automotive. And in Industrial, the one example you just cited, which is EV chargers is a key reference design for us for our total system solutions, not just for silicon carbide, but for many other parts of that solution that we bring that we're finding great success in.
Eric Bjornholt: The second piece of your question was on CapEx, and it was maintenance versus expansion. And I would say the majority of our capital is going to be expansion. There's always some maintenance. You can look at some down years that we've seen or the industry has seen in the past, and our CapEx is relatively minimal. It might be $60 million, $70 million, $75 million, but we're also running our factories very hard now. And with that, there is a required maintenance that has to happen. So I don't have a specific percentage for you, but the largest portion of it will be expansion capital.
Operator: Our next question will come from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research.
Nik Todorov: Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. And congrats on great results. I wanted to go back on the question about lagging edge capacity. Steve, I think your comments are very illuminating and explaining one of the reasons why lagging edge capacity is not as much as probably historically. But I just wonder why do you think is going to remain constrained, given the fact that you and other peers are seeing substantial amount of unsupported backlog, tons of orders into visibility and for years ahead. So it seems like there's definitely demand out there. And also profitability for you and peers that are operating in that lagging edge capacity is an all-time high. So can you talk maybe 1 of the other factors why is lagging edge investments or lagging edge investments not going up?
Ganesh Moorthy: So when you talk to the foundry companies, their opportunity cost of investing in trailing edge is high as compared to making that same investment in leading edge. And so they have finite resources, finite bandwidth, and they need to decide where to put it. And right now, what we see and what they tell us is, that is going in the way that they are investing their CapEx, which is mostly at the leading edge of where they're at. There is also not always sufficient understanding of how trailing edge is a critical part of certain markets, particularly for certain product types, where the benefits of going to leading edge are very small to sometimes it's a negative to go take it, the leading edge in terms of cost and performance, et cetera. So that understanding is among a smaller set of companies. And typically, they will be the ones that are closer to their own manufacturing and understand what it takes. And so we just don't see a broad-based capacity investment by external foundries in trailing edge capacity given both their knowledge of the market, but also their priority in a constrained environment for their people their CapEx and their bandwidth.
Operator: We'll take a question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities.
Craig Ellis: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on the real strong margins, team. I just wanted to follow up on that last point and a few of the capacity-related points. But my question is really around external supply. Can you just talk about some of the gives and takes very recently with external supply? And given the commentary around foundries not investing as intensively, help us understand how the company feels about the external supplies contribution to the 10% to 15% longer-term growth rate? Do you feel like that, with your partners, you've got commitments to supply that can get you to that 10% to 15%? Or what will that part of supply do, if you can't get the supply that you need?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. So we have every confidence that the capacity that we need to support our growth, through a combination of internal and external actions, will be there. And we will continue to work with existing partners. In some cases, we will work with new partners. We will, in many cases, partner in new and unique ways where we need to, to ensure that the capacity is there. And we are doing quite a bit on our internal capacity, right? That's where the whole the CapEx that we have talked about is also aimed at in order to be -- to ensure that high-growth high-margin, long-term business can continue to be done internally where we can do it cost effectively.
Operator: And we have no further questions queued at this time. So I'll turn things back over to Ganesh Moorthy for any additional or closing remarks.
Ganesh Moorthy: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We look forward to seeing many of you on the circuit over the next couple of months, as we're out of different conferences. Thank you. Bye-bye.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference call. Once again, thanks, everyone, for joining us. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-02-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to Microchip’s Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Financial Results. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Microchip’s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip’s President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip’s Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip’s Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2022 financial performance, Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page for our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. Net sales in the December quarter were $1.76 billion, which was up 6.5% sequentially and up 30% compared to the December quarter of fiscal 2021. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 66.1% and operating income was a record 44.6%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $681.7 million. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6.7% in the December quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, was at the high end of our guidance and was a record $1.20. On a GAAP basis in the December quarter, gross margins were a record at 65.6% and include the impact of $8.4 million of share-based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $638.3 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $215.7 million, special income of $0.3 million, $3.2 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and share-based compensation of $42.5 million. GAAP net income was $52.8 million or $0.62 per diluted share and was negatively impacted by the GAAP loss on the convertible debt exchanges we executed in the quarter, which were not included in our guidance. Our December quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, most notably, the tax expense recorded from truing up estimated taxes to actual amounts based on tax returns filed during the quarter. Our inventory balance at December 31, 2021 was $768.2 million. We had 116 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, which was up 4 days from the prior quarter’s level. Our levels of raw materials and work in progress increased in the quarter, which helps position us for increased production we are expecting from our internal factories and helps buffer us against unexpected shortages or changes in material lead times. The days of inventory on our balance sheet go up with our gross margin improvement with each 100 basis points of gross margin improvement translating into approximately 2 to 3 days of increased inventory on our balance sheet. The carrying cost of our inventory has been and will be increasing due to rising input costs from our supply chain. We are continuing to ramp capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship as much product as possible to support customer requirements. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter was at 19 days, which is a record low level and in line with where it was at the end of the prior quarter. During the December 2021 quarter, we achieved a milestone of becoming an investment grade rated company. This is a goal we have been pursuing since we acquired Microsemi in May of 2018 and it positions us well for our capital return strategy that we detailed for investors at our Investor and Analyst Day back in November. In the December quarter, we exchanged a total of $96.2 million of principal value of 2025, 2027 and 2037 convertible subordinated notes for cash and shares of our common stock. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the principal amount of the convertible debt exchanges and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time. The principal amount of convertible debt on our balance sheet at December 31 was $903 million compared to $4.481 billion at the beginning of calendar 2020, putting our overall capital structure in a much better long-term position. During the December quarter, we also refinanced our revolving line of credit to be in line with our investment grade rating and decrease the size of that facility from $3.6 billion to $2.75 billion. Our cash flow from operating activities was a record $853.4 million in the December quarter. Our free cash flow was a record $762.7 million and 43.4% of net sales. As of December 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $315.5 million. We paid down $362.7 million of total debt in the December quarter. And over the last 14 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $4.8 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during the earlier years of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was a record $869.4 million and 49.5% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $3 billion and 46.5% of net sales. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.58 at December 31, 2021, down from 2.99 at September 30, 2021. Our dividend payment in the September quarter was $128.7 million and we repurchased $166 million of stock during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $90.7 million in the December quarter. Our expectation for the March 2022 quarter’s capital expenditures is between $135 million and $145 million. Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are expected to be between $390 million and $400 million. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 capital expenditures came in lower than originally planned due to longer equipment lead times and deliveries pushing out as a result of overall industry conditions. We continue to prudently add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected long-term growth of the business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $64.9 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the quarter, on the performance of the business as well as our guidance for the March quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Great. Thank you, Eric and good afternoon everyone. Our December quarter results continued the strength of strong growth quarters, with revenue growing 6.5% sequentially to achieve another all-time record at $1.76 billion, breaking through the $7 billion annualized revenue milestone. On a year-over-year basis, our December quarter revenue was up 30%, registering the fifth consecutive quarter of rising year-over-year revenue growth rate. Non-GAAP gross margin was another record at 66.1%, up 80 basis points from 65.3% in the September quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance as we continue to ramp our internal factories and benefit from improved fixed cost absorption as well as product mix changes. Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 44.6%, up 210 basis points from 42.5% in the September quarter and well above the high-end of our guidance. The large increase in operating margin percentage was helped by the rapid growth in revenue and the additional time it is taking to hire new employees, thus delaying expected operating expenses. At 21.5% operating expenses, we are 100 basis points below the low end of our long-term model of 22.5% to 23.5% in operating expenses. Our long-term business model will continue to guide our actions to enable the long-term growth and profitability of our business. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS was a record $1.20 per share at the high end of our guidance and up 49% from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA at 49.5% of revenue and free cash flow at 43.4% of revenue were both very strong, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation capabilities of our business. This in turn enabled us to pay down another $362.7 million in debt. It’s brought down our net debt by $422.1 million, driving our net leverage ratio down to 2.58% in the December quarter. This reduction in net debt and net leverage ratio was achieved despite our also buying back $166 million of our shares under our $4 billion stock buyback program, which we initiated soon after we achieved investment grade rating for our debt in November. The December quarter marked our 125th consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. And I would like to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team whose tireless efforts are what made these results possible. Taking a look at our revenue from a product line perspective, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up a strong 8.7% as compared to the September quarter and was an all-time record. On an annualized basis, our December quarter microcontroller revenue at $3.9 billion is closing in on $4 billion. On a year-over-year basis, our December quarter microcontroller revenue was up 33.9%. All microcontroller product lines, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit had over 30% year-over-year revenue growth in the December quarter, with 32-bit microcontrollers having the highest year-over-year growth. 8-bit microcontrollers and 32-bit microcontrollers, both of which are about the same size in revenue, each also achieved record revenue milestones. Microcontrollers represented 55.3% of our revenue in the December quarter. Coming off strong sequential growth in the September quarter, our analog revenue increased 1.9% in the December quarter, setting another record in the process. On an annualized basis, our December quarter analog revenue broke through the $2 billion mark for the first time. On a year-over-year basis, our December quarter analog revenue was up 34.3%, almost the same year-over-year growth rate as our microcontroller revenue. Analog represented 28.5% of our revenue in the December quarter. While we no longer breakout our FPGA or licensing revenue, they both remain a key focus for Microchip’s long-term growth. In the December quarter, our FPGA revenue hit an all-time record by a wide margin and our licensing royalty revenue also hit an all-time record. Taking a look at our revenue from a geographic and end market perspective, Americas was up 4.6% sequentially; Europe was up 11% sequentially, which is significantly better than typical seasonal performance for the December quarter; Asia was up 5.8% sequentially; and all end markets were strong and supply constrained. Business conditions continue to be exceptionally strong through the quarter. Our preferred supply program, or PSP backlog, continues to grow and is well over 50% of our aggregate backlog and 100% of our backlog in the most constrained capacity product areas. Demand far outpaced the capacity improvements and increased shipments we achieved in the quarter. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which represents backlog customers, wanted shipped to them in the December quarter, but which we could not deliver in the December quarter, continued to climb significantly as compared to the unsupported backlog exiting the September quarter. To illustrate the magnitude of the demand supply imbalance, despite our December quarter revenue, having grown 30% as compared to the year ago quarter, we exited the December quarter with the highest unsupported backlog ever. We continue to experience constraints in all our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. We are also experiencing some adverse impact from the rapid rise in the Omicron variant cases of the COVID-19 virus. We continue to ramp our internal factories as fast as possible and we are working closely with our supply chain partners who provide wafer foundry, assembly, test and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible. Looking at the magnitude of the demand supply imbalance, the size of our non-cancelable backlog and the rate at which we are able to bring on new capacity, we continue to expect that we will remain supply constrained throughout 2022 and possibly beyond that. We believe our backlog position, especially the proportion of PSP backlog, is giving us a solid foundation to prudently acquire constrained raw materials, invest in expanding factory capacity and hire employees to support our factory ramps. Our planned capital spending continues to rise in response to growth opportunities in our business as well as to fill gaps in the level of capacity investments being made by our outsourced manufacturing partners in technologies they consider to be trailing edge, but which we believe will be workhorse technologies for us for many years to come. In the December quarter, we have signed a definitive agreement to purchase an assembly test factory shell in the Philippines near where we already operate our manufacturing facilities. As we facilitize and build out this shell with equipment, we will be able to grow our internal back-end capacity for many years to come. We believe our increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, improve our gross margins, increase our market share and give us more control over our destiny, especially for trailing edge technologies. We will of course continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsourced partners. But our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities in areas where they don’t align with our business needs. Now, let’s get into the guidance for the March quarter. Our backlog for the March quarter is very strong and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. However, our supply in the March quarter is expected to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 Omicron variant, which has increased the level of factory workforce absentees. We also have challenges in staffing, several of our factories at the rate we would like to. Taking all these factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be up between 2% and 5% sequentially. Our guidance range assumes some capacity additions as well as continued capacity constraints, some of which we expect to work during the quarter and others that we will carryover to future quarters. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the March quarter would be a strong 24%. For the March quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 66.2% and 66.6% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 21.8% and 22.2%. And we expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 44% and 48% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.22 per share and $1.28 per share. Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. Finally, at our Investor Day on November 8 last year, we unveiled our Microchip 3.0 strategy, which builds on our Microchip 2.0 strategy that we successfully executed over the last decade, employing serial acquisitions to give us a solid foundation to build scale and breadth of solutions, while significantly improving our gross and operating margin model. To summarize, the essential elements of Microchip 3.0 we announced were an organic growth target of 2x the industry growth by focusing on total system solutions and the six key market megatrends. Long-term non-GAAP operating margin target of 44% to 46% and free cash flow target of 38%, increased capital return to shareholders to 50% of free cash flow and further increase this every quarter to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders as net leverage drops to 1.5x. Increased our CapEx investment to 3% to 6% of revenue and invest in 130 to 150 days of inventory over the business cycles. And finally, to maintain a strong company foundation built on culture and sustainability. As you can see from our December quarter results and the March quarter guidance, we are laser-focused on executing our Microchip 3.0 strategy. Let me now pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our capital return to shareholders. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our capital return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter in making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non-GAAP EPS and record cash flow from operations and record adjusted EBITDA. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 9.1% from last quarter to $0.253 per share. This is an increase of 29.7% from a year ago quarter. Last quarter, we received an investment-grade rating from both Moody’s and Fitch. After receiving such rating, we initiated our enhanced capital return strategy that we described at our Investor and Analyst Day on November 8, 2021. During the last quarter, we purchased $166 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $129 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return totaled $295 million. This was 50.1% of our free cash flow projection at the start of the quarter of $589 million, consistent with us targeting 50% of free cash flow as a return to our investors. However, our cash collections in the final month of the quarter were exceptional due to a very strong and linear shipping quarter and record non-GAAP gross and operating margins and record adjusted EBITDA being well above our forecast. Our actual free cash flow last quarter was $763 million, which was $174 million higher than our projection. Towards the end of the quarter, the stock buyback window had already closed. So we use the extra free cash flow towards further paying down the debt. This extra pay-down of debt as well as record adjusted EBITDA drove down our December net leverage to 2.58 from 2.99 at the end of September. Our strategy for cash return to the shareholders was to execute it based on forecast and then true up in the following quarter. Because of the unpredictability of the free cash flow, we are simplifying the process. Going forward, we will use the actual free cash flow for the prior quarter and return our target percentage of that free cash flow to shareholders in the current quarter. So based on this revised process, we will use our last quarter’s actual free cash flow of $763 million. This quarter, we plan to return 52.5% of this $763 million, which is $400 million to the shareholders. Out of this $400 million, the dividend is expected to be approximately $141 million and the stock buyback is expected to be approximately $259 million. I’d also like to note that on January 13, 2022, Moody’s further raised Microchip’s unsecured debt credit rating from prior BAA3+ to the current BAA2+. As you know, Moody’s BAA2 rating is equivalent to BBB on the rating scale of S&P and Fitch. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you.  We will take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask question. Just relative to the supply issues that you’re seeing in the March quarter, any way to quantify that? And as you think about the balance of the year, do you have enough visibility of backlog and scheduled supply growth to make the argument that you should be able to grow sequentially every quarter in the calendar year ‘22?
Ganesh Moorthy: So the supply issues in the March quarter are comprehended in our guidance. And so there is nothing more to say other than we are working through it. There are just natural issues that come with COVID and some of the disruptions that happened with it. Our backlog position, as I mentioned, is extremely strong. We have much of 2022 backlog already on the books. And really, it’s bringing supply on that we expect will continue to drive the growth. There is no shortage of demand that we’re working on. And every quarter, we continue to leave more of the backlog that is unsupported has happened five quarters in a row. So if you look at the size of the imbalance, the size of the non-cancelable backlog, the rate at which we’re bringing on new capacity, we expect we’re going to be constrained throughout 2022.
John Pitzer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Pradeep Ramani with UBS.
Pradeep Ramani: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to sort of follow-up on the prior question. In the past, you talked about visibility being solid for four quarters of sequential growth. How do we interpret your comments that you just made in terms of whether you have that visibility now, both in terms of demand and supply?
Ganesh Moorthy: We have visibility in terms of demand that exceeds four quarters. We have supply coming on every single quarter. We’re trying to guide you a quarter at a time. But at this point, there is no demand signal that has any concern for us. The PSP backlog makes it all non-cancelable. It’s a very high percentage of our backlog. Some of the PSP backlog is going well beyond 12 months at this point in time. So it’s really a supply-driven equation for at least all of 2022 and likely into 2023.
Pradeep Ramani: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Gary, we are unable to hear you. Please check your mute function.
Gary Mobley: Thanks for taking my question, guys. As your unsupported backlog continues to grow each and every quarter, I’m presuming that you’re having to make tough decisions with respect to supporting perhaps or not supporting some lower-margin products in the strategy for maximizing the mix and whatnot. Longer term, does that deferred product shipment going to backlog? Is it temporarily or permanently lost? What sort of – what are the sort of the long-term considerations in terms of mix contribution from the supply constrained environment that we’re in?
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, a constrained environment clearly gives us an opportunity to richen the mix and use the capacity we have. But you can’t just be short-term oriented in that. You have to look at who the customers are, what markets they are in, what the long-term prospects are that go with them. As demand goes unfulfilled in any quarter, it remains, for the most part, non-cancelable backlog. Anything in 90 days with or without PSP is already non-cancelable. And what we do is we just squeeze out some into the following quarters, some into the quarter after that. Capacity is coming on, and we’re able to respond to some of it with that. And they could be on the fringes, some of the demand that eventually does not materialize. But the vast majority of the backlog stays as non-cancelable backlog but serviced at a later point in time.
Eric Bjornholt: And the biggest decision maker now in terms of what we’re shipping is based on the PSP backlog that we’ve had in place and how long it’s been in place.
Steve Sanghi: Yes. I think your question was more like are we not shipping a low-margin backlog, and when we eventually ship is that a negative to gross margin. I think operations don’t know what the gross margin is. They look at units and backlog in dollars and they ship and allocate. So there is a much lower level of emphasis to not ship the low-margin backlog. It’s much more to do with who the customer is, what the market segment is, who the strategic accounts are we’re shipping the PSP backlog and constraining the non-PSP backlog. So I think your concern is really not well placed there.
Gary Mobley: Alright. Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. We will hear next from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to get your thoughts on industry supply/demand. Clearly, as of today and as you guys say, for the rest of the year, things most likely stay very tight. At the same time, you’re seeing pretty significant increases in CapEx from most players, including yourselves, your peers with capacity coming online late ‘22 and definitely into ‘23. Is it way too early to be concerned about supply/demand going into ‘23? Or how do you think about that internally? And what would you need to see for you to kind of pump the brakes on CapEx decisions? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: After five quarters and now into the sixth quarter, there is really no line of sight to having demand/supply coming back into some form of equilibrium. So we continue to – the gap between demand and supply, despite adding supply continues to grow. We know that’s not a permanent factor, but it is at this point in time. Demand continues to be strong. Every customer I speak to, every CEO that expresses their needs continues to see strength in their business. It’s, in fact, many, many of them wanting to go into something more of non-cancelable nature into ‘23, in many cases, into ‘24 as they see their business. So there are many, many factors driving semiconductor growth beyond the short-term supply/demand. There are secular factors that we’ve talked about with the megatrends, with how digitization is taking place. At some point, it will have a supply/demand balance that does occur. We don’t see it in ‘22. We don’t see it in our numbers that we see for ‘23 at this point.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. So Ganesh, I wanted to ask the supply-demand question in a different way. Can you increase supply every quarter for the next three or four quarters, obviously, barring any macro issues? Because if you can increase supply and demand, it’s not an issue, then growing sales every quarter should be doable, right or what part of that equation, right, am I missing?
Ganesh Moorthy: We are absolutely increasing capacity every single quarter. You’re not missing any part of that equation.
Vivek Arya: Got it. So that’s what I wanted to confirm because I thought there was some confusion that – are you still sticking with the potential for improving revenue every quarter, all else being equal?
Ganesh Moorthy: We’re driving in that direction. We’ve got plenty of demand. The demand side is not the issue, capacity is. We are building capacity that will continue to grow throughout 2022 and into 2023. We’re trying to provide you more general direction of where are we going without trying to make this every quarter what are we trying to do. Clearly, the guidance we’re providing specifically is for this quarter. But the demand-supply equation, driven by the demand we have, the supply we are bringing on, continues to have many quarters of legs.
Vivek Arya: Got it. Thank you, Ganesh.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid results and execution. Over the past earnings season, all three of the large U.S. based semi equipment suppliers have been coming up a bit short on shipments to their customers because they are being constrained by component availability, logistics and labor issues, and well, and they all expect to slightly under shift their customers’ manufacturing requirements, at least through the first half of this year. So I’m wondering if this is maybe slowing your ability to improve your internal front-end wafer capacity or even capacity plans by your outsourced wafer fab partners maybe just a little bit versus what you expected, maybe 60, 90 days ago?
Ganesh Moorthy: So it is true that equipment in general, and we’ve been saying this on prior calls as well, lead times have been stretching. Some part of that is just the equipment manufacturers’ imbalance between supply and demand. Some of it is semiconductor shortages that feed into the equipment that is built for semiconductor manufacturers. So yes, our lead times for receiving equipment have continued to stretch.
Harlan Sur: Thanks, Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.
Harsh Kumar: Hi, guys. A lot of people have asked about supply. I wanted to ask a question about demand. So this is the fifth or the sixth quarter, Steve and Ganesh, have exceptional demand. I understand at the beginning of the over time frame, there was some particular mismatch. But can you help us understand what is fundamentally going on with the end markets that this demand continues to strengthen? And now you are looking at a year’s worth of – years plus worth of non-cancelable orders, so help us with that, if you don’t mind?
Ganesh Moorthy: So demand in all geographies, in all end markets, continues to be strong. And I think they are driven by different requirements and at different times, right? If you take automotive, some of it was shortages. And then as they have tried to solve some of the shortages as content and there is a richening mix of the cars that is driving consumption of semiconductors. You take office automation. There was the return to – the work from home at first and now there is some amount of returning to the office and what needs to be done. So segment by segment by segment when you go into that, what we find is that the demand drivers, some of those or the mega trends we have talked about, some of that is still catch-up demand that people are trying to put in place. Demand continues to be extremely strong as reflected in the bookings we see, the backlog we have the period of time over which people are willing to place backlog and the percentage that they are willing to have is non-cancelable.
Harsh Kumar: Appreciate it, guys. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We will hear next from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the results. One of your competitors just had a call this morning, and they are talking about some pretty big CapEx numbers, basically regardless of the economic climate. I’m just wondering, philosophically, as you think about your capacity additions over the next few years, it does sound like the plans are a bit more measured. And then also the other CapEx number for fiscal ‘23. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: So we don’t have a CapEx for fiscal ‘23, if that was your question. We will share some of that when we have a May call itself. CapEx decisions are long-term decisions. They are not driven by just what does the next calendar year look like. It’s decisions about capacity that we want to be able to serve a 5, 10-year window of time as we look at it. And so perhaps, we have been more measured, and we do want to be thoughtful in what capacity and what capital are we bringing online, but we have also been aggressive over the last year. As you have seen in the level of capital expenses that we have put in, in the raising of the CapEx targets that we have had into capacity that we believe is long-term good capacity for Microchip to have both to be able to serve customers, but also to be able to replenish some of the inventory we think we need to as some level of normalization in demand and supply come about.
Tore Svanberg: Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: As Ganesh said, we’re not going to give you a fiscal ‘23 capital plan today. We will put that together as part of our annual operating plan process we go through this quarter. But I think investors should expect that given the environment that we are seeing, our intention to increase the percentage of manufacturing that we do internally, that CapEx will continue to be kind of on the high end of our guidance that we have given on a long-term basis next year, and we will give you a more firm number next quarter.
Tore Svanberg: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will hear next from William Stein with Truist Securities.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I will add my congratulations to the very strong execution. There is a comment in the press release that I don’t know if you have touched on during this discussion, I don’t quite understand. I certainly understand we are capacity constrained. Microchip is, the whole industry is, demand is very strong. Revenue is going up next quarter. I think the press release noted that inventory days you expect to increase next quarter. Is that for – are you building demand for product that has building inventory for product that has demand in future quarters, that’s just happened to not be required to be delivered during Q1, or is it WIP versus finished goods? Can you help me understand that? Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. I mean we are ramping our factories. We are seeing input costs increase to the supply chain and all those things are impacting our costs. And we demonstrated in our Analyst and Investor Day that we want to increase the days of inventory in the balance sheet to be able to better support customers. So raw materials, work in process is absolutely going up. Input costs continue to rise. And we are positioning ourselves to be able to continue to grow the business, as Ganesh has described before.
Ganesh Moorthy: If we can build it, we are shipping it. So, we are not trying to build inventory and hold shipments back. Clearly, there is more WIP, work in progress. There is more materials that we are going to need. We are in a growing environment. So, what we have to have internally is to be able to feed forward-looking demand, not just backward-looking demand.
Eric Bjornholt: Right. And also, as I mentioned in kind of my prepared remarks is as gross margin improves, that essentially increases the days of inventory on the balance sheet. It’s just the way the math works there.
William Stein: Yes. I understand. Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Chris Danely with Citi.
Chris Danely: Hi. Thanks guys. So, sequential revenue growth is slowing down a little bit easy that there is some Omicron issues and other hiring issues. Assuming that gets fixed in the March quarter, does that mean that revenue growth should accelerate in the June quarter? And will you be able to start to catch up and maybe try and reduce this unsupported backlog, if that happens?
Ganesh Moorthy: So Chris, the limitation is not on the demand side. It’s on the supply side. We are working on heck to address the supply constraints. COVID was an extra factor that we had not built into our plans. Obviously, no one knew about it until the December timeframe. We will hopefully clear through some of that going through this quarter. But there are also challenges on. Earlier on, we talked about getting equipment in on time has been a challenge. Hiring people has been a challenge. So, we are running like heck. We expect that the June quarter will have more favorable capabilities barring any unknowns in terms of where we might go.
Chris Danely: Okay. Thanks Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. We will hear next from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. My question is on pricing. And I know as input costs were rising last year, you were quick to pass along those price increases. I guess well, just three sub questions to that. One, do you believe that the price – the input price increases have – are behind us now, or is there potential for those to go higher as the year goes on? Are those price increases now fully baked into the quarterly results now that you are guiding for the March quarter? And then at what point do we start to kind of anniversary these price increases? And I am guessing you are not going to want to give us the magnitude of how much pricing has gone up. But at kind of what point does is that no longer a factor in year-on-year comps?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, let me try and parse your three questions and see how best to answer it. So firstly, input prices for us, our costs continue to go up. They are happening from different suppliers at different points in time with different magnitude. So, what you see reflected in our COGS, our days of inventory and all that is in fact, an aggregation of what is taking place every quarter. But our costs are going up and will continue to go up as we go through the year as that our structured cost increases built into 2022. For pricing, we have done them at specific points to try and not have a price increase every time there is a cost increase on us. That will also continue at some – as we collect cost increases that we have incurred and pass them on as price increases to a customer. Our intention is to be able to make sure that we are able to cover the increase that we have taken on. It’s hard to know in the current environment when does adjustment mechanisms that we have stopped. It’s an inflationary environment. We know that our suppliers are facing that inflation. They are passing on that inflation to us. There are large capital costs that they have incurred, the large capital costs we are incurring that are building into the cost structure. The labor costs have gone up quite significantly. The material costs have gone up quite significantly. And that hasn’t stemmed as of yet. And I don’t know if a year from now, we might be in better times from an inflationary standpoint. But as long as that inflation is there and cost increases are passed on to us, we will pass them on as price increases.
Chris Caso: Great. That’s all. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Alright. Thanks Chris.
Operator:  We will hear next from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about your customer level of inventory. I know we are dealing with the shortage situations, but it seems like in the past, we get into incomplete kitting where maybe you have inventory of other people’s components waiting for yours. Do you have any sense for that? And are you the bottleneck component in enough of these cases that you feel pretty confident that the inventory is as lean as it looks?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, we get inventory visibility through our channel, because they report that on a regular basis to us. To our OEM customers, we really don’t get – they don’t report to us. We might be able to look through their balance sheets as they report them and see what happen. But it’s really not specific to us. The intensity of customer escalations has not really backed off. Every single day, I am involved in half a dozen or more personally, which means that the rest of the company has an order or two magnitudes higher than that that are involved. And those are all the places where something that Microchip provides them is holding up that customer’s ability to complete what they are doing. Now we are, of course, aware of this, what has been termed the Golden Screw syndrome, where customers may be building inventory on product, they can get shipments off while they await shipments of the product that they need to complete the bill of materials. It’s reasonable to assume there is some part of that, that would apply to us as well. But given our 90-day non-cancelable terms for standard backlog at a minimum of 12 months of non-cancelable for PSP backlog, we believe there are significant disincentives for our customers to order meaningfully more than what they need.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you very much.
Ganesh Moorthy: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you. Ganesh, I had a question on OpEx. You mentioned that you are below the long-term target range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Should we expect OpEx then to catch up to the lower end, at least to the lower end of that range as we go through the next few quarters?
Ganesh Moorthy: It will go slowly. You can see we tapped it up in this quarter. Eric, maybe you want to talk a little bit more about kind of how the rate at which we would do that?
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. I think it’s very much dependent on our hiring success, right. I mean we are challenged in getting the labor that we need throughout the company. It’s just the market right now, and we are working hard with our HR teams to make that happen. So, I think it’s going to be a gradual increase, but the way we want you modeling long-term is within our long-term model, which is 22.5% to 23.5%, and we are below that this quarter.
Ganesh Moorthy: And there is wage inflation as well, which is higher than historical and we expect that will continue for some time.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will hear our next question from Christopher Rolland with SIG.
Christopher Rolland: Hey guys. Thanks for the question. And one for Ganesh or Steve. So, we are coming off of the TI update, and they are going to have somewhere between five to eight 300-millimeter fabs, which is pretty unbelievable. But do you guys were – and they are not the only adding 300-millimeter fabs. So, do you guys worry about a flood of kind of super efficient analog and embedded product hitting the market eventually here, I guess, first of all. And secondly, does this change your thinking about getting your own 300-millimeter fab to compete? Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: If you look over time, I mean capacity has come on at different points in the industry. At this point in time, we are not feeling a particular concern about 12-inch capacity and what it might do to our analog business. We do build some analog products through our foundry partners at our own 12-inch. A 12-inch fab at some point might be in Microchip’s future. It isn’t one that we are looking at today. And we will just have to evaluate where the situation is and what makes sense. But today, we are focused on the technologies that we build in-house, the work that we are doing to ensure that, that trailing-edge technology, which is really a limitation, not just in our growth, but actually part of the industry’s growth. There is not enough investment going in to those product lines that limit large end equipment. And we want to make sure that we have our capacity well lined up to participate in that growth and help our customers as well. Do you want to add anything else Steve?
Steve Sanghi: I would just add that based on what we know, the number of fabs being added by the company that you named, there is going to be a period of substantial underutilization and substantial underperformance and a significant headwind to the gross margin delivered by all that cost that they have to absorb. So, I think you are talking about very low cost capacity. I think I look at it just the opposite. I think there is going to be a significant cost problem for them. And not having all that 12-inch capacity, we are making enormous gross margins. Our operating margins are higher than our long-term target almost already, right?
Eric Bjornholt: It’s getting close to it.
Steve Sanghi: Yes, getting close to it. And we continue to make further improvements with bringing test inside. The technology we licensed last quarter, which we will be producing inside. So, we got plenty of buttons on ourselves to push, and I am really not concerned about somebody else’s capacity coming in. I recently learned of a report that there is $150 billion of investment that would be required to bring the trailing edge capacity online for the next 5 years. The capacity is that much short on the trailing edge. Why, because no foundry is putting additional trailing edge capacity. They are only putting leading edge. So trailing, it has to be done by whoever. And given that, there is not $150 billion of capital being put into trailing edge technology in the coming 5 years. So, I think I see this capacity to be short as far as we always can see right now.
Christopher Rolland: Thanks Steve.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research.
Nik Todorov: Yes. Thanks for giving the opportunity to ask the question. I have a little bit more philosophical question. How would you characterize the level of trust in the supply chain between suppliers, customers, the channel? Do you think there has been damage sustained? And given all the disruptions and what kind of impact is that potentially having?
Ganesh Moorthy: Trust is built over many, many years. It isn’t something that you either gain or lose in the course of a short period of time, which is what I would refer to the last 6 months, 12 months as. And trust is a function of communication, managing expectations, treating each other with respect. And all of those are consistent with how we work with our customers and we work with our suppliers and what we do. So no, I don’t think trust has been a thing. I think there is clearly stress points. People are looking to grow more. We are looking to grow more. We want more. Our customers are looking to grow more, they want more. But there is a realistic sense that we are doing the best that we can within the constraints that we have, just as our suppliers are working as best as they can within the constraints that they have. And we both share some responsibility in how we manage the path going forward. But so I don’t see any trust issues on either the customers side or the suppliers side that’s an issue.
Steve Sanghi: Well, it’s also a relative equation. If we were not shipping everything a customer needs, but they were getting all the products from our competitors whenever they are designed with our competitors, then it would be a problem, a bigger problem for us and losing trust because we are letting them down more than anybody else. But that’s not the case. It’s actually just the obvious opposite. Customer-after-customer, we are being told that despite the constraints, we have enabled their success in the last year, 2 years, more than the others have. Our constraints are – there are many competitors who won’t even take an escalation call. They would say, don’t bother us. There is nothing we can do. That’s all we can give you. And at Microchip, we are on numerous calls all day, every day of the week, and taking customers call, explaining them the situation, improving where we can, but giving shoulders – giving a shoulder to cry on for the customers. And that empathy is helpful. So, I think in general, we are building trust relative to our competitors in destroying trust.
Nik Todorov: Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our final question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.
Harsh Kumar: Yes. Hey guys. A tactical one here. Ganesh, I believe when you gave the commentary you may not have provided any color on how you expect these segments to perform in the March quarter. I was curious if you would take a second to just kind of give us whatever what’s the vision you can and how you expect the microcontroller analog business to perform in March?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, we don’t break out our product line for each quarter in terms of the guidance. They all work together on it. Right now, all of them are supply limited. All end markets are supply limited. It’s really how effectively we can bring capacity on, fight through some of the COVID issues and all of that. And the demand is there in all product lines, all end markets for what we need to do. And for the – for at least many more quarters, that’s really what determines what the strength is as seen in the product line or in an end market.
Eric Bjornholt: I think it’s probably helpful to look at that had a few quarters last calendar year where microcontroller analog outperformed each other. But overall, for the year, Ganesh gave year-over-year numbers. They really performed right in line with each other as the growth.
Ganesh Moorthy: It’s exactly the same.
Harsh Kumar: Got it. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Congrats.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude today’s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Moorthy for any additional or closing remarks.
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, thank you, everybody, for attending. We do have meetings and conferences and all that coming up in the next several weeks, and we look forward to speaking to you at soon. So, thank you. Good afternoon.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude today’s conference. We do thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2021-11-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Microchip Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Financial Results. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead.
Eric Bjornholt: Alright. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual event or results may differ materially.  We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. And in attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO, Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair, and Sajid Douty, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations who just joined us over the course of the last month.  I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2022, financial performance, Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results, discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.  We are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures, we have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results.  We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of our operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation, and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.  Net sales in the September quarter were $1.65 billion, which was up 5.1% sequentially, and up 26% compared to the September quarter of 2020. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography, as well as our total end-market demand on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 65.3% and operating income was a record 42.5%.  Non-GAAP net income was a record $605.6 million, our non-GAAP cash tax rate in the quarter was 6%, and Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share on a split adjusted basis exceeded the midpoint of our guidance, and were a record $1.07. This reflects our recent 2-for-1 stock split that was effective for stockholders of record on October 4th, 2021. On a GAAP basis in the September quarter, gross margins were a record at 64.8% and include the impact of $9.1 million of share-based compensation expense.  Total operating expenses were 652 million and include acquisition and tangible amortization of $215.7 million, special charges of $10.2, $2.8 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $46.6 million. GAAP net income was $242 million or $0.43 per diluted share. And was negatively impacted by the GAAP loss on the convertible debt exchanges that we executed in the quarter, which were not included in our guidance.  Our September quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, most notably the tax benefit recorded on the convertible debt exchange transactions that I just mentioned. Our inventory balance at September 30, 2021 was $713.6 million. We had 112 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, which was up one day from the prior quarter's level.  Our levels of raw materials and work in progress increased in the quarter, which helps position us for the increased production we're expecting from our internal factories. We're ramping capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship as much as possible to support customer requirements.  Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter was at 19 days, which is a record low level and down from 20 days as of the end of the prior quarter. In the September quarter, we exchanged a total of $263.6 million of our 2025, 2027 and 2037, convertible subordinated notes for cash and shares of our common stock. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the principal amount of the convertible debt exchanges.  And we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time. The principal amount of convertible debt on the Balance Sheet at September 30th was $999.2 million compared to $4.481 billion at the beginning of calendar year 2020, putting our overall capital structure and a much better long-term position.  Our cash flow from operating activities was $611.7 million in the September quarter. Our free cash flow was $533.2 million and 32.3% of net sales. As of September 30th, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $255.3 million. We paid down $415.6 million of total debt in the September quarter, and over the last 13 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down over 4.4 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt.  We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during much of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash-generation capabilities of our business, as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the September quarter was a record at $762.5 million or 46.2% of net sales.  Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $2.7 billion and 45% of net sales. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long - dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 2.99 at September 30th, 2021, down from 3.34 at June 30th, 2021.  Our dividend payment in the September quarter was a $121.2 million Capital expenditures were $78.5 million in the September quarter. Our expectation for the December 2021 quarter's capital expenditures is between $70 million and $90 million. Our capital expenditures for FY2022 are now expected to be between $350 million and $400 million.  As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 capital expenditures came in lower than originally planned due to longer equipment lead times and deliveries pushing as a result of overall industry conditions. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow, and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected growth of our business.  We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $43.7 million. And right now I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance in the business in the September quarter, as well as our guidance for the December quarter. Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our September quarter results continued to be strong, with the revenue growing 5.1% sequentially, to achieve another all-time record at $1.65 billion. September quarter revenue would've been even stronger, but for constraints due to some of our capacity improvements coming in later than we wanted. On a year-over-year basis, our September quarter revenue was up 26%.  Non-GAAP gross margin was another record of 65.3%, up 50 basis points from 64.8% in the June quarter, and above the high-end of our guidance as we continue to ramp our internal factories and benefit from improved fixed cost absorption, as well as product mix changes. Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 42.5%, up 80 basis points from 41.7% in the June quarter and above the high-end of our guidance.  Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was a split - adjusted record $1.07 per share and was up 37.6% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA at 46.2% of revenue and free cash flow at 32.3% of revenue were both very strong, continuing to demonstrate the robust profitability and cash generation capabilities of our business. This in turn, enabled us to pay down another $415.6 million in debt, and bring our net leverage ratio down to 2.99 in the September quarter.  With the progress we've already made and progress we expect to continue making in bringing down our debt and leverage ratio, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve an investment grade rating in the coming months. The September quarter marked a 124th consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability.  I would like to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results in the September quarter, and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team, whose tireless efforts not only delivered our strong financial results, but also supported our customers to navigate a difficult supply environment, and who work constructively with our supply chain partners to find creative solutions in an extremely constrained and challenging environment.  Taking a look at our revenue from a product line perspective, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially down 0.9%, as compared to the June quarter. In part, due to the very strong shipments in the June quarter, when this business was sequentially up 10.7%, and in part due to supply constraints in the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our September quarter microcontroller revenue was up 27.1% and microcontroller represented 54.2% of our revenue in the September quarter.  Our Analog revenue was sequentially up a strong 13.6% as compared to the June quarter, setting another record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, our September quarter analog revenue was up 35.8%. Analog represented 29.8% of our revenue in the September quarter. During the quarter, we completed our acquisition of our Iconic RF, a Belfast, Northern Ireland based small early-stage private Company.  Iconic RF makes innovative high-performance gallium nitride and gallium arsenide monolithic microwave integrated circuits focus on the aerospace and defense market. And we believe will further strengthen our position in this market. Revenue contribution from Iconic RF is not material. The purchase price was in the mid-single-digit million ranges with possible future performance-based earn-outs.  This acquisition is akin to acquiring intellectual property along with domain experts to help us accelerate our business agenda in specific laser-focused areas. Taking a look at our revenue from a geographic and end-market perspective, Americas was up 12.5% sequentially, Europe was up 4.8% sequentially, which is better than typical seasonal performance for a September quarter. Asia was up 2.1% sequentially.  All end-markets were strong and supply-constraint. Business conditions continue to be exceptionally strong through the quarter, with record bookings and backlog s for products to be shipped over multiple quarters. Our Preferred Supply Program, or PSP, continues to grow and be over 50% of our aggregate backlog, and 100% of our backlog in the most constrained capacity product areas.  Demand far outpaced the capacity improvements and increased shipments we achieved in the quarter. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which customers wanted, shipped in the September quarter, but of which we could not deliver in the September quarter, continued to climb significantly as compared to the prior quarter's level.  This is the fifth consecutive quarter that our unsupported backlog for product requested in a given quarter has grown, despite our quarterly revenue having grown 26% in the September '21 quarter, as compared to the year-ago quarter. We continue to experience constraints in all of our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains.  During the September quarter, we experienced, and were adversely impacted, by COVID -related disruptions in our packaging and testing operations in Asia. As the Delta variant adversely impacted many of these countries. We took additional steps to protect our employees in these countries and worked with our partners as they took mitigation steps.  We also worked closely with our supply chain partners who provide wafer foundry, assembly, test and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible. It is a challenging environment for our factories and our partner's factories to hire, train, and retain employees to support the planned manufacturing ramps.  Despite all this, through all the actions we have taken to increase capacity, we expect we will be in a position to support revenue growth for at least each of the next four quarters. This extends by one more quarter, what we stated in our August conference call, as our September quarter results are now behind us. We now expect that manufacturing constraints will persist through much of 2022 and possibly beyond that.  We believe our backlog position, especially the proportion of PSP backlog, is giving us a solid foundation to prudently acquire constrained raw materials, invest in expanding our factory capacity, and hire employees to support our factory ramps. Our capital spending plans are rising in response to growth opportunities in our business, as well as to fill gaps in the level of capacity investments being made by our outsourced manufacturing partners in technologies.  They may consider being trailing edge, but which we believe will be workhorse technologies for us for many years to come. In the September quarter, we were able to secure a license from one of our wafer manufacturing partners for a key trailing edge technology that runs on 8-inch wafers, which we expect to have qualified and in production by 2023. This licensed technology is still growing for us and we expect it will be a workhorse technology for at least 10 to 15 more years.  We believe our increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, improve our gross margins, increase our market share, and give us more control over our destiny for trailing edge technologies. We will of course, continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsourced partners. But our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities in areas where they don't align with our business needs.  Now let's get into the guidance for the December quarter. Our backlog for the December quarter is very strong and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the December quarter to be up between 4% and 8% sequentially, much stronger than normal seasonality, which is usually down 2% for the December quarter.  Our guidance range assumes capacity additions, as well as continued capacity constraints, some of which we expect to work through during the quarter, and others that will carry over to be worked in future quarters. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the December quarter will be a strong 29.3%, Accelerating from the 26% year-over-year growth in the September quarter, 19.8% year-over-year growth in the June quarter, and 10.6% year-over-year growth in the March quarter.  For the December quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 65.8% and 66.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 22.3% and 22.7% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 43.1% and 43.9% of sales, and we expect our split adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings-per-share to be between a $1.14 per share and a $1.20 per share.  Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis, except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis.  We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters. And we requested analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. Finally, as previously announced, we will be holding our Investor and Analyst Day on November 8th and New York, which will also be simultaneously webcast for those who cannot attend in person.  At the event, we will be providing details about our long-term expected growth rate, updated gross and operating margin targets, as well as more specifics about our strategy for capital return, revenue growth, and manufacturing. We hope you will be able to join us for this important and informative event. Let me now pass the baton to Steve, to talk about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh. And good afternoon everyone. Today I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter and making new records in many respects.  Namely: 1. record net sales, 2. record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, 3. record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, 4. record cash flow from operations and 5. record adjusted EBITDA. Reflecting on our journey of debt and leverage ratio since the acquisition of Microsemi, three-plus years ago. I note the following.  First, we financed the micro semi -acquisition by adding $8.1 billion of debt, which increased our net leverage ratio in the June 2018 quarter to 4.95, which we know was a concern for many of you. In the last three plus years, we have paid down a cumulative $4.4 billion of debt and brought our net leverage ratio down to 2.99. The allocated substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond what we paid to shareholders in dividends to pay down significant debt every quarter.  Number two, within the last 6 months, based on the debt pay down and the continued strong cash and our Adjusted EBITDA generation of our business, both Moody's and Fitch changed their rating outlook from stable to a positive outlook. And now last quarter with very strong debt pay-down and getting to a leverage ratio of below 3.0, we believe we will receive an investment-grade rating in the coming months.  Regarding our capital return strategy, we're continuing to provide more cash return to the shareholders. Just today, we announced a dividend of $0.232 per share. Our dividend is reflective of Microchip's 2for1 stock split that was effective last month. This is our fourth consecutive quarter with a large dividend increase, increasing the dividend by 6.2% sequentially, and 25.9% over a year-ago quarter.  And in the coming quarters, we expect to continue with more actions to increase the cash returned to shareholders. We plan to give you more information about our capital return strategy, next week at our Investor and Analyst Day. We hope to see you all there. With that Operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: Thank you. . We'll pause just a moment to let everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. We'll take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. And congratulations on the solid results. Ganesh, I wanted to get into a little more detail about the difference between your microcontroller business being down sequentially and analog being up. It's -- your down is a lot less than TI s, and your up is a lot more than TI s, but it's the same dynamic that they saw in their September quarter.  And they highlighted the fact that perhaps, customers were requesting less expedited orders, that there was a little bit of a cooling off. I'm just curious when you look at that gap, what was the big driver in the quarter? And as you look at the December guide, would you expect the microcontroller business to start to show some accelerating growth?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's a great question. I think they are just quarter-to-quarter timing, if you look at our June quarter results, microcontrollers were super strong in that quarter. We had more constraints that hit the microcontroller business in the September quarter. I wouldn't look at anything  I don't want to one-quarter basis.  Businesses, microcontroller as well as Analog are doing extremely well and I expect both of them will have nice growth as we go through the December quarter. There is no customer slowdown on one product line and the other product line. They're all constrained, they all have a substantial unsupported exiting the quarters.
John Pitzer: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Gary Mobley: Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I look forward to catching up with everybody next week. I wanted to ask about the backlog, and your ability to fill that backlog over the next 4 consecutive quarters. I appreciate your commentary about how the capital equipment you plan intend to put in place is supportive of four quarters of sequential revenue growth.  But what is the risk of not receiving the capital equipment because of long lead times, or lead times, or the inability to get desired capacity from partners, And is this roughly 6% sequential revenue growth, supported by more capacity, indicative of how you see it, unwinding for those remaining three quarters or so?
Ganesh Moorthy: So firstly, the 6% growth is a December quarter midpoint of guidance that we have. We're not making predictions for quarters beyond the December quarter. What we do see is enough capacity coming online. We have line of sight to what we're doing internally. We have line of sight to what we are working with our partners, so that we expect that every quarter, for the next four quarters, including December in it, we’ll have the opportunity for supply side growth.  And right now, there's enough and more demand for all those quarters. It's really a matter of bringing their supply on and we don't see any major risks and being able to bring capacity on. There's always timing of pieces of equipment for a given factory, but that all comprehended in the way we're thinking about it. As we have gone along through this year, almost every month, we've been able to bring on something incremental in the capacity, which is why you've seen every quarter we've been able to show sequential growth in each of the quarters.
Gary Mobley: Appreciate that color Ganesh, with the ability to supply being the main strength of revenue, is it fair to say that over the next four quarters it's going to be hard to build distributor inventory anywhere above the 20-day level roughly where it's at today?
Ganesh Moorthy: We don't know. We expect that it's going to be difficult just judging by what we see as the intensity of the demand, what we see as a sell-through, and what's going on. But it's hard to tell what exactly distributions in the inventory will be that far out in time. I don't know Eric, if you have any more insight?
Eric Bjornholt: I really don't. I mean, just -- and Ganesh mentioned that earlier, but our unsupported backlog, that's -- it's both split between direct and distribution. So distributors would love to have more products and we're just not able to supply at this point in time. So I think it will be challenging, but it's hard to predict.
Gary Mobley: Appreciate it, guys. Thanks.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities, please go ahead.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. There is some debate whether the preferred supplier programs or some of your peers, you call them antsy on our programs, are they ready enforceable or dependable? Because some of your competitors have chosen not to use them as much. So I'm just curious to get your perspective, why there is so much debate on use of these programs?  What is their enforceability and dependability because ultimately your products are going in end markets that need products from your competitors as well, so those markets are not doing as well, then how enforceable are your contracts? How should we think about the fact you have this PSP backlog as to how dependable the forward outlook is. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Firstly, I don't know all the different programs different people have and so I won't try to contrast with what we're doing. What we know in talking too many of our key customers, who really by the way drove how we designed and implemented this system, the PSP program, is that it is 1. Seen as highly valuable, 2. That it has grown over time, and 3. It continues to not only be strong, but people want to extend that PSP outlook.  We have 12 months as our standard backlog requirement for it. There are people placing beyond 12 months, honest. And I think everybody is recognizing that the semiconductor content and the products that they are making are extremely important to their achieving the innovation in their products, their growth objectives, and therefore are much more in the mode of making sure that they have that thought through in the demand they place on us.  And because it is non - cancellable, I also expect, and I believe every one of them is putting thought into where to have PSP backlog and where not to have PSP backlog, given by the strength of their business and the views they have for their growth.
Vivek Arya: Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Tore Svanberg: Congratulations on the solid results. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the end markets, especially in relation to delinquencies. Are there any areas where the delinquencies are more or less?
Gary Mobley: It's hard to find one where there is no delinquency at this point. If I judged by the number of customer escalations I get involved in calls that I have to be able to respond to, it's an every segment. Clearly, what the news plays out has a -- got a higher component of automotive.
Ganesh Moorthy: But it's absolutely not the only place where there are constraints. Constraints on an industrial  communications infrastructure and data center in the home appliances and even in parts of defense and aerospace. And so all end markets are finding that there is needs and there is demand and excess of what they had thought of a year ago. And we see these constraints in all end markets.
Steve Sanghi: I would like to add that automotive tends to have the largest megaphone, so they make the most noise. People think that the constraints are the biggest in automotive. That is definitely not true. We're seeing similar constraints in the industrial market and consumer markets and other places, but just automotive gets talked about more.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Prajib Rahmani with UBS, please go ahead.
Prajib Rahmani: Hi, congratulations, great quarter. Thanks for taking my question. I had a little bit more of a longer-term question. I guess, a lead time for at least the 32-bit MCU seem to be still stretching and they’re well beyond 22 weeks is what I'm hearing.  But if you look into 2022, how would you sort of paint the picture for investors around where -- I mean, where lead times had to buy, say, mid-2022? Do you get a sense that in the current market scenario that lead times might not compress much at all in 2022, or can you help us gauge that a little bit more?
Ganesh Moorthy: There are two sides of that equation. There's one side of that equation which is supply, and the other side of that equation is demand. If you look a year ago where we were, to where we are today, despite having brought significant supply online, we are farther behind in terms of the constraint or the unsupported that we have. And that's because demand grew even faster than the supply did.  I don't know how 2022 is demand picture, and we have a good sense of our own supply and what we're doing. But how the demand picture will change and when that will change, I don't know. But at this point in time, if you judge by how much unsupported did we have every quarter, exiting each quarter, we've had five quarters in a row where we produced more, but had more unsupported exiting the quarter. And I am fully expecting that exiting December, it will be the 6th consecutive quarter where that's going to happen.
Prajib Rahmani: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much, guys. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a little bit about the pricing environment and that's been topical given the big supply-demand imbalance in the industry. Ganesh, maybe you could talk a little bit about the comments that you made about having support for growth over the next four quarters from here.  How much of that is based on supply coming online and how much of that is based on, I guess, better pricing or passing through higher input costs in terms of pricing? And whatever pricing you're putting in place right now, how durable do you feel that is as supply and demand may be converged down the line? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: So it's a multi-variable equation. It's hard to break out exactly what is from price and what is from capacity. We do have -- clearly what we're doing on the capacity side of adding more wafers to be able to run either in our fabs and our partner’s fabs, adding more assembly and test capacity, and so there is a significant amount of unit growth that we're expecting going into 2022 and into 2023.  The pricing for us is largely to be able to pass along cost increases that we're seeing, and to make sure that -- we usually will bunch them rather than try to do it on a regular basis. And -- so we wait to see how cost increases are coming into us, bunch of together at some point in time, and then pass on the price increase. But the exact mix of car -- or price increase versus unit thing I don't have, there is a significant amount of unit growth going into next year.  As far as what happens far down time, I don't get the sense that input costs are going down and that pricing has to come down out in time. Things like the labor costs that have been going up, those are in -- they're not coming back down. A lot of the costs for material and equipment are requiring companies, not just us, but even our supply chain, to have significant capital spending to be able to not just expand factories, but build brand-new factories.  And the cost structure when you are involved there are quite significant as well. So it is my belief that these price increases are here to stay. and at least to stay for a fair amount of time into '22 and '23.
Matt Ramsay: Very clear. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan, please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid results and execution. Macro trends in China have been somewhat mixed, obviously, building in construction activity has been muted. Industrial activity seems to be relatively okay.  Consumer is mixed and the team has really great real-time visibility on the end markets in China. Have you guys seen any slight inflections in China demand or is the supply demand gap just so wide that they're not able to provide enough supply even if things have down-shifted a bit?
Ganesh Moorthy: You know, it's a little early to put all that together. Some of the power changes were really in the late September time frame. The effects of Evergrande or any of the other ones when it percolates down to the rest of the chain that's involved there takes some time. There is no discernible end market color we have to provide on China. We continue to have enough demand and excess of supply that even if some of that demand were to soften, we still have a lot of unsupported demand for China today.
Harlan Sur: Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  We'll take our next question from William Stein with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
William Stein: Great. Thank you for taking my question and I'll add my congratulations, especially on the outlook. One of the great things that Microchip's done over time is that you were very early on to recognize that similar to the industrial -- industrial companies, acquisitions in semi's could provide great opportunities for both cost synergies, but also revenue synergies.  I'm hoping you might use this time to update us on your integration of Microsemi. It's been a couple of years, and I wonder if the current strong environment has either delayed or accelerated the synergies. Is there a lot more to go that maybe we all forgot about because demand has been so good? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: The integration of Microsemi is substantially complete. There are some small amounts on the business systems, and maybe I'll let Eric speak to it.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. So I mean, there's still some business system integration to go I would say from a cost perspective or synergy perspective that's relatively small. The things that we continue to work on which are ongoing stories are going to be TSS, or Total System Solutions, for the products that we've acquired from Microsemi, and the sales and business units are working very hard on that and we're getting good traction.  And the other piece is ongoing manufacturing integration, which just takes time. And some of that is bringing more assembly and test in-house. And some of that will be looking at some of the smaller factories over time and how that can play out to bring some cost improvements to us over multiple years. But other than that, most of the benefit is in the P&L already.
Ganesh Moorthy: And Steve may want to speak to -- we, last quarter, shared with you where we were from a combined Company earnings-per-share versus what we had set 3 years ago. So, maybe Steve, you want to speak to that?
Steve Sanghi: So, if you recall, back in May-June of 2018, when we acquired Microsemi, we've guided to a run-rate earnings per share of $2 per share, three-years out. So now we are three-years out -- there's three years and one quarter, and we just announced to earnings of dollars 7, which is splitter, just $2 to $2.14 pre-split, versus a $2 guidance we had given as a target 3 years ago.  So we essentially have completely delivered on that promise in the middle of substantial issues for our most of that period, including an inventory correction in the late 2018, followed by U.S.-China trade tensions which affected our industrial business, consumer business, and others, followed by 2020, the year of COVID, which also created a lot of issues and all the COVID constraints, some of them are continuing. Followed by a strong demand cycle that we're seeing right now. So a combination of all these things, we still have delivered on that Permian --
Ganesh Moorthy: Plus the Huawei ban and various other --
Steve Sanghi: Huawei ban and many other smaller companies that have been banned from being shipped too.
Ganesh Moorthy: So it's done outstanding for us and I think all the results we had hoped for and more have been delivered.
William Stein: Yup, thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question -- excuse me. We'll take our next question from Chris Danely with Citi. Please go ahead.
Chris Danely: Hey, thanks, guys. Just wondering about your lead times. How do you think your lead times compare versus the competitors? And does the difference in lead times, does that drive any share shifts? Do you think it will drive any share shifts?
Steve Sanghi: So Chris, I think lead time is not one number for the Company, across our 100,000 plus skills, we have products that are available in 4 weeks, and there are products that are not even available in 52 weeks. So, people talk about an average lead time terms. But I don't think it's fairly very meaningful. It's like putting one foot in icy water and another foot in boiling water, and creating the average and think a percentage is comfortable.  We have lots and lots of products where the product is available earlier, but we have lots and lots of products which are not available even in a year. We do not know the lead time of every single competitor on every single part, because their situation is similar where the lead times are different across products.  But given all that, I think when you look at the totality of results, our year-over-year growth compared to many of our competitors, and our last quarter and the current quarter guidance, it clearly shows we are gaining share. I think that we can see. Now, do we have customers from other companies were not able to get products coming to us for help? Yes, lots and lots of them. Are we able to help them all? No, but we're able to help some of them or many of them.  You could also have a situation where somebody who is not able to get product from us, seeking product from one of our competitors. That's only natural, and I'm sure they are able to help some of them, if they happen to have a product which is available in shorter lead time. But when you take all the puts and takes, you got to, at the end of the day, look at the overall growth where we're exceeding what we're seeing from the competition, especially in the two markets of microcontrollers and Analog and we're gaining share in both.
Ganesh Moorthy: Of course, as we win those customers coming over to us because we are able to help them, we're also getting long-term commitments from them to stay with Microchip beyond the cycle.
Chris Danely: Yeah. Thanks, guys. That's very helpful.
Steve Sanghi: Thanks.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about PSP. Is there a skill or are there any patterns by device type or end market? Is the uptake of PSP stronger? For example, MCU s versus Analog versus FPGA or by end market. And I guess more importantly, customers who aren't signing up -- who are not signing up for PSP. What's typically the reason or the rationale that pretty much just wanting the flexibility, or is it something around pricing? Just curious why some customers opt to not sign up. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: The PSP by product line isn't particularly different. By end market, certainly that our end markets with more demand certainty, more demand durability. There are certain customers who have more financial capability to go behind the commitments that they are making with PSP. And those customers, and that end -- those end markets do have a higher proportion of the PSP backlog that we have.  What a given customers rationale for not doing it can be any number of things. Either the markets or the financial strength could also be their view of, do they or don't they need to be in the program? I can tell you that everybody who has signed up a PSP is getting priority and is seeing results that are to their benefit in a highly constrained environment where demand far exceeds supply. And we're leaving unsupported, going out of every quarter.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: You're welcome.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you very much. Ganesh I'm going to put my lack of knowledge on full display here on the unsupported backlog. So there's an -- all is well concerned when lead times get stressed out and we're in such a tight environment for so long. So you're referring to the unsupported backlog as one of the reasons why you say your visibility is so high. Is this included in your book-to-bill? Is this noncancellable? Why is that the right metric to look at? Could you please explain?
Ganesh Moorthy: Let me separate two different things for you. We have backlog over multiple quarters. Orders placed on us and they can be asked for delivery in March and June, this quarter, etc. Unsupported that I'm referring to is what was requested in a given quarter that we could not ship. Meaning if we could ship at all, that would have added to the revenue within the quarter.  That's what we said at a record level, exiting September, and actually has been growing for 5 quarters at this point in time. And I expect it will be at another record level, exiting the December quarter. So unsupported just represents the current quarter of backlog that somebody would like to have shipped to them, but which we are unable to ship to them. So you can see what we report, our revenue which is what we actually shipped, what you don't see is what people wanted in the quarter that we could not ship.  And then the back -- that continues to remain as backlog that ships into whenever it is that we can ship. And then there's other backlog which is in addition to that, that goes all the way to 1 and 2 years depending on what program customers are on. Does that make sense?
Ambrish Srivastava: But there's no -- it does, that's helpful, but there's no noncancellable term to this, right? It's just what's you could not fulfill. So it could be canceled down the road, just like any other backlog which is where multiple quarters, right?
Ganesh Moorthy: Our standard non - cancelable window is 90 days. Almost by definition, if somebody was asking for product in this quarter that we could not fulfill, it is all non - cancelable. PSP adds a second dimension of 12 months of non - cancelable on a rolling basis that customers would have. PSP backlog, which is significantly over 50%, is all 12 months of non - cancelable. Plus, anything non - PSP, in the next three months, is also non - cancelable.
Ambrish Srivastava: Got it.
Eric Bjornholt: Maybe just to make --
Ambrish Srivastava: That's helpful.
Eric Bjornholt: To make sure this is clear, the unsupported backlog is both PSP backlog and non - PSP backlog. So, there's a lot of unsupported that is in the PSP program. We just can't meet the commitment. The requested committed 
Ambrish Srivastava: ,
Steve Sanghi:  Ambrish is that, we don't even have enough supply to meet all the PSP needs. There is a sufficiently even PSP backlog, which is unsupported in the current quarter. And we'll continue to be unsupported for several quarters, will ship the last quarter and supported this quarter.  But some of the current quarter backlog will not be supported this quarter we will support our next quarter. So some of the capacity quoted doors, byproduct, by technology, by fab are so constrained that PSP backlog is over 100% of that capacity.
Ambrish Srivastava: Got it.
Steve Sanghi: And that is noncancellable over the next 12 months.
Ambrish Srivastava: Appreciate you for taking the time to explain it. Thank you.
Operator: Okay. We'll go next to Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good evening. Two quick questions on pricing. And first, a clarification on the PSP program. And when the customer places the order on the PSP program, is there a firm pricing commitment with that order such that to protect it against further price increases? And if so, does that create a risk for you if your input costs increase over the next year when that product is on the books?  And then just longer-term, do you feel that there is a structural element to these input cost increases? The fear is that 1 point demand will eventually slow and will catch up with supply and demand and costs will start to come down again. Do you feel that's not likely to happen and if so why?
Ganesh Moorthy: To your first question. The PSP program is a priority for delivery, has nothing to do with pricing. Pricing is what we would need to make adjustments to, when there are reasons to make those adjustments based on input costs going up. So there is no guarantee of fixed pricing being part of the PSP program. On your second question with respect to input costs, there are certain input costs which are structurally in, for example, labor costs that go in.  Now, perhaps in time as factories scale and size, they would get amortized over more units. But right now, labor cost is going up. And you don't take labor costs down when the cycle begins to change, that our material costs and maybe some of the material costs could be more driven by with the cost of the commodity involved, topper, etc., are going to be and we don't know how those will change.  And then there are equipment costs as we buy them, we're we have in the past, to grow our capacity, typically been buying used equipment at discounted prices. In the current environment, where all fabs are full, all capacity is full, that is not available option to us. We are paying more expensive, or buying more expensive equipment to be able to outfit the capacity growth that we need.  And that will of course stay in structurally as well. But scale will help with some of that costs and how it gets amortized. But I don't fundamentally think pricing is going to change given all these moving parts and that's the general sense I get from all of our supply chain partners and how they're thinking about it, and what the input variables are to them as they look at what pricing they're going to be doing.
Eric Bjornholt: So Matt, maybe I can -- expand a little bit on Ganesh 's first point on pricing, just to explain how it works. So if we have a price increase, the customer has 5 days once that price increase goes out to make the decision, do they want to accept that price increase or not? And if they don't accept the price increase that comes back to Microchip and does Microchip choose to ship it at a lower price, or do we reallocate that capacity when there's so much capacity on the books when customers are screaming for product to another customer.  And what we've seen, what we've had price increases, is that there has been hardly any consumers that cancel their orders or choose not to accept the price increase because they understand the situation on the supply side.
Chris Caso: Very interesting. Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: We will take our next question from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Christopher Rolland: Hey, guys. Just following up on that as well. And Ganesh, you may have already answered this, but we are hearing about pricing increases from a bunch of your competitors across microcontroller and Analog. And some of this is input costs, but some of this is also opportunistic. So I guess my first question is, how you guys feel about that and whether you have a plan around pricing moving forward.  And then Steve, I always love your big picture thoughts. And so, as it relates to pricing, the more pricing power that's enacted here, when this all ends, does this pricing revert or is there something structural and you think it might be stickier this cycle versus other cycles, given that there are fewer competitors out there than in past decades?
Ganesh Moorthy: Okay, I'm trying remembering, what was the first part of the question again?
Christopher Rolland: That first part is pricing increases from your competitors. Do you guys have a plan there, and then thoughts on a bigger picture on pricing and sticking.
Ganesh Moorthy: We view pricing as a strategic exercise, not a tactical exercise. We don't subscribe to trying to raise prices just because we can. These are proprietary products. Our customers entrusting us to be able to make their designs 2 years before they go to production. And they need to have the understanding that pricing will be thought of in a long-term perspective. And so we do the changes this year or we did the changes this year only because of the significant increase in input costs.  But on an ongoing basis, we do not view pricing as something to tactically go changes, not a commodity product like memory products might be. These are proprietary products with strategic engagements and long-term relationships with customers, and their trust that we expect to be able to maintain. Let Steve answer the second half.
Steve Sanghi: So, my feeling is that the pricing, wherever the pricing has increased, I do not see that pricing coming down longer term on the proprietary products. On some of the commodity products, if there is a lot of supply becomes available and there is a competition that is able to ship DRAM, or a flash, or NAND.  Those pricing may come down, but I don't see pricing on our microcontroller products or analog products, connectivity products, 98% of what we make is largely proprietary, those prices to come down, because when you look at the components of the pricing, the -- I don't see that fabs are going to lower the wafer cost, outside, because they're making huge investments because of shortage and that equipment is being placed in -- now.  And what would be the reason to lower the price later? The -- if the commodity prices come down, there is a small component of the overall costs where that will come down. And as Ganesh mentioned earlier, the label cross-sell are not likely to come down. The assembly test costs are not likely to come down. Our internal fabrication and other costs are not going to come down.  We're paying more for the equipment and that structurally stays in the cost structure. So I don't really see that the price increases that were passing onto their customers are temporary in nature, nor are we giving that kind of impression to our customers. I think they're largely there to stay. Could there be a minor adjustment here and there if there was a significant cost downwards from the input cost perspective? Then it's possible, but I don't really see it.
Christopher Rolland: Helpful answers. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Thanks for letting me ask a follow up. The gross margin expansion has been very impressive. And I know you'll be providing your long-term margin target next week, but more near-term. If I look at the December quarter guide and the last 3 reported quarters, you guys ' incremental gross margins are in a pretty tight range, right?  74% to 77% fall through very strong, very predictable, given that you're at full utilizations and will be so at least through most of next year, is this how we should think about the gross margin expansion on incremental revenue growth kind of near-term, around 75% fall-through?
Eric Bjornholt: Yeah, we're whenever really comfortable providing that metric. Where it's a complex equation with many, many factories, and lots of input cost changes and whatnot, labor costs increases. We are being as efficient as we can. Obviously PSP backlog, having so many backlogs in place allows our factories to be efficient and what they're doing.  And we do expect gross margin to continue to rise, but don't want to take away from our messaging that we're going to give at the Investor Day next week on gross, on what, the gross margin target is going to be?
Ganesh Moorthy: We also have outside manufacturing, right? So it does not have some of the same factory benefits as when we do it inside. So there are a lot of different pieces of this puzzle. And so, I would not draw a straight line through whatever equation that you had for the last 3 or 4 quarters.  I think there are many more puts and takes that will give you more guidance on kind of how we see things for the longer term. But we have had good success in the last 3, 4 quarters that you've seen in the results we posted.
Steve Sanghi: And even the insight factories, the gross margin goes up -- incremental gross margin is much higher when you're going from under-utilized factories to full utilization. Once you're at full utilization, and you're adding capital which you are adding depreciation, then you're shipping that product, the incremental gross margin is not as high as you would think. Remember, we also ship first-in, first-out.  So even when the factory becomes full, under-utilization goes away, you're still shipping product which you built earlier, when the utilize -- the increasing capital wasn't added. Now we're adding incremental capital to grow the capacity and that depreciation comes in.  Therefore, the incremental gross margin is better than the average because you're utilizing the factory better, the management, fixed infrastructure, the ecosystem the water, they air, everything else; you are using it more efficiently. So there is incremental gross margin, which is higher than corporate. But your metric of what it has been in the last four quarters may not stay.
Christopher Rolland: Perfect. Okay. Looking forward to next week. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David O'Connor with Exane. Please go ahead.
David O’Connor: Great. Good afternoon and thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe just one follow-up, Ganesh, to your comment earlier in your prepared remarks about a license for wafer manufacturing technology on an 8-inch. And what was the just wondering what  for that what you need to take that .  Was it some large design win or was there some change in the technology road map that requires this or even anything around the end market, where that is going and how significant it could be? That would be helpful. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: It's an 8-inch trailing edge technology that we see having lots of legs for many years in key end markets and with key customers that the products are built on. The appetite to invest, there are the priority invest there did not rise to the level to make that investment from our partners.  And so we worked to get it licensed and to be able to do it ourselves, very consistent with what we said last time and this time, that we will be increasing our capacity investments in trailing edge technologies, where our partners do not see the same opportunity to invest. But we see that opportunity and priority for what we do. So that's all that it represents.
David O’Connor: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nick Todoros with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
David O’Connor: Good afternoon, everyone, and congrats on the results. Ganesh, your comment that the growth and unsupported backlog, I think it implies that your bookings continue to accelerate or at least they're outgrowing your billings. A, is that correct?  And B, if that's the case, why do you think you continue to see such acceleration or outgrowth in your bookings, and is that implied that you're seeing increasing number of expedites because I'm assuming that also ties up to how many -- how much broader customers are asking for the current quarter.
Ganesh Moorthy: You have a number of questions on what you asked and not all of them necessarily are linked. So first of all, bookings have been strong, remains strong, but we also have so many backlogs in front of us that bookings are not necessarily the best indicator for where strength of the business is.  Unsupported can come both from a business that is -- something which is booked inside of the quarter. But more often than not, what is happening is that people are pulling in their requirements. So it's already backlog
Ganesh Moorthy: We have and people would like to get it sooner than we can provide it to them, and so a lot of factors that go into that unsupported. But the bottom line is, that whatever we are able to produce and the growth that we're able to deliver, despite it being 26% year-over-year, is far from what is required to meet what customers are telling us what they want in a given quarter.  And that keeps squeezing out and we keep shipping more every quarter and we'll squeeze some more out in the several subsequent quarters that we can't ship into this quarter. And it just reflects how demand is continuing to outstrip, or the demand growth is continuing to outstrip the supply growth for multiple quarters. And we do not see a bending of that curve through much of 2022.
David O’Connor: Got it. Thanks. Good luck.
Operator: We'll take our final question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer: Guys, thanks for letting me ask the follow-up. I had two quick ones. Eric, just on the CapEx, you guided for this year. I'm just kind of curious how we should think about next year, especially given the exit trajectory. And then Ganesh, you guys are really kind enough to give us both kind of a revenue number and an end market demand number.  I'm just kind of curious of how to think --how we should think about the relationship between the two, because this quarter, it did look like your revenues were above end demand, and I'm just trying -- to understand what that means, especially in light of how constrained you seem to be in the business.
Eric Bjornholt: So I'll start with CapEx. So CapEx, as I indicated, is the forecast is between $350 million and $400 million for FY'22. In our investor and Analyst Day next Monday, we will give you some parameters in terms of how to think about CapEx and percentage of revenue on a go-forward basis, but again, not going to take away from that messaging today.  We haven't given a FY'23 forecast as of yet. And overall, it will depend on what the shape of the demand picture looks like and how our capacity is coming in and what is needed in the business to support customers.
Ganesh Moorthy: You want to talk about end markets; did you want me to do that?
Eric Bjornholt: Go ahead
Ganesh Moorthy: For multiple quarters, you've seen that the end market demand has been higher and the GAAP revenue that we've had. The difference at this quarter is small. Distribution inventory still continue to decline by one day. In this case, there's nothing meaningful in that number for this quarter.
John Pitzer: Perfect. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Well, it's basically constrained by distribution inventory. They don't have much to ship. What they have left is really all slower moving slots. They need a lot of new product from us to be able to increase the end-market demand, and in some cases, some of the product has been prioritized to PSP customers and there is more direct PSP backlog than the distribution backlog.  Significantly, more direct customers have gone PSP than through distribution. So therefore, much more of the product has been skewed towards direct customers, and distribution would like more, but there is no capacity. So I think that would limit --
John Pitzer: That it makes a lot of sense, Steve; I think we're all learning that perhaps supply chains are a little bit more complex than that we once thought.
Steve Sanghi: Yes, exactly. Okay.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time for closing remarks, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Moorthy. Please go ahead.
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, thank you, everyone for attending. We look forward to providing you a lot more insight on Monday, when we have the Investor and Analyst Meeting. And we will be doing some of the circuit during the quarter as well for other investor meetings. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference, we appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2021-08-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to Microchip’s First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Financial Results. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Microchip’s CFO, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip’s President and CEO; and Steve Sanghi, Microchip’s Executive Chair. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal-year 2022 financial performance. Ganesh will then give commentary on our results and financial business environment as well as our guidance. And Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the investor relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information on our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. We will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margins and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. Net sales in the June quarter were $1.569 billion, which was up 7% sequentially, and about 150 basis points above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance given on May 6. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography as well as our total and market demand on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 64.8% and operating income was a record 41.7%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $558.8 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record of $1.98, $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis in the June quarter gross margins were record at 64.2% and include the impact of $8.8 million of share-based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $638.8 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $215.6 million, special charges of $10.5 million, $3.6 million of acquisition related and other costs, and share-based compensation of $47.8 million. GAAP net income was $252.8 million or $0.89 per diluted share. Our June quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors. Notably tax reserve releases associated with the statute of limitations expiring. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6% in the June quarter, we expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal 2022 to be about 6% exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2021 was $683.8 million. We had a 111 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, which was down one day from the prior quarters’ level. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter were at 20 days, which is a record low level and down from 22 days at the end of the prior quarter. We are ramping capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship as much product as possible to support customer requirements. In the June quarter, we issued a $1 billion senior secured note maturing on September 1, 2024 and bearing interest at 0.983%. We use the proceeds from this bond offering to repay a $1 billion senior secured note that matured on June 1, 2021 that had an interest rate of 3.922%. We believe this was another excellent transaction for us as we continue to enhance our capital structure on our path to becoming an investment grade rated company. Our cash flow from operating activities was a record at $629.9 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $279.7 million. We paid down $388 million of total debt in the June quarter. Over the last 12 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition, and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $4 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this time period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business, as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was a record $711.7 million and our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA was also a record of at $2.524 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037. And there’s more equity-like in nature was 3.34 at June 30, 2021, down from 3.71 at March 31. Our dividend payment in the June quarter was $113.1 million. Capital expenditures were $86.3 million in the June quarter. Our forecast for the September 2021 quarter’s capital expenditures is between $75 million and 95 million. Our capital expenditures for all of fiscal year 2022 are expected to be between $300 million and $350 million. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 capital expenditures came in lower than originally planned due to longer equipment lead times and deliveries pushing out due to overall industry conditions. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $41.2 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter, as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter results continued to be strong, leading off our fiscal year 2022 on a positive note. June quarter revenue was an all time record of $1.57 billion growing 7% sequentially, and was 150 basis points higher than the midpoint of our guidance provided on May 5. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter revenue was up 19.8%. Non-GAAP gross margins were another record and 64.8% up 70 basis points from the March quarter as we continue to ramp our internal factories and benefit from improved fixed cost absorption. Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 41.7% up 100 basis points from the March quarter. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was above the high end of our guidance at a record $1.98 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for the June quarter was again very strong and achieved another record at $701.7 million, continuing to demonstrate the robust profitability and cash generation capabilities of our business through the business cycles. The June quarter marked 123 consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. I would like to take this occasion to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results in the June quarter. And especially thank the worldwide Microchip team whose tireless efforts not only delivered our strong financial results, but also supported our customers to navigate a difficult environment and who work constructively with our supply chain partners to find creative solutions in an extremely constrained and challenging environment. Taking a look at our business from a product line perspective, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up 10.7% as compared to the March quarter and set a new quarterly record. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter microcontroller revenue was up 26%. Each of the 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontroller product lines established new all time revenue records. As we have told you many times in the past rumors of the depth of 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers have been greatly exaggerated. The customers and applications served by microcontrollers, not highly fragmented, and require a wide range of solutions that span the breadth of our microcontroller product lines. Microcontrollers represented 57.5% of our revenue in the June quarter. Our analog revenue was sequentially up 4.1% as compared to the March quarter, also setting a record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter analog revenue was up 16.7%. Analog represented 27.5% of our revenue in the June quarter. Other revenue was sequentially up 5.1% in the June quarter, bouncing back from a 6.4% sequential decline in the March quarter. Other revenue represented 15% of our revenue in the June quarter. Taking a look at our business from a geographic perspective, Americas was up 6.1% sequentially. Europe was down 2.3% sequentially, which is better than typical seasonal performance and came off of a very strong 30.4% sequential growth in the March quarter. Asia was up a strong 11.1% sequentially reflecting better than typical seasonal growth. From an end market perspective, all end markets were strong in the June quarter. Business conditions continued to be exceptionally strong through the quarter with record bookings and backlog for product to be shipped over multiple quarters accentuated by our Preferred Supply Program or PSP, which continues to be over 50% of our aggregate backlog and 100% of our backlog in the most constrained capacity product areas. Demand outpaced the capacity improvements we were able to make or we were able to implement in the quarter. As a result our unsupported backlog, which customers want to shipped in the June quarter continued to climb significantly resulting in lead time for many line items continuing to stretch out. We experienced constraints and all of our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. We continue to work closely with our supply chain partners who provide wafer foundry, assembly, test and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible. Through the combination of internal and external actions that we have taken, we expect we will be in a position to support revenue growth for at least each of the next four quarters. Despite that, we also expect that wafer fab as well as assembly and test constraints will persist through at least the middle of 2022. We believe our backlog position, especially the proportion of PSP backlog is giving us a solid foundation to prudently acquire constrained raw materials, invest in expanding factory capacity, and hire employees to support our factory ramps. Our capital spending plans are rising in response to growth opportunities in our business, as well as to fill gaps in the level of capacity investments by our outsourced fab, assembly and test partners in technologies that they may consider to be trailing edge, but which we believe will be workhorse technologies for us for many years to come. The increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities and improve our gross margins, increase our market share, and give us more control over our destiny for trailing edge technologies. We will of course continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsourced partners. But our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities which may not align with ours. We also expect that while our capital intensity may be slightly higher in any given year, and the 3% to 4% of revenue guidance we have provided in the past. When looked at in the context of a rolling three year view, we believe we will very much be in the range of our capital spending guidance. Now, let me get into the guidance for the September quarter. Our backlog for the September quarter is very strong. In addition, we have considerable backlog requested by customers in the September quarter that currently cannot be fulfilled until later quarters despite us growing capacity from last quarter. This is because the entire semiconductor supply chain remains very constrained. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration. We expect our net sales for the September quarter to be up between 3% and 7% sequentially. Our guidance range assumes continued operational constraints, some of which we will work through during the quarter, others that would carry over to be worked in future quarters. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the September quarter would be 25.8%. We believe achievement of this revenue level would be remarkable in and of itself. But even more so given how resilient our business was a year ago during the pandemic because of the diversity of our end market exposure, thus making the year-over-year comparisons that much tougher and meaningful. For the September quarter, we expect non-GAAP gross margins to be between 64.8% and 65.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 22.8% and 23.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 41.6% and 42.4% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $2.05 per share, and $2.17 per share. We also expect to pay down another approximately $350 million of our debt in the September quarter. Now, we recognize that our gross and operating margin percentage guidance effectively gets us to the long-term targets we shared with you just nine months ago. We will be working to update our business model for annual growth, gross margin and operating margin percentage. And we’ll share our conclusions with you later this year. Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, and inventory right up on acquisitions Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track it results on a non-GAAP basis, except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. Now, let me pass the baton to Steve to talk about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh and good afternoon everyone. Today, I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter and making new records in many respects. Namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record cash flow from operations and record adjusted EBITDA also each of our strategic product lines, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers, and analog individually achieved all time new records in net sales. Reflecting on our journey since the acquisition of Microsemi, three years ago, I note the following. Number one, at the time of the acquisition, we provided a long-term operating model target of 40.5% non-GAAP operating margin, which we exceeded for the first time in the March 2021 quarter. And we’re significantly above that in the June 2021 quarter at 41.7%. At the time of the acquisition, we also indicated that we anticipated achieving an $8 non-GAAP EPS run rate by the end of the third year after the acquisition. Between the $1.98 EPS for the June quarter we just announced and $2.11 EPS we guided to for the September quarter at the midpoint of our guidance. We have effectively delivered on this expectation. These exceptional results were achieved despite the numerous headwinds we faced from international trade tensions and tariffs, as well as the global pandemic, which matters were not predictable three years ago. Number two; we financed the Microsemi acquisition by adding $8.1 billion of debt, driving up a net leverage ratio in the June 2018 quarter to 4.95, which we know was a concern for many of you. In the last three years, we have paid down a cumulative $4 billion of debt and brought our net leverage ratio down to 3.34. We continue to allocate substantially all of our cash generation beyond what we paid to shareholders in dividends to pay down significant debt every quarter. Number three, within the last quarter based on the debt pay down, we had achieved and the continued strong cash and adjusted EBITDA generation of our business both Moody’s and Fitch, change their rating outlook from stable to a positive outlook. At the rate, we expect to pay down our debt and bring our net leverage further down. We believe we are on target to achieve an investment grade rating sometime by the end of fiscal year 2022. Regarding our cash return strategy, we are continuing to provide more cash return to the shareholders. Just today, we announced a dividend of $43.7 per share, our third largest dividend increase by increasing the dividend by 5.8% sequentially, and 18.75% over a year ago quarter. And in the coming quarters, we expect to continue with more actions to increase the cash return to shareholders. With that, operator will you please poll for questions?
Operator: Absolutely. Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from a Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Hi guys, thank you so much for taking my question and congrats on the strong results. Just wanted to ask about gross margins in the June quarter and the outlook going forward, clearly very strong results in the quarter, with margins coming in above the high end of guidance, curious, what drove the upside vis-à-vis your expectations? Was it primarily utilization rates? Or was there something else behind the beat. And, Ganesh you talked about, you guys performing already in line with your long-term model, as you think about, your ability to expand gross margins going forward. And as you in source I guess both front end wafer processing as well as assembly and test, how should we think about the potential upside there going forward? Again, in terms of gross margin. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Let me have Eric respond to the first part, and I’ll respond to the second part.
Eric Bjornholt: Okay, so your gross margin on the quarter, we are utilizing our manufacturing resources, fully at this point in time, we have more orders, and we know what to do with. And with that we’re being quite efficient in our manufacturing operation. So it’s really, best utilizing our capacity. And we’re obviously continue to make investment in capital, bringing that online as quickly as we can, increase in the percentage of assembly and test that we do internally. But the major driver was just effective utilization of what factories and equipment that we have.
Ganesh Moorthy: To your second question, give us some time to put some thought into how we see gross margins building over time, what the long-term model should be. And we will come back to you later this year with a more complete picture of what that will be and what the drivers will be. Many of them are what you just described, which is as we do more in sourcing. There’s a richer product mix that comes into play, there’s pricing discipline. Those are all going to be important parts. But we need some time to process where we are, where we can get to, how we get there and then we’ll come back to you with some numbers.
Toshiya Hari: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next we’ll hear from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Yes, guys, congratulations on a strong results. Thanks for let me ask the question. Ganesh, it’s pretty astounding that disti inventories are now down to 20 days, it kind of makes the disti model, kind of a little bit less valuable. I’m kind of curious, what is the risk that your end customers can’t rely on disti and so there’s more of an inventory build going on there, then you can see, one. And two, on the more positive, given what’s happening in disti and this idea of just in time inventory management, going to just in case, do you see yourself getting closer to end customers over time, strategically? And what might that mean for margins?
Ganesh Moorthy: John, the distribution inventory is low, in part because we are constrained right? So distributors continue to serve as customers. But we are not able to help them grow their inventory. At some point, we will be able to as we get our production up to be able to ship them more for them to help build that. But for the moment, neither their customers nor distribution has the ability to grow inventory in any meaningful form. When we look at, where are the number of customer requests we’re getting either direct or indirect through distribution on shortages, lines downs and all that, it’s pretty well represented across the spectrum. It isn’t that one group of customers is doing better than the other. There are a large number of customers who are unable to get what they want, and are in the short or medium term, trying to get more product. In some cases trying to get product through, more than one source if they can, but the constraints are all over the place. And so I’m not seeing channel inventory or customer inventory building in a way that, you can read something into the distribution, days of inventory.
John Pitzer: And Ganesh, so my second half of the question does this change the distribution model structurally for you, and is there an opportunity to get closer to customers, and maybe capture some of that disti margin that you’re giving them now?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, we have 125ish, 125,000 or so customers we serve. Clearly distribution is an important part of that model to reach that long tail of customers. And customers make the final choice on where do they want to buy, they have an opportunity to buy direct, they have an opportunity to buy from our web channel, they have an opportunity to buy from distribution. And they buy from distribution when they see that the value that distribution is bringing them in support, in payment terms and pipelining of inventory and other ways that distribution adds value is good for them. But, we continue to serve customers through the channel that they find to be the most effective for them. And if that is someone who wants to move direct, so be it for someone who wants to stay with channels, so be it. But whatever relatively channel agnostic and what we’re doing, clearly in a time of escalation, more distribution customers are reaching through directly to us to get help. But that does not necessarily mean that they will shift off of distribution and then to us directly.
Eric Bjornholt: John, I will add that carrying inventory for customers is only one part of the value that distribution provides. And clearly, they have very low inventory today. Also to do with our inability to shape but that’s not the only value distribution provides. They provide kitting, payment terms, programming, they provide all sorts of services for which they charge. So, I think distribution will continue to be an important element of Microchips go-to-market strategy, which reaches a very, very long tail.
John Pitzer: Okay, Eric. Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. And next, we’ll hear from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. You gave a 3% to 7% on sequential growth rate for the September quarter; it’s kind of in line with the sequential growth rates, we have seen in the last few quarters. Is this being really driven by supply growth, and if that is the case, how should we think about incremental supply that could come online in the next several quarters? Because I believe Ganesh has said that you expect to grow sequentially for the next four quarters, if I heard correctly. So, should we be keeping this 3% to 7% sequential growth rate in mind, as we try to model out the next four quarters? Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: So, I want to be clear, we’re not providing any kind of guidance that goes beyond the September quarter. We are clearly working on supply improvements. And today, all of our growth is constrained not by demand, but by supply. There are supply improvements were making that are in our control, which is what runs through our manufacturing internally, what we are doing there to increase capacity in each of our fabs at our assembly, our tests, we’re working with our supply chain partners who bring us materials and all of that. And we’re working on capacity improvements with our partners that we do outsourced work through. So, I think, we’ll give you the quarter-by-quarter growth, as we get to the guidance for the December and March and June quarters and all that. But I think what we do see is enough capacity coming on in the subsequent quarters. And the timing is a bit hard to call because, we don’t have a stable environment in which we know exactly what equipment will come on, when will bring on the capacity and all that. But we’re confident enough in how we see capacity coming on that we do expect that each of the next four quarters will have growth in there.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next we’ll hear from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava: Hi, thank you. Can we get back to the PSP program? I think you we’re 44% of the business was under that and Ganesh you said over 50% is there a natural feeling to this? And it kind of tied to that getting back to the capacity. And this must be a tougher equation to get to, is it’s a very fragmented industry, both microcontroller and analog. So, how do you balance capacity increase versus what others are doing, it’s not like DRAM, but there’s only three guys and everybody kind of thinks they know what the other person is doing. So, Ganesh and Steve, how do you balance the capacity increase versus down the road when there could be a potential oversupply?
Ganesh Moorthy: Let me start first on the PSP question, right. Our PSP backlog exiting the June quarter was over 50%. And it grew throughout the quarter. And we have customers continuing to enroll in the program, as well as extend the time that they’re providing us the backlog. But, the metric is really something that was important to us to convey during the early stages of launching the PSP program. And so at this point in time, rather than trying to provide a, month-by-month or quarter-by-quarter update, it’s a part of our normal business that we’re doing. Certain capacity corridors, as I’ve explained, are 100% booked already, and we will just manage it, it gives us visibility, it gives us a better ability to service those customers who have long-term backlog that they can place, that are not just non-cancelable. That was the whole objective of what we did. And then to your second question, in many ways, PSP is one element of what we have, that helps us to make sure that the other side of the cycle whenever it is, can be managed well. We’re also bringing capacity on, in measured steps, we’re not trying to, get all of the unsupported done in a short period of time. So every quarter, we’re increasing capacity. And so combination of what we’re doing with measured steps and capacity, what we’re doing with the PSP program, and all of that gives us reasonable confidence to be able to manage the cycle in such a way that we don’t get over committed on the capacity side.
Ambrish Srivastava: That makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: And thank you so much. Our next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.
Harsh Kumar: Yes, Hey, guys, first of all, congratulations on the stellar results. I had actually a couple I want to go back to the question that Vivek asked about growth for the next four quarters. So, let me see if I understand this correctly Ganesh, you expect supply constrains for the next four quarters. But you also expect demand environment to remain pretty solid or robust. And therefore you’re pretty comfortable forecasting growth for the revenue growth in the next four quarters, are you just referring to that you will have enough supply to be able to meet your demand exist?
Ganesh Moorthy: We have a very strong demand backlog on us. We have a substantial portion of PSP backlog on us. We continue to have a large amount that were – that is unsupported. So the demand environment we see is very, very strong. Now, the balance is really what can we supply? And how much can we bring on? And our supply lines as we can see continue to give us the ability to bring more supply on quarter-after, quarter-after-quarter for at least the next four quarters, giving us that line of sight into having the capability to take advantage of that demand and grow every quarter.
Harsh Kumar: Understood, thanks for that clarity. And then for my follow-up, maybe one for Steve. Steve, so everybody in the semi industry that’s established like yourself, otherwise guys are talking about the cash flow strategy more and more in cash from accounting, but at the same time, there’s very good growth in the industry. So, we appreciate the cash return. But with the industry still growing, why not use some of that cash for things like acquisitions? Or maybe other things like growth? Just could you help us balance that argument?
Steve Sanghi: I think, the way we have described before is that, we begin our acquisition process back about 13 years ago, when we were, well below a $1 billion company. And we were I think we were probably worth only $700 million, $750 million company. And we were trying to scale the business 10x, so that we don’t have a competitive disadvantage against a larger competitors. So TI is still larger, but many of the others in Infineons and STs and Maxim’s and ADIs and, we’re really caught up to all of them in the last 12 or 13 years by scaling the business almost 10x at the current quarter guidance, we’re running somewhere in excess of $6.5 billion. And we wanted to do that, while building a portfolio of products around the microcontroller so that we can provide the entire total system solution to the customers, having analog some memories and some connectivity, USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, in all that power management and everything else. So those two things we accomplished. We scale the business almost 10x and we acquired a organically build all these products to be able to complete customers solution. So at this point in time, and I think we have said a couple of times that we don’t find the next acquisition to be necessary. Given small acquisitions here and there tuck-in tied, if the opportunity arises, we would but we’re not really working on and looking at any large acquisition, because that’s strategically not needed today. We have enough product portfolio and we’re working very hard to train our sales force and customers to be able to use the entire total system solution from Microchip and show the organic growth. And as we adopt that strategy, and as we pay down substantial amount of debt already, and continue to pay it further, then you have a larger, somewhere around $1.5 billion burning hole in your pocket. And what do you do with that? You’re seeing, why don’t we acquire, and I’m seeing, we do not find that strategically needed today. So, what we’re planning to do is, as we achieve the investment grade rating, and as the debt level comes down further, then we start getting larger and larger amount of cash back to the shareholders, some in the form of dividend and some starting buyback program. So, that’s sort of the summary of where our current strategy is.
Ganesh Moorthy: And Harsh if I may add to, in with respect to your question, I think any OpEx or CapEx that is needed to grow the business is part of what we’re doing every quarter, right, that’s in built into our business model. It’s really then the capital allocation of, what we do beyond that that Steve was describing.
Steve Sanghi: And some of the smaller companies, maybe acquiring, I think, the really sort of cutting edge strategy, which we concluded in the prior 13 years, when they were not buying and maybe they’re buying something today. We don’t do something because somebody else is doing, I think, we had a laid out strategy, we completed that phase. And that part of the strategy is no longer important. So therefore, we’re going to the next phase.
Harsh Kumar: Got it. Appreciated, guys. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And next, we’ll hear from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results and execution. Back in early May, I think the team had said that the demand trends were 40% above your ability to supply and then by late May, the gap had widened to 50%. It sounds like the gap either remained extended or may have even expanded. So if you can just give us a sense of how wide the demand supply gap is today as it’s sitting above 50%. And it sort of seems as if we move into the second half of the year, demand is only getting stronger. You have areas like data center and enterprise, for example, which were weak last year and into the first half of this year, which are starting to pick up any other end markets where demand is strongly accelerating from a softer first half?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, Harlan first on the, the unsupported backlog. Exiting June, that unsupportive backlog was higher than what it was both what they said in our conference call as well as where it was, at the end of March. The demand increase in the June quarter outpaced the supply improvements we could make. And hence, we expect, as we go in through September, every indication we have is that the percentage of unsupported exiting September will be higher than where it was at the end of June. So that trend continues. We are not seeing demand and supply starting to converge, or get into any kind of balance itself. Was there a second part of the question?
Harlan Sur: Just in terms of end markets that were weak either last year and into the first half of this year, for example, like data center and enterprise, which feel like they’re starting to accelerate as we move into the second half? Is that a dynamic that you’re seeing in any other end markets where demand is strongly accelerating from maybe a slightly softer first half?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, as we said, all end markets were strong as we went through the June quarter. Some have been strong in prior quarters as well. We don’t track end markets on a quarter-to-quarter by end market basis on it. But anecdotally, some of what you’re saying is correct. And we do see strengthened data centers in the second half of the year. And I don’t recall what the year-over-year comparisons were on them. But right now, there is no market that is, feeling weak.
Harlan Sur: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And next we’ll hear from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo securities.
Gary Mobley: Everybody, thanks for taking my question. Want to ask about some long-term supply agreements that may support that 60% of your sales that are sourced externally in the front end side and the 40% on the back end side. I know some of your competitors are entering LTSAs and in quantifying them and SEC filings and I haven’t seen your queue yet. But have you guys officially entered into more LTSAs, and maybe you can just sort of give us a sense of, how they rank relative to your sales, or how they rank relative last quarter. And then on the flip side of the coin, I was curious to know what your financial penalties may be for those customers that have entered to non-cancelable, non-returnable backlog agreements you guys?
Ganesh Moorthy: So with respect to LTAs right, we have a range of how we have those agreements, I don’t believe any of them have been big enough to be in our queues. So, you’re not going to see something there. That we have a long set of partners both on the front and the back end, we’ve worked with them quite constructively, at this point in time. So that’s where we are on at in terms of our capacity for 2022 and beyond and what we need to do to secure it. On the NCNR agreements themselves, those are, there’s a legal agreement, that’s a purchase agreement that we enter into, which have, obligations on our side, obligations on the customer side. And, we’ve had these, this is not new. We’ve done this for many, many years on a smaller subset of our business, and we have not found problems and enforcing the NCNR portions of our purchase contracts.
Gary Mobley: Makes sense.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from William Stein with Truist Securities.
William Stein: Great, thanks for taking my question. I’ll add my congrats on the great results and outlook. First, I’d like to have clarification around capital allocation. What is your target leverage ratio? When would you slow down or stop the debt repurchases? And what would be the plan after that? Because naturally, you typically get to a certain leverage ratio, if you’re continuing to grow EBITDA and that adding debt and you wind up, having that debt ratio continued to decline. So, I’m wondering if you can clarify the plans around sort of tapering the debt repurchase.
Ganesh Moorthy: Okay. Well, I’ll start and Steven going to ask and can add on to this if they want. So, we don’t have a stated target for our net debt to EBITDA. But we’ve made it very clear that we’re focused on achieving an investment grade rating. And, believe that that’s something that we can achieve in this fiscal year, independent decision, obviously, by the rating agencies, but we’re making good progress on that. And even once we get there, you shouldn’t assume that we stopped paying down debt, we will continue to pay down debt, but we’ll have more flexibility to increase dividends more or have a stock buyback program, and you’ll flex that as it’s appropriate for our business. So Steve, what would you like to add to that?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, I think you said it well, the board has not defined a bottom number for the debt leverage at which we will essentially start paying down debt and give 100% of the cash back. They have not really defined that number. In future they might. In addition, even if we add Sundays stop paying debt. As a business rises and EBITDA rises, the leverage will continue to come down without even paying the debt, which was one of your point also. So that’s where we are, I think it’s a work in progress, we keep giving you update every quarter. We’re getting fairly close to the investment grade rating. In my comments, I said, by the end of fiscal year 2022, which is March next year, again, it’s a independent decision by the rating agencies, but we expect that, we achieve the financial and leverage metrics, which should get us there by then. And at that point in time, the board will have lot more flexibility to give a, to start a buyback program and also increase dividend. That’s where we are today.
Ganesh Moorthy: I’d just add to that, but we have made significant increases in our dividend in the last three quarters, and it’s up 18.8%, year-over-year with the three large sequential increases that we’ve made. So we’re definitely heading in the right direction from a capital return standpoint, but the next step is investment grade, and then we’ll take it from there.
William Stein: Great. One more if I can, we’re in this environment, you could – some people describe it as peak, some people describe it as peaking or extended peak, or there’s a lot of ways to think about it. But it’s certainly a very good part of the cycle and maybe raises questions as to how close to rolling over we are. I wonder if you could maybe highlight for us, how you compare this cycle to others, which prior cycles this one reminds you of? And what are sort of the key signs you’re going to be looking for to provide a warning to yourselves around how to manage the business for a fade or role in the cycle? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: I don’t think this one resembles any prior cycle. And to some extent, many of these extraordinary cycles are all unique in and of themselves at the question of what precipitated them and what is happening. So, this is a cycle unlike one we have seen before, for many reasons. We constantly look at a set of internal indicators to look ahead and peek around the corner to see when is something possibly changing. They run the gamut of bookings, billings, sell-through, the rate at, which customers are able to have confidence in what they’re placing with us in backlog. Our anecdotal conversations with the executives of many of our customers of our channel partners. So, it’s a process of many, many points of data, that we as a team meet on a weekly basis and compare notes and see what we see, in terms of what does the data tell us? And historically we’ve been able to see things early. I hope we will do the same this time too. At this point, there is no indication of any early warnings.
William Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next we’ll hear from Janet Ramkissoon with Quadra Capital.
Janet Ramkissoon: Congratulations, guys, nice quarter. I was wondering if you might be able to give us any insights on what your demand might be from China, or just more in terms of what the trends are, and what you see going forward and also, if you can make some comments about what you see in the auto industry specifically? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: So, China is part of our reporting for Asia. In fact, it’s a substantial portion of our Asia revenue. I think it’s about two thirds or so of that revenue. We reported that that geography grew 11% last quarter, a little over 11%, it is performing as we expect, it remains strong. So, there are no China demand issues that are visible and then what we see. With respect to automotive, we are continuing to increase the shipments to automotive. We are shipping well above where we were pre-pandemic, but the automotive demand also is quite substantially higher. It is a matter of they have many, many companies that supply product to build a car and so you do hear about factories shutting down and customers not able to build what they want. And we are providing the products that we can provide at a rate that is consistent with our manufacturing. But we’re still short to what automotive would like to buy for their growth and for their growth plans.
Janet Ramkissoon: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. And next we’ll hear from Chris Danely with Citi.
Chris Danely: Hey, thanks, guys. Actually talked about all these cycles being different and we read all these headlines about worst shortages ever. And apparently, the politicians are going to try and make sure that there’s never any cycles and semis again, I just appreciate your guy’s perspective. Do you think that this is a – I guess the worst upturn ever from a customer standpoint? Or I guess, alternatively, you could argue that it’s the best upturn ever from a semiconductor supplier? And are you guys looking to do anything differently? Or is the industry looking to do anything differently in future cycles that prevent these kinds of shortages? Or do you think that this is just the normal course of business?
Ganesh Moorthy: There were an extraordinary set of circumstances that got us to where we are. The pandemic was one part of that, the trade and tariff issues the year before that was another part of that. And then make not only create a demand side – sorry, supply side issues, but created a lot of money that consumers had, and they wanted to spend it, and they spent it on things that required electronics for it, they required things to work out of the home. So, I think there are all kinds of factors that came into where we are. And, of course, many customers in uncertainty in the pandemic took their demand down and then realize that they’re taking it down too far. I don’t know what the future brings. Clearly many of our customers are thinking through, how should they – from an inventory standpoint, be preparing themselves, so that they are able to run more stable through the cycles, et cetera, and where they go. I think there is a continued strong demand where people are building and selling through what they’re doing. I don’t know what the shape of the next cycle would be. And more importantly, what would be the causes of the next cycle? And I think to a large extent, those will determine what the responses will be. And I certainly don’t think government help is going to be the answer to any of these cycles. And from usually, when a government begins to think of something, the cycle is long passed before they can even act with respect to that. So, I am very confident that the industry, through many, many, many cycles, has figured out how to make adjustments and how to build in such a way that is consistent with where the market is at. And they will do the same in this cycle. I don’t know, Steve, you’ve got longer years on this than I do?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think in the last several years, we have read reports, people calling the end of cyclicality in the semiconductor business, there’ll be no more cycles, I think all that is wrong. Like Ganesh said, the events that precipitated this cycle could not have been forecasted two years ago. So, when that happens, and it put a major pressure on the industry from both sides, decreasing the supply line and increasing the demand, in certain cases driven by work from home and medical and other. It created this supercycle that we haven’t seen in 40 years. Similar other situations where to come in five years from now, 10 years from now, it will create a cycle again. So those cycles have really not been repealed. People will make some adjustments, maybe keep larger inventory, and do some other things. Some people are trying to get long-term agreements for supply. But it’s not predictable how much supplies needed five years from now, and many of those agreements you will see will have a bad ending. If there is a recession, people are not going to need that product. There’ll be their excess inventory, pay for play agreements don’t work out very well usually.
Chris Danely: Got it. Thanks for the perspective guys.
Steve Sanghi: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Raji Gill with Needham and Company.
Raji Gill: Yes, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations, as well. A couple of questions, if I may, one on the pricing environment, last quarter, Ganesh you had mentioned that you were engaged in some price increases, and that was reflected in the revenue. I’m wondering how you’re describing the pricing dynamic this quarter. How is that affecting the revenue? How is that affecting kind of the gross margin improvement on a sequential basis as well?
Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So the price increases largely have a template to pass on cost increases that we’ve had. And we continue to get cost increases on a pretty regular basis in the current environment, depending on what the material or the product that we need to buy and as they come along, we don’t do it all instantaneously. We will batch it and figure it out points at which we will do the increase in prices to go with it. And so that’s a continuous process, and as and when it is needed, in terms of us collecting the data. And at this point in time, there’s nothing in our pricing, thought process that would be different from what I said three months ago. If there is a need, if there are costs increases that we cannot absorb. We patch it at some point in time, and we pass along the price increase.
Raji Gill: And for my follow-up, you had mentioned that you will have capacity to support revenue growth in each of the next four quarters. I was wondering if you could elaborate further in terms of the capacity increases, is that coming on the foundry side on the test and assembly, which areas do you think are easier to get more capacity, which areas are harder? I would think that the foundries have been reluctant to spend on kind of laggy edge nodes. So on the wafer side, it might be a bit more challenging, but it any color specifically in terms of the capacity. That would be helpful. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: The area we have the most. And the where we have been investing for multiple quarters is in our internal factories. So, we expect that there will be more help coming, where we have more control, which is in our fabs, our assembly and test factories, et cetera. It doesn’t mean we’re not getting anything from our partners we are, it’s selective, it’s really depends on the situation and where we’re getting. But it is correct that more help is coming from the factories, we control them from our foundry and assembly, test partners.
Raji Gill: Appreciated. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. Next we’ll hear from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Two questions a little bit unrelated. One is a follow up on pricing Ganesh, from the last question. And given what the margins are, you’re obviously going to be able to pass on some of the higher input costs to customers. But if the input cost situation were to change and come down a bit, with the long-term agreements that are you’re putting in place under the PSP program, how stable or durable or how much length is there to some of the new pricing negotiations you’re having? Or do you expect those to sort of moderate as input costs moderate if and when they do? And the second question completely unrelated, is, I noticed some press releases about silicon carbide from you guys. Within the last week, it seems like a much more expansive program than you might have had in the past. Is that the right read? And I guess how important of a program is that for you guys going forward? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Okay. So on the pricing front, right, I mean, I think there is no insight into which way input costs are growing. At this point in time, every indication is that input costs are going up in 2022. And we’re already starting to hear of input costs going up in 2023. If and when there is a change in the trajectory of input costs, we will relook at it at that point in time, and so nothing to really say about input costs, changing directions at this point in time. In regards to Silicon carbide, it is a program that is important, has focused, and we have been bringing out products on a pretty consistent basis there, and is an important part of our growth strategy is to capitalize on the markets, which have both industrial and automotive components with industrialized realizing revenues sooner. By bringing the benefits of silicon carbide to those markets, they go nicely hand in hand with many of our microcontrollers that play into these power conversion opportunities, which is where silicon carbide plays. So yes, it’s, we haven’t made a big deal of it. But it is an important product line and important initiative for growth for us.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And next we’ll hear from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good evening. I wanted to ask a bit more about what you’re talking about earlier, about relying a bit more on internal capacity as opposed to foundries going forward. First, what happened within the industry that is kind of causing this shortage in foundry and we recognizing that the industry really didn’t – foundry industry didn’t really expand capacity and lagging edge nodes in the past? But why are we at the point now? Where there’s just none left and no willingness to extend that. And then following that, if you are going to increase your reliance on internal capacity, how is it that you stay within the same 3% to 4% of revenue CapEx model? How does that work going forward?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, first of all, I think, in the – from an industry perspective, it’s just the rate of growth that foundries seeing on these lagging edge technologies is so far ahead of any normal planning that they have done. That – it’s overwhelming, what the capacity available is? Well, the normal reaction you would say is, well, why aren’t they building more? Well, the economics of that for the foundries and the opportunity cost versus other capital objectives that they have, don’t always lend themselves to saying that trailing edge capacity is where they want to be invested. It’s not that they’re making no investments, they are, but they’re not fast enough. And they’re not at a rate for products that we consider to be important for us. Now, we’re not doing it across the board, we’re just picking and choosing places where we think there is significant constraint for us, our opportunity for us to make that investment. And that is true not only in the fab, that’s true in assembly and test as well as to why we’re doing it. And what we’re seeing. It will mean that we will continue to use all of the capacity available from our foundry and assembly test partners. Plus, we will try to make sure that we have where we can additional capacity to be able to not be constrained by what is available only from our outside partners itself. In terms of the CapEx itself, I mean, you’ve seen – if you go back and look at our history, last 5, 10 years, you’ll find that we have gone above and below that 3% to 5% – 3% to 4% number, I think the two years previous to this, we were at about 1%. And that’s where the cycle was, that’s what we needed in that. So, I think a three year look, gives you a better sense. And we could spend more than 3% to 4% in any given year, as we look at investing at a time when that need is there, and then we’ll breathe with that capacity and let it all build out over that time. But at this point in time, that’s what we feel comfortable with. If that changes in time, we’ll keep you posted. But all this capital that we’re investing, all the capacities we’re bringing on, all of it, we think will be accretive to our gross margins, and will enabled growth that we would otherwise not have had, if our only choice was to take it outside.
Steve Sanghi: I’d like to clarify that the foundry part of the answer. Ordinarily, when the industry has a normal kind of growth rate, whatever it was over the last 10, 15 years, usually movement to the faster node by the leading edge guys, kept freeing up enough trailing edge capacity. So that the trailing edge guys didn’t get constrained, because the leading edge capacity of today is a trailing edge capacity of five, six years down the line. And that’s how trailing edge capacity became available, because it was originally built for people who wanted more leading edge. And then many years later there was available for the trailing edge. But when the industry grew this year, at the rate it has grown, most companies have announced year-over-year growth rates of 20% plus our September guidance is I think about 25% up versus same quarter a year ago, then that is a growth rate on the trailing edge technology is much, much higher, then really what would become available through ordinary process of nodes moving up. And so therefore, the leading edge capacity is constrained also today, it’s not like there’s all the capacity available at 40-nanometer and 28-nanometer, they’re all constrained also. But foundries are willing to add capacity on the more leading edge nodes then they are on the trailing edge given the choice of the capital allocation and their priorities they are working on more relieving the leading edge capacity, leaving the trailing edge much more constrained because of the such an aggressive growth if the growth of the industry returns back to a much more normal over the 10 years, then it’s quite possible that the trailing edge capacity will not be as constrained again.
Chris Caso: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you and our next question will come from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.
Christopher Rolland: Hey guys, thanks for the question and good quarter. What’s the plan around disti inventory? Do you guys plan to increase that from 20 days kind of ASAP? Or is this on hold as you kind of service your PSP customers or direct customers first any color there on your timing around replenishment.
Ganesh Moorthy: We don’t drive distribution, to what inventory they should carry. The numbers we report are, what their decisions are, both in terms of what they see as a demand, but in this – in the current condition, what they see as the supply available to them. PSP customers are coming to us as much from distribution as well. So, I would not take PSP and say it’s direct customers; only, many, many customers who are distribution customers are placing PSP orders on it. The issue is that when demand so far exceeds supply, you cannot build inventory internally or in the channel at that point in time. So, until we get to the point, where we can help provide more product than they’re shipping out. Distribution inventory is not likely to go up.
Steve Sanghi: We’re shipping higher and higher amounts for distribution every quarter, but it sucks out the door, because of the strong demand for sales out. So, because the supply is so constrained, you cannot really build inventory anywhere.
Christopher Rolland: Yes, understood. And this is definitely a longer term question. But is there any point or condition when you guys would ever consider a 300-millimeter fab? For example, on has the same revenue as you guys and has one? Or is it something that given your product sets and the volumes that you guys have and the runs that you guys have that you wouldn’t have any interest in?
Ganesh Moorthy: No, there are scenarios in which a 12-inch fab may make sense for us. But there’s nothing really to talk about at this point in time.
Steve Sanghi: The company you mentioned is not a good example for us, our operating margin is higher than the gross margin.
Christopher Rolland: Yes, lot more way for sure. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take a follow up from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Yes, thank you for taking my follow-up. In terms of potential uncertainties, unfortunately, we are seeing in resurgence in COVID-19 Delta variants, Southeast Asia seems to be quite impacted your idea of assembly, wafer and final tests in the Philippines and Thailand. Some of your sub cons are in Malaysia, which is probably the hardest hit, the team managed through COVID-19 shutdowns very well last year. But for the recent surge, how’s the team mitigating the potential for supply chain disruptions?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, firstly, taking our own internal factories, right. So many of the protocols that we implemented last year, to operate safely to have backup plans if people need to be inside of the factory and all that is normal part of our contingency planning. In addition, we have taken steps to accelerate how vaccines can be brought in and deployed. So for example, over the course of last week, and this week, a substantial portion of our Thailand factory is going to be fully vaccinated. We’re taking steps to get preventative things we can do. We’re trying to do the same thing in the Philippines and then we have some, some challenges to overcome to get there. We’re working with our factory partners. And, from where they’re operating, there are challenges. So far, nothing is really a major enough issue for us to result in significant loss in production. So as that data unrolled, and as we see what the rules and regulations are, we will manage around it. And as best as we can we have contingency plans. But I know it’s – there’s no, answer which says we have all scenarios thought through so far no major issues. And we’re okay with where things are at, but being prudent on where things might go.
Harlan Sur: Absolutely. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today’s question-and-answer session. Mr. Moorthy at this time, I’ll turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Ganesh Moorthy: I want to thank everybody for attending the call today. We have several investor events coming up over the next month, month and a half of timeframe. And we look forward to talking to many of you at that point in time. So thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes today’s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-05-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Microchip's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder today's call is being recorded.  At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual and events may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip’s President and CEO; and Steve Sanghi, Microchip’s Executive Chairman. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021 financial performance. Ganesh will then give their commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance. And Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter was also strong by every key metric, closing a tumultuous fiscal year on a very positive note, which was otherwise dominated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. March quarter revenue was an all time record at $1.467 billion, growing by 8.5% sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margins were another record at 64.1%, up 110 basis points from the December quarter as we benefited from improved factory utilization and product mix. Non-GAAP operating margin is also a record at 40.7%, the first time we have broken through the 40% mark. Our journey towards our long term business model of 65% gross margin and 42% operating margin is off to a good start, but still has a lot of hard work ahead of us to achieve. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was above the high end of our guidance at a record $1.85. EBITDA was very strong and achieved another record at $652.3 million, continuing to demonstrate the robust profitability and cash generation capabilities of our business through the business cycles. The March quarter also marked 122nd consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. I would like to take this occasion to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results in the March quarter, and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team whose tireless efforts not only deliver our fine strong financial results, but also supported our customers to navigate a difficult environment and who worked constructively with our supply chain partners to find creative solutions in a hyper constrained environment. Reflecting on our fiscal year 2021 results, we achieved a number of highlights and records in the last year. Revenue was a record at $5.438 billion, non-GAAP gross margin was a record at 62.8%, non-GAAP operating margin was a record at 39.6%, and non-GAAP EPS was a record at $6.59. All in all, the record March quarter results and the record March ending fiscal year 2021 results marks a seamless transition between Steve and I as we each embark on our new roles to build the next phase of Microchip's long term success. I'm truly fortunate to be the beneficiary of Steve's years of managing Microchip for the long term.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. But before I do that, I would like to say, how I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered a flawless quarter and making new records in many respects: Namely, record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage and record EBITDA. Now, I will turn to updating you on the cash return strategy. We completed the March quarter with a net debt leverage ratio of 3.71, excluding the long day to 2037 maturity converts that are more equity like in nature. At the rate, we are paying down debt we expect to break net debt leverage ratio of 3 within a year and continue to decrease from there. Around that time, we would also expect to achieve an investment grade rating, but the exact timing will depend on the analysis of the rating agencies. At that time, we expect to begin distributing more of our substantial amount of free cash flow to our investors in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. Regarding buybacks. Through our various convertible debt exchanges, we have essentially bought a substantial amount of stock back from the future. This is because as our stock price rises and exceeds the conversion price of the debt, convertible debt dilutes the share count. Buying converts back prevents future dilution as the stock price rises. Our first convert buyback was in March of 2020 when Microchip stock price was about $71. Since then we have done five other buyback transactions at various stock prices. By doing these various buyback transactions, we have purchased a total of $3.884 billion in face value of our convertible bonds. For the transactions from March 2020 to December, 2020, we issued a total of about 27.5 million shares of our common stock to the investors for in the money value of there bonds. If these bonds had remained outstanding until an assumed stock price of $160 per share, the dilution would have been about $36.4 million shares. Thus, our repurchases had the impact of creating a savings of about $8.9 million shares, worth $1.424 billion savings to our investors at that assumed price of $160 per share. This calculation does not include our February 2021 transaction, which was very recent and executed at $163.25 per share, so it is not yet accretive. While we have not done in open market stock buybacks in the last year, our convert transaction had the impact of a buyback of approximately 8.9 million shares or about 3% of our outstanding shares. We expect to start stock buybacks from the open market after we have achieved an investment grade rating, which we expect within a year depending on the rating agency. Meanwhile, we did not want to wait for starting higher dividends until our leverage ratio reaches a given number, so we initiated a path to higher dividends in our February 2021 dividend announcement with 5% dividend increase. We are continuing on this path as we announced today that the Board of Directors have approved a dividend increase of 5.9% sequentially to $41.3 per share, up from $0.39 previously. We expect to continue to increase dividends quarterly as part of our cash retention strategy. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator:  We'll take our first question from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis: Steve, I had a question for you about the PSP program. On the surface, it seems like you instituted this program to help customers on a more tactical basis. But I wonder if you believe there are secular drivers that ultimately may have led you to PSP kind of program anyway. And do you think -- now that you have this program, do you think it becomes a more permanent part of your standard operating model going forward?
Steve Sanghi: Well, going back to as we implemented the program and why we implemented the program, let's kind of revisit that history. The backlog was so strong and constraints were so widespread as Ganesh mentioned in his 40 year career and mine, 42 plus year careers, we have never seen this kind of shortage in constraints in the semiconductor industry. So the question really became how do we take our key customers in various segments, not only automotive but industrial and communications and data centers and PCs and all and allow them some mechanism where they can get preferred supply of parts, and it's something in it for them and something in it for us. And the design of that program became this Preferred Supply Program in which we asked that if you could give us 12 months of noncancelable nonreschedulable backlog, and there is a tremendous benefit to Microchip, we could buy supplies ahead, we could hire people, we could make capital investment, we could do all these things with the assurity of a very, very large, solid, noncancelable, nonscheduleable backlog, that's a benefit to us. And what the customer gets is after six month period, and we did that six months period because we don't want to create a lot of churn in the first six months, and there was more availability of capacity after six months. So at that point in time, we said anybody who gives a PSP backlog, they will get the preferred supply. And if there is any shortage at that time, it will be spread among the non PSP customers. So long answer, but that's really how the program came about, not knowing what the acceptance would be and the results just have been absolutely tremendous. We have billions of dollars of PSP backlog, 44% of the total backlog on some of the most constrained supply corridors the PSP backlog is almost equal to 100% of capacity. So you can see the advantage where we could go ahead, make those investments or buy additional equipment. Now leading then to your question, could this become a permanent landscape. I think it will depend largely on the experience of our customers and Microchip together in the year as we progress. When the cycle ends on the other cycle, when there is a lot of capacity available, customers may not be willing to make a year long commitment that is nonchangeable. So that's what the customers would be thinking, but the environments go come back and forth. So our intent would be to show the customers how well we serve them because they had PSP and what the benefits are if they continue with that program going forward. And I think -- let Ganesh comment on that, it's really going to be how we manage it going forward.
Ganesh Moorthy: So my view is we're in the early innings of PSP. We've just launched it. It's a couple of months. It's going extremely well. I think we continue to make fine tuning of the program. And it's too early to tell how long term it will be. I think for many, many customers they've learned in this cycle that running low on inventory or low on backlog visibility can have extreme impact on their business. And so give it a few more months, let's see how it looks.
Steve Sanghi: A lot of buzzwords, programs the industry develops some of them last for a short period of time in a cycle or so, and some of them last a very long period of time. I think you're seeing the beginning of the end of the word, GIT. The losses in the industry by our customers due to constraints are so large that they have lost more money than all the money they save for a decade on GIT. And that could be the long term benefit where industry plans better rather than just in time give me 50% more, where does it come from and lead times are very long.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.
Vivek Arya: When investors look at this extreme level of supply demand imbalance that their reaction is that this will surely create a hard landing. And I'm curious to get your perspective, Ganesh or Steve, that will the situation be resolved in an orderly way? When does the industry get back to a more balanced environment? What is your visibility into inventory at your end customers? Just when do we get back to normal and what does normal look like, or is there a hard or soft landing that you had to go through?
Ganesh Moorthy: We do not have a line of sight for when things get to be normal. As I mentioned, the gap between demand and supply grew in the March quarter and continues to be quite large. But we have taken a number of steps to get ahead of whatever change in cycle cycle will come to soften how that landing will take place. So we just discussed the PSP in quite a bit of detail and that gives us 12 months of continuous noncancelable backlog, and that will enable us to spot and plan for whenever that change becomes apparent to us on longer term backlog. The capacity additions we're making, we're not trying to solve the entire gap all in one quarter. We're making measured steps every quarter and improvements over multiple quarters. And to the extent we see a change, we will taper off the build plans and capacity additions consistent with that. Third is if you look at where our inventory is and where you look at our channel inventories are at historic lows from the channel perspective and pretty low for us as well. And that gives us time and ability to continue to replenish that inventory. It will help to minimize any underabsorption that might have happened otherwise. And it positions us well to capitalize on whatever the subsequent upcycle will be. There is going to be an up cycle to whatever next down cycle there's going to be. And when that happens, we actually push out capital requirements because we will have replenished some of that inventory. And finally on that if and when there is that next hard landing or soft landing. For us, what we are doing is our bonus programs and other variable compensation programs, as you've seen in prior cycles, give us a fair amount of  to mitigate which way our expenses go as we go through the cycles, and that flexibility in operating expenses is one more item that helps us in terms of getting to a soft landing.
Operator: We'll hear next from Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo Securities.
Gary Mobley: Congrats on the strong finish to the year, what a difference a year makes. I wanted to ask about your target margin goal of 65% and 42% on gross and operating margin, respectively. It would seem to me that you're in the most optimal of conditions to see the achievement of those goals with respect to revenue mix and manufacturing utilization. And so my question to you is, is that target a best case scenario, or is it sustainable over the long term? And what revenue level are you looking for to achieve those targets?
Steve Sanghi: We're making good progress towards that. We obviously, from quarter to quarter, can make rapid progress and sometimes it will be a little slower beyond that. So I wouldn't take last quarter and apply that as how it's going to be every quarter going forward. We just introduced this new model in December. So it's not been that long. And we've made a good start here. Conditions are strong for where we're at. We're executing well in the many different areas we outlined for investors as to how will we achieve the gross margins. There are also other pressures. There are cost pressures in some of the materials and input costs as well that we're working through. And then the operating expenses, we continue to have investments we need to make so that the long term growth and profitability of the business can be realized. So let's continue to have several more quarters as we go through this. But we feel good about these long term targets, and we think we're working on the right things operationally as well as in our business units and our other operating expenses to get to the place where we have a combination of good balance between growth and profitability.
Operator: We'll hear next from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.
Harsh Kumar: I had a philosophical question. With this kind of a supply demand environment, is seasonality out the door in the near to midterm? And then I have a follow up.
Ganesh Moorthy: So seasonality has been hard for us for many quarters. There hasn't been a normal environment for quite a while. We went through trade and tariff, which was an overriding issue. Then we went through COVID, which was an overriding issue. We're now in this significant demand growth environment. Clearly, there is an underlying seasonality that has contribution, but these externalities are driving a much higher multiplier on that. So for the moment, we don't have clear bearings on seasonality other than directional statements as to where they will be.
Harsh Kumar: And Ganesh, one more for you. With the PSP program, you're seeing tremendous amount of success. Are you seeing that backlog in the PSP program, mostly for the sole sourced kind of items are the ones that are mostly very constrained? Is there also a risk that you may lose some of the customers that are not able to commit or is supply simply that bad that there's no place for these guys to go?
Ganesh Moorthy: So pretty much just about everything we do is sole source proprietary products. So we don't have a commodity product line that's a big piece of this thing. Some of our memory products may come the closest. And even there, we’re often in very highly protected positions in those sockets as well. I think the short answer is exactly what you said. There is not another place people can go to, to get capacity today. In fact, there's a lot more coming to us, trying to find ways in which we can help support them as they flee some of the other suppliers who are not able to provide them capacity in today's environment.
Steve Sanghi: PSP is not an absolute requirement. So a customer who does not have visibility into their own business and does not want to give us noncancelable 12 months backlog can just place normal orders over 12 months and 90 days of those orders would be from noncancelable and after that, they can change it. The only difference is they would not be preferred. And if there was a strong demand among the PSP customers then they could get allocated much more harshly. But that doesn't mean that they won't get any part and they should really go with somebody else. If they go with somebody else, other people are similarly constrained and may not have PSP program to really help them. So I think there is no reason for loss of business. We're actually gaining business in this environment, have people coming from other companies where they cannot get the support.
Operator: We'll hear next from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Chris Caso: I've got a two part question on some of the capacity additions that you spoke of. First, if you give us some sense of the timing of these capacity additions, we know you're growing CapEx all through the year, but there's some constraints in getting tools. So when does capacity become available to you? And then secondly, if you are adding this capacity through the year and you're expecting to remain supply constrained with, I guess, some visibility from the PSP program. Is there any reason why your revenue wouldn't just continue to grow sequentially as we go through the end of the calendar year?
Ganesh Moorthy: So firstly, on the capacity additions, they are happening. There's not a single discrete event when it's happening. It's happening every month, every quarter. We have equipment on order. We have materials on order. We're hiring people. There's a number of activities that are all going in place to be able to do it. So it will be a more continuous process through the year. Sometimes we get delays on equipment. Sometimes we are able to get the equipment on the time we have. So that's the way we see it for the rest of the year. And therefore, we are expecting that we will have capacity to be higher  than the prior quarter, which should give us the ability to have continued growth as we go into the second half of this year
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava: Steve, I had a question a follow-up on, actually, on the comments on capital allocation. So could you -- that's a pretty substantial increase on divi over the last couple of quarters. What's the rate we're seeing until you get to the net leverage that you're targeting? And then longer term, what are your thoughts on divi versus buybacks? So any color or any thoughts you could share on that would be helpful. And then I had a quick follow-up on PSP, Ganesh. How do you hedge for, assuming that pricing is set earlier on when the customers are committing to this, how do you hedge for the cost side of it when cost goes up unplanned? So just help us understand that factor as well.
Steve Sanghi: So let me take the capital allocation part of that, and then Ganesh will take the pricing on the PSP backlog. So we have internally had discussions with the Board what happens now until we get investment grade rating and what happens after as we bring the stock buyback into the mix. But we're not prepared to dollarize that for you well into the future regarding how much stock buyback, and how much dividend, and when does it start and all that. So I think it's directionally the Board is committed to continue to increase dividend every quarter. And then as we get to the investment grade rating, then add the stock buyback into the mix. And what that mix would be could also change from time to time depending on market conditions and stock price and all that. So it's really not all figured out for the next five years. There have been some discussions but I think we will continue to advise you every quarter as we make further decisions.
Ambrish Srivastava: I wasn't thinking dollars, Steve, I was thinking more in terms of percent of free cash, but that's fine. We'll wait…
Steve Sanghi: So they're not willing to disclose well into the future what percentage of our free cash flow we will give it to the investors back. We would still -- when we get an investment grade rating, we would still have a leverage on the books of about 3, and desire is to continue to decrease that leverage further. 3 is not a number where we want to stop and give 100% cash back. So the leverage will continue to go down. But the rate at which that leverage go down could change as we start to give more cash back.
Ganesh Moorthy: Ambrish, on your PSP question. PSP is a priority for capacity. It is not a guarantee of price. And we will not be just making price changes without good reasons. So if there are input costs that are unexpected that need to be passed on, PSP backlog can receive price changes at that point in time. We're not anticipating that it needs to. But nothing in PSP backlog precludes price adjustments if there are significant cost increases.
Operator:  We'll hear next from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: With the current backlog -- PSP backlog, it paints a pretty good picture for demand, and based on that and combine that with your current booking trends. How far above your current supply capabilities is overall demand trending, is it 20% higher, is it 30% higher? And then given the strong demand trends, it seems like you and your distribution partners are building and buying products and immediately shipping them out. So given that and despite your capacity increases, do you guys anticipate your days of inventory and disti inventories declining again in the June quarter?
Ganesh Moorthy: So firstly, to give you a sense of what is our unsupported in a given quarter look like. I think a quarter ago, we had said, hey, we have 30% more that we could be shipping than what we are planning to ship, and that number has since grown to over 40% that we could be shipping. So that's what we meant earlier as in -- even as we add capacity, demand grows even faster. So There is a significant amount of unsupported demand into each quarter. And what happens is every quarter, we ship a little more and we squeeze some of it out into subsequent quarters. Was there a second part of the question?
Eric Bjornholt: Yes, he was asking about what our expectations were for distribution inventory. That's a very difficult thing to forecast. It went down four days last quarter. Distribution inventory is at record lows. What we're shipping in, they're shipping out right away to meet their customers’ demand. So I don't anticipate it going up, but it's at very, very low historic levels, so I don't anticipate a large change.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: I've got a two part question that speaks to the supply demand imbalance that both Steve and Ganesh, you've talked about. I'm just kind of curious, on the supply side, we've seen a significant amount of consolidation in the semi industry over the last decade. You guys have been a big driver of that. I'm wondering, Steve or Ganesh, if you can comment on how that's impacting both yours and the industry's ability to actually grow supply? And then on the demand side, I'm just kind of curious, typically, when your demand is this strong, we're usually in an economy that's firing on all cylinders. And yet we're still -- have an economic backdrop, which is probably best described as under potential. And so if we go into the back half of the year, Steve, when we start to see a macro recovery, is there a real risk that supply shortages actually accelerate even further and why not get ahead of that with even more CapEx?
Ganesh Moorthy: So let me start on the supply side. If you look at our eight, 10 years of acquisitions that we have done and the consolidations from our perspective, the percentage of what we build, particularly from a fab standpoint, internal versus external, has changed. We used to have a higher percentage of it in our in house fabs. We're now down to about 39% of it is in house, the balance is down to the foundries. We obviously have a higher degree of control and ability to influence in a shorter period of time, the the capacity that we built in house than we do from a foundry standpoint. And so in that sense, that is something that has changed over this period of time. It has never been an issue until this cycle where the imbalance has been so large that the instantaneous response from foundry has been difficult. And a high percentage of what Microchip does through foundry is what foundry would consider to be the trailing edge of capacity they have. And that has also been not where all their investments have gone. They're making some but the majority of the investments have been in leading edge, which is where not a lot of our capacity requirements are into. Packaging and testing, we've been able to do more in house, and we've reported on the increases. We're now into the mid 50s as a percentage of our packaging that had been as low as in the high 30s and low 40s as a percentage. So there, as and when we can, we're going as fast as we can. We are looking at our capital investments and what do we need to be doing and how -- and a bit of this is finding the right mix between stepping on the accelerator where we have high confidence. PSP backlog, for example, gives us high confidence. And being a little more thoughtful where we have risk of putting a lot of capital in place and then perhaps having under absorbed capacity and that's always a judgment call. We make that every month, every quarter with what should our capital posture be. And we could yet change and have increased capital posture as we go into the second half of this year if that demand imbalance continues and persists at the level that it is. Steve, you want to add some more?
Steve Sanghi: Well, let me add to a little economic macro side of his question. So John what happened last year was that the biggest destruction of demand really was on the service side, the hospitality, hotels, the airlines, travel, restaurants, golf courses. Basically, the service side of the industry got decimated last year because of social distancing and all that. The manufacturing side didn't do that bad. I mean, there was really not a single quarter where our revenue even went down 10%. Most companies in the technology industry and manufacturing industry did reasonably well. Automotive was really bad for one quarter, but overall, not too bad. So now when you get to the recovery side of it, a fair amount of recovery is likely to take place on the service side, which got so decimated, restaurants and hotels, and airlines, and travel, and vacationers, and cruise lines and all that coming back. Now as they come back, and people have more money in their pocket with more jobs, certainly some of that money will flow to the hardware, electronics and cars and other things where our product goes, and we will benefit from it. But the big part of the upcoming surge is really going to be on the service side. Having said all that, I think demand is very strong now. And as you mentioned, when the economy picks up further steam with all these people coming back on the job, could it really even get more heated. The answer to that is it's definitely possible. But the other part of your question was, why not add more capital now. Well, we can't get it. I mean, we have so much capital on order and lead time is long. And some of the scheduled capital gets delayed by a month with a short notice because the supplier is also constrained. So it's not a question of what you can order. We're willing to order more. It's a question of what you can get. We can't get everything we want.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Ganesh, you talked about higher utilization rates utilization rates gross margins in the quarter. I'm curious what you saw from a pricing perspective in March relative to December. I was a little surprised how fast you were able to grow your microcontroller business and analog business on a sequential basis. So I'm guessing pricing played a role there. But if you can kind of speak to that, that would be super helpful. And then separately, assuming you guys managed to execute on the CapEx that you have planned today for the year, where do you see your internal capacity exiting the fiscal year versus where it is today?
Ganesh Moorthy: So first on the pricing front, we announced and we did raise prices in the March quarter. It wasn't in place for the entire quarter, but it was in place for a good amount of that quarter. And not all prices changed all at the same time. There are contractual requirements, different product lines and different things, but prices go up. With that, we also had costs go up that we were trying to offset with these price increases, and we continue to have increases coming through in our supply chain. So we think the price increases contributed some but was really not the major part of what drove our growth in the March quarter. Do you want to take the second part, Eric?
Eric Bjornholt: So the second part was on our, what our internal capacity can do in fiscal '22, which we're just entering. And I don't expect the fab mix to be much different. Last year, the year we just finished, we did 39% of our fab internally. I don't expect that mix to change. For fiscal '21, we did 53% of our assembly and 57% of our test in house. Those percentages should go up as we're continuing to invest and then bring some more capacity internal. But I don't have a specific number by the end of the year that's going to depend on what the demand environment is and how quickly we can respond with the CapEx.
Ganesh Moorthy: And some of the internal capacity takes time as it comes through and it may have an ongoing impact as we go into the next fiscal year.
Toshiya Hari: My question wasn't so much on the mix exiting the year. But again, assuming you guys do get all the tools that you're asking for and you manage to spend $250 million. How much higher could your internal capacity be in 12 months, is it 10%, 20%? A rough ballpark number would be super helpful.
Eric Bjornholt: I don't think that's a number we're willing to disclose. As Ganesh says, it takes time for that capacity to come on board at different stages. Something in fab is going to take longer than it might in assembly or test, and we're obviously not giving revenue guidance outside of the current quarter…
Steve Sanghi: There are too many corridors of capacity, both internally and externally, by process, by wafer size, by technology complexity. And somewhere, the capacity is being added, the other capacity is not being added. And to roll all that into just general number, our capacity goes of X percentage when we are not really sure from foundries what we can get. We know what we can do internally in terms of the capital we're adding. So I think that number is a complex one I'm not willing to share.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh: So just briefly, I know you mentioned shortages. Could you give us an idea of which segment you're seeing the highest shortages and where are things starting more kind of -- or getting to more normalize in terms of lead time?
Ganesh Moorthy: I think if you listen to the media, you would think that automotive is the only place where there are shortages and I think clearly, they've been the most vocal. Shortages are in every single segment that are taking place to varying degrees. And we do not see any segment starting to come back to some form of equilibrium where it is. So there are shortages and growing imbalances in every market segment we're in.
Vijay Rakesh: And I know you mentioned very strong backlog orders as you look at the June quarter here. Wondering as you look into the back half in terms of calendar Q3 and out, do you think -- are you expecting a better than seasonal outlook given how strong demand is and the pretty strong sign up on the PSP side as well?
Ganesh Moorthy: We talked earlier on about seasonality and all that. Right now, our revenue is not limited by the demand side of the equation. And often, seasonality speaks to where is the demand at and how does that come about. Our growth at this point is limited by how much can we manufacture and ship, and that's where all hands on deck are. So seasonality by itself is not as meaningful in the current environment.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach: I had a question on data center and comm, I mean, that's been an area that's been consolidating for a number of quarters. Just want to get a sense of what you're seeing in that market and if there's any visibility as to how you think it will trend as we go through the year.
Ganesh Moorthy: So we're not trying to provide guidance on how those are going to do by market segment as we go through the year. I think clearly, in the December quarter, we indicated to you that it seems to have bottomed out. That came to be the way the March quarter ended up, a slight bit of improvement from there. So we're quite optimistic about the data center segment, in particular, as we look into fiscal year '22. And then the communication sector has its own set of infrastructure rollouts that are taking place. But that's about as much as we're able to provide. We don't really track at the level of specificity with exact numbers. We have more of a directional statement, which is kind of what we've included in our conference call notes.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Raji Gill with Needham & Company.
Denis Pyatchanin: This is Denis here asking a question for Raji. I was wondering, could you speak about as far as these component supply constraints go up, which end markets are currently maybe kind of doing the best in terms of having some inventory available? And also, what proportion of these constraints is kind of on the front end or the back end?
Ganesh Moorthy: So there is no -- as I said in the earlier question, there is no end market in which there is available supply that's any better or not. They're all constrained to varying degrees. And so there's nothing from an end market to think. As far as back end and front end, we have constraints in both internal and external factories, in the back end and in the front end, in the material supply chain. And depending on what exact combination, what capacity corridor you're in, there might be more constraints and maybe less constrained, but they're all constrained.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David O'Connor from BNP Paribas.
David O'Connor: Maybe a follow up on the just and tying that, Steve, that you mentioned earlier. What changes do you foresee the level of inventories that the industry needs to hold? I mean, who in supply chain is going to be forced to carry more inventory, if that's the case and who is going to foot the bill for these higher inventories? If you could talk around that, how you see that, that would be great.
Ganesh Moorthy: Let me take a shot at that, and Steve may want to add to this as well. So I think what inventory people need to carry is going to have to be determined by the ultimate end market equipment manufacturers, the OEMs. And I think it can be very different in different product lines. When you build an $80,000 car and you're constrained by $10 of semiconductor content, the decision you may arrive there could be different from when you're building $200 consumer product that you have. So each industry, depending on the value of the product they're creating, the profitability of that industry, has to decide based on their experience, what is the inventory level that they need to assure themselves of the value of the product that they're trying to ship. And those answers are going to be different. I think some got burned quite badly. I suspect they will be the ones that want to do the most here. But there is not a single answer that comes with it. And as far as who foots the bill, ultimately, the manufacturer, the original equipment manufacturer, will foot the bill and more than likely have to pass that on in terms of what they're building to their end customer to the extent that they can. But if the choice is to invest in inventory, that is two, three orders of magnitude less than the value of the product that they're creating, many of them will have to rethink that equation of what kind of, just in time, makes sense for us. Steve, do you want to add to that?
Steve Sanghi: I don't really have a whole lot to add. But I would say that if you look at some of the Japanese car manufacturers did much better this time around, because they learned their lesson during the tsunami, and when a lot of the renaissance and other factories were shut down due to earthquake and radiations and all that. So they learned from that time and built a structure where they were not as much relying on JIT and reach the current time with a level of inventory on the semiconductor parts, and they did a lot better. And that's really the lesson the US and European auto manufacturers need to learn. And time would tell when the cycle goes the other way, is it all lost and it's just the same standoff, we don't really know. But they have to start thinking that building semiconductors is different than getting a bent metal for doorknob or something. Right now, we get some comments that are sometimes laughable, what's the big deal about lead frame, just bend the metal and make my parts, and it's just not that simple, building semiconductors. So I think a lot of learning needs to happen. And we don't directly ship the parts to the car manufacturers. We have the people in between like the Contis, and GenTechs, and Aptiv, and Hella and all these people. They're in between. So we have a buffer. But the car manufacturer really need to really take the bull by the horn and drive the process to get out of JIT. And I don't know whether they will, I don't know that.
Ganesh Moorthy: You know, a positive step is many of the carmakers have been at the forefront of embracing a PSP program and PSP program and requiring the Tier 1s to be . At least for the moment, you can see how we're trying to drive towards having a level of inventory that assures them they can build their very expensive or very highly valuable end products. How that will persist a year or two years from now, we don't know.
Operator: We'll move on to our next question from Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna.
Christopher Rolland: It's a little bit more open ended here, but, Ganesh, you said in 40 years, you haven't seen such an imbalance between supply and demand as acute as this one. And Steve, you may want to chime in here as well. But can you guys talk about maybe something that was similar, the number two most acute time or number three, and are there any analogies to this? And how did that eventually unwind where we had that match of supply and demand in DC, something like that taking place here?
Ganesh Moorthy: All cycles eventually come to an end as the participants in the battlefield work on how they adjust to where the situation is. In prior cycles, the semiconductor companies put in the additional capacity in place and began to get closer in their self interest to be able to grow. And the players in the market began to adjust with what they were building and how they were building. I would say in my timeframe, probably the sharpest rebound was probably 2008, 2009. And again, we were extremely fortunate in that time, because we did not shut down our factories and we kept things running and we grew our inventory. But not all people did that. And we know it did create dislocations as a result of doing that. Steve, do you want to add to that?
Steve Sanghi: Well, finishing your thought, in 2008, 2009, we didn't shut down our factory and continue to run the factories, although, we had some rotating time off. And then we entered the up cycle with a very good amount of inventory position. And through that, we grew a lot and we did very well. We didn't repeat that this time, because this time we had a very, very substantial debt leverage, which was very high. And therefore, we didn't choose to really put the money into inventory and kept the factories running and all that. At that time, I recall, investor concern was what happens if your demand goes down 35%, do you miss the covenant? So sometimes your memories can be short. But this environment presented different challenges, so we were not able to repeat the experience of 2009 and did not reach this time with a high inventory internally. And we're trying to build it now but unsuccessful because we're shipping as we build. The other point I wanted to make is people use this word double ordering. We don't really get double ordering because parts are all proprietary. You cannot buy from us and from another company for the same socket nor can two distributors ship the product into the same socket in the way we register and make it economically impossible for the nondesigning distributor to shift the part into that socket. So the only other remaining avenue is a customer orders a little more than what they need, which we never know and we cannot detect. If you want to call it double ordering, there could be some excess ordering by the customers we can't be sure of. But one thing we are sure of is there's no double fulfillment. We are in daily phone calls, escalation meetings with a number of customers, threatened line downs and actual lines down for many of the car manufacturers and others. There is no double fulfillment. People are -- everybody is getting a fraction of what they need. So therefore, there is a fair amount of runway ahead with such a large amount of demand. I think it's going to be the rest of the fiscal year, we're just trying to get our head above the water.
Ganesh Moorthy: And unlike prior cycles, right, we have noncancelable windows that are significantly longer than we have had in other cycles. And that puts a a lot more responsibility on the customer to have orders that they need and not orders that they don't need.
Operator: We'll take a follow-up question from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Let me ask another question. Just, Eric, on the target model, I'm just kind of curious on the gross margin line. What's been really impressive is the incremental margins you guys have been able to put up over the last, call it, six to eight quarters. I mean, on quarters where you've had sequential growth, I think incremental gross margins have been right around that 80% mark. And so was there something unusual about the last kind of six to eight quarters that drove such high incremental gross margins, and where should we think about that going forward?
Eric Bjornholt: Well, I think there's a couple of things. In the more recent quarters, we had significant underutilization charges, which have now gone away. So those costs are now being capitalized to inventory. We're running the factories more full, so that’s gone away. And then we had a large acquisition in Microsemi that we were integrating over that time frame, too, and finding ways to improve margins on the acquired business. Those are the two things that I would point to. Steve or Ganesh, anything else?
Ganesh Moorthy: The only other thing I would add is we continue to add value into many, many of our products through a combination of hardware and software, which makes them more valuable as improved the gross margins we have on those products. And as you then get to a weighted average of all these products and what are we doing to make them more valuable, it shows up in the aggregate gross margin.
Operator: And that does conclude today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ganesh Moorthy for any additional or closing remarks.
Ganesh Moorthy: We want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us. We do have investor meetings that are coming up that we look forward to meeting and talking to more of you. But have a good afternoon. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-02-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Microchip's Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead.
Eric Bjornholt: Thanks  and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric and good afternoon everyone. Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue performed well with revenue sequentially up 3.3%, as compared to the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our microcontroller revenue was up 5.9%.  We continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontroller solutions, including: the first safety certified capacitive touchscreen controllers for the home appliance market; the first Trust&GO Wi-Fi module delivering powerful 32-bit microcontroller functionality and verifiable identity; the industry's highest density secured Ethernet switching solution for hyperscale data centers and telecom service providers; and last but not least, three new broad market, 8-bit microcontroller families to extend our leadership in this product line. Microcontrollers overall represented 53.7% of our revenue in the December quarter. Moving to analog, our analog revenue also performed well and was sequentially up 3.1% as compared to the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our analog revenue was up 2.6%. During the quarter, we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products too, including the first cryptographic companion device supporting in-vehicle network security solutions, a new family of configurable 12-bit digital-to-analog converters, the first highly integrated radiation-hardened motor controller, and finally a family of low-latency PCI Express 5.0 and Compute Express Link retimers. Analog represented 27.6% of our revenue in the December quarter. Our FPGA revenue was down 8.5% sequentially, as compared to the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our FPGA revenue was up 7.1%. As we cautioned on our prior conference calls, FPGA revenue does have some lumpiness associated with them because of the large exposure to the aerospace and defense market and the associated purchasing patterns. During the quarter, we announced a radiation-hardened fourth-generation FPGA family and a low-power radiation-tolerant fifth-generation PolarFire FPGA family. FPGA represented 7.3% of our revenue in the December quarter. Our licensing memory and other product line, which we refer to as LMO was up 13% in revenue, as compared to the September quarter, with strength in licensing revenue driving this growth. LMO represented 11.4% of our revenue in the September quarter. A quick note about our product line reporting. Given the relatively smaller size of our FPGA product line at about 7% of our revenue, as compared to our microcontroller and analog product lines, we have decided that starting in calendar year 2021 we will no longer break out the FPGA product line separately. Our FPGA products remain important to our overall total system solutions goals.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2021. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021. The December quarter represented the shift of the business cycle back to revenue growth with a 3.3% sequential growth in a quarter where ordinarily, we would see 3% sequential decline from typical seasonal factors. December quarter revenue also grew over prior year’s December quarter by 5%. We started ramping our internal factories in September, as well as investing in capital additions to expand our internal capacity. We also started working with our supply chain partners to receive more allocation from wafer foundries and assembly test subcontractors. These efforts improved product availability in the December quarter, but still constrained to some of the revenue upside. We delivered a record non-GAAP gross margin of 63%, helped by a significant reduction in factory underutilization and better overhead utilization from revenue growth. We also achieved a non-GAAP operating margin of 39.8%, an all-time record and getting very close to and an emotional 40% mark. We also hit a record EBITDA of $593.4 million, despite revenue not yet a record, yet showing the robust strength of our business model. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, $0.05 above the mid-point of our guidance. This was also our 121st consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. Now, I will discuss our guidance for the March quarter. Our bookings were exceptionally strong in the December quarter and were an all-time record. We received bookings both for short-term as well as into the future quarters. The backlog is also an all-time record. Please remember that bookings, as well as the backlog is what is shippable in the next 12 months. The backlog for the March quarter is the strongest starting backlog I’ve ever seen. Our bookings have remained strong in January. On the operational side, the December quarter was constrained by product availability. We will have more internal and external capacity in the March quarter since we have had multiple months to ramp. Although, I believe that wafer fab, as well as back-end constraints are here to stay with us through calendar year 2021. In response to the business environment, we have taken three actions. First, in the middle of December, we changed our cancellation and pushed out terms with our customers and distributors. The standard terms used to be that an order cannot be canceled or pushed out once it is within 45 days of shipment. We changed our standard terms so that an order cannot be canceled or pushed out within 90 days of shipment effective January 1, 2021. We gave customers a couple of weeks to adjust their backlog before it went firm for 90 days. In response to our change in terms, we did not see any unusual cancellations or push-outs which indicates to us that the backlog was firm and needed by our customers. That gave us a solid backlog for the March quarter, which cannot be canceled or pushed out. Therefore, we can batch process the orders and use our manufacturing assets most efficiently, knowing that what we build will get shipped. The second action we took was that we sent a letter to our customers on January 4, 2021, informing them of the business environment. We also informed them that we are seeing broad-based cost increases and some aggressive commercial terms from our supplier base, and we must pass these cost increases to our customers through a broad-based price increase. The third action we took just this morning, we posted a letter on our website and sent it to our customers and distributors, announcing a new program called the Microchip Preferred Supply Program, or PSP. This program offers our customers the ability to receive prioritized capacity in the second half 2021 and first half 2022. The program has the following elements. The customers participating in this program will have to place 12 months of orders, which will be non-cancelable and non-reschedulable. The capacity priority will begin for shipments in July 2021. The program will not be a guarantee of supply. However, it will provide the highest priority for those orders which are under this PSP program. And the capacity priority will be on a first-come-first-served basis until the available capacity is booked. We will, of course, reserve a portion of our capacity for new customers, small long-tail customers, and new designs. We expect that a significant portion of our capacity will be booked under this new program with a large committed non-cancelable backlog for 12 months, Microchip will be in a stronger position to make capacity and raw material commitments to our suppliers by capital equipment with confidence, hire employees and ramp up manufacturing, and manufacture products more efficiently. Taking all these factors into consideration, we expect our net sales for March quarter to be up between 5% to 10% sequentially. The March quarter guidance at the mid-point would represent record GAAP net sales with the prior record being in the September quarter of 2018. The September quarter of 2018 based on GAAP sell-in revenue recognition was $1.432 billion. Some of you may still carry a sell-through base number of $1.513 billion for September 2018 in your historical financial model spreadsheets. The March quarter will also be limited by product availability on many product lines. Our guidance assumes working through a myriad of capacity constraints, qualifying incremental equipment installed, qualifying alternative subcontractors in some cases, and still dealing with a risk of production constraints with a new wave of COVID cases plaguing the planet, and at the same time, ramping of vaccinations. For the March quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 63.3% and 63.7% of sales, which would be a new all-time record. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 23.2% and 23.6% of sales, and we expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 39.7% and 40.5% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.67 per share to $1.79 per share. We also expect to pay down another approximately $350 million of our debt in the March quarter. Finally, I want to cover one other area, which is our future cash return strategy. At the rate we’re paying down debt, we expect to break and net  within a year and continue to decrease from there. At that time, we expect to begin distributing more of our substantial amount of free cash flow to the investors in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. Regarding buybacks, through multiple tranches of convertible debt buyback, we have essentially bought a substantial amount of stock back from the future. This is because as the stock price rises and exceeds the conversion price of the debt, convertible debt dilutes the share count  back prevents future dilution as the stock price rises. Our first convert buyback was in March 2020 when Microchip stock price was about $71. Since then, we have done four other buyback transactions at various stock prices. By doing these various buyback transactions, we have purchased a total of $3.525 billion in face value of our convertible bonds. For the transactions from March 2020 to September 2020, we issued a total of about 20.4 million shares of our common stock to the investors for in the money value of their bonds. If these bonds have remained outstanding until an assumed stock price of $140 per share, the stock price about now, the dilution would have been about 26.4 million shares. Thus our repurchases had the impact of creating a savings of about 6 million shares worth $840 million savings to our investors at $140 per share. This calculation does not include our November 2020 transaction, which was very recent and executed at 133.47 per share, so it is not yet accretive. Therefore, while we have not done any open-market stock buybacks in the last year, our convert transactions have had the impact of a buyback of approximately 6 million shares. At some point in the future, we expect to start pure stock buyback from the open market. We are also initiating a path to higher dividends and not waiting until our leverage, which is a given number before the dividend starts to increase. In this regard, we announced today that the Board of Directors have approved a dividend increase of 5.8% sequentially to $0.39 per share, up from $0.3685 previously. We expect to continue to increase dividends quarterly as part of our cash return strategy. Given all of the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis, except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we expect that the analysts – and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. With this, , will you please poll for questions?
Operator: Certainly.  And we'll take the first question at this time. Caller, please go ahead.
Steve Sanghi: Not able to hear you, maybe you are on mute.
Unidentified Analyst: Steve, can you hear me?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, now.
Unidentified Analyst: Apologize. I didn’t hear my name get called. Just heard caller. Apologize for that. Just really quickly, we've lived through multiple times of you sending out customer letters. And we kind of have an understanding of how the market responds to that, I'd be kind of curious, the preferred supplier agreement that you talked about in your opening remarks, is this the first time that you have done that? And if it's not, what's been the historical response to programs like this?
Steve Sanghi: So, the preferred supplier program is brand new. I have not ever implemented it in my 42 years of career, and I have never seen anybody else do that too. The program is largely a response to the current environment, because bookings level is just so strong and people are booking parts out in time. The industry seems to be, you know, 30% plus sure to really what the capacity requirement is. And many of our customers have been asking, you know, what can they do if they give us longer-term demand, longer-term orders, you know, will that give them parts, will that give them better support? Now, you know, customers can give us longer-term orders, but if the orders cancellable or reschedule, you know, after 90 days, which was the case prior to the program, then I could have a lot of orders for September and December and could buy capital, hire people to rent but just before I get there, people could cancel, if there was a double ordering, people were asking more than they need, and they cancel part of the orders. So there is often the problem always and you guys ask the question, is there any double ordering or whatever. And in this program, basically, eliminates all that. It asks the customers to place 12 months of backlog, which will be non-cancelable, . So, I can take that one to the bank, buy raw material, do batch processing, grow the capacity and give them preferential supply. So, this is the first time we have implemented. It’s just a need of the times.
Unidentified Analyst: And I know it was just this morning, but what do you expect the intended response to be from your customers?
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know, small number of customers, you already have feedback through the day, including a couple of distributors, their response is positive. They will place such orders, you know, I don't expect any customer to place their entire backlog on every product on the PSP program, because customers themselves have some programs where they're solid, that the demand is good, they have a good market share on that particular design. But some others could be some new programs where the demand is yet not known. So, I think customers will really take a lot of the product and put it on  and some others that they want.
Unidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thank you guys.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: We’ll take the next question. It comes from Toshiya Hari. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Steve and Ganesh, given the current supply and demand situation, what are your thoughts on pricing across your microcontroller and analog business and if you can kind of speak to gross margins on the back of that, that will be helpful. And I guess, sort of related to that, given the preferred supplier program, how should we think about the economics of that program? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: So, you know, we sent a letter to our customers on January 4, really informing them, first of the business environment and also informing them that we were seeing broad based cost increases and some very aggressive commercial terms from other suppliers who were facing similar issues from their suppliers really up and down the supply chain. And we must pass these cost increases to our customers through really a broad based price increase. So after writing that letter then we need to really develop that program and we got, you know, several hundred thousand skews and going through the price increase on, you know, on which part and how much and passing on to the customers working through their contracts and long-term prices and stuff like that. So, all that really has been implemented at this point in time. We're in breaking out, you know, what portion of the guidance is price increase, you know, that's going to be relatively difficult, but the price increases have already been made effective.  As far as the economics of the PSP program, the economics of the PSP programs really are in having a committed non-cancelable, non-reschedule level backlog on the books that we can build it in batches by raw material ahead if we wanted, you know, increase the inventory if we wanted to serve that and build it whenever we have a , essentially, that's why the economics are, to be able to serve the customers better who joined the program, and Microchip not be subject to ordering more than they need and double ordering because they're not going to double order and order more than they need if they cannot reschedule or cancel. So that's where the economics are. There’s no price change with that price program is totally separate.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: I don’t know if that answers your question.
Toshiya Hari: Thanks.
Operator: We'll take the next question that comes from Vivek Arya. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya: Yes, go ahead. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, you use this phrase, significant revenue growth in calendar 2021, and you're starting the year at about 10% year-on-year growth. Is that a significant number, is it something higher than that? And more importantly, what kind of growth can your supply chain support this year?
Steve Sanghi: I know, you must have noted what I said, I thought I talked about – the question really was that, you know, Street had 7% growth, do you expect something higher than that? And my answer was yes. So, you know whatever – anybody interpreted, I don't know what significant means. And I can't really give you a number for the growth for the year although I think the revenue is more constrained by capacity than the demand, at least now and for the next several quarters, which leads to your second question, what kind of growth the supply chain support? I think one of the problems that we're dealing with is that the supply chain is not as stable. You know, we're finding that, you know,  subcontractor will commit that they can do X number of parts per week. And as we get there, they would change that number, they would lower that number or push it out by a couple of weeks. Well, what happened? Well, what happened was they got a  from their supplier. They didn’t get some bundles they were expecting. They couldn't hire some people, somebody tested positive for COVID. So they had to send 50 people home, who had come in contact with it. So, you know there is no slack in the system. Everything that gets built, get shipped, there's absolutely no slack in the system. So, any perturbation, there was an earthquake in Taiwan, we had a car that hit our substation in fab in Oregon that knocked out about three or four days, partial knockout, not complete. You know, none of those things are makeable, because all factories are working seven days a week, you know, full board. So, any delay in equipment, just leads to a de-commitment. So, I think those are all the myriad of problems we're dealing with, in adding equipment, adding people, qualifying additional subcontractors, getting our customers to waive qualification. You know, automotive are the hardest customers to qualify production in a different plant or to approve a change. And in the last six months, we have been so successful in getting even all the automotive customers that they would buy the product from this alternative assembly site, a test site or all that. So, we're getting help in that area. But it's still a very, very complicated, you know, process to put it all together. And therefore, we're not willing to dollarize the number or what percentage we could grow. Not yet.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take the next question that comes from Craig Hettenbach. Please go ahead.
Craig Hettenbach: Yes, thank you. Just a question on  inventory at 26 days, you know, when would you expect that to perhaps get back to kind of within normal ranges and any trends you could share just by geography in terms of ?
Steve Sanghi: You know, distribution would love to grow the inventory in this environment to serve the customers better. But, you know, the  can't grow, there isn't – it's not enough product available to grow the inventory, because product keeps getting shipped out. Another point I would like to make is that our inventory, as well as distributor inventory is calculated based on last 90 days of sales. So, it's based on the prior quarter. So, essentially, you know, if you – the real value of the inventory is to support the future. So, if you take our guidance and take the mid-point of that guidance, let's say, and calculate the days of distributor inventory, or Microchip inventory, based on that guidance, then the inventory numbers are extremely low. But they are calculated as we report which is a standard convention based on the past 90 days. In a very stable environment flat sales it doesn't matter, but in a significant growth, the real inventory is actually much lower than the numbers were reporting, and we don't think it's going to grow. I think our internal inventory will drop this quarter. We expect by several days and distribution will do the same.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. And then just a follow-up for Ganesh on the total system solution, any progress there or things you can share with us in terms of developments?
Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So, you know, it's not a one-quarter progress. It's a multi-quarter activity that we've had. The processes that need to be put in place have been there. The process of going in, is reflected in how we see the design activity taking place, some of which we've shared anecdotally and some of the conferences we will share some more this coming quarter as well. But I think the power of the whole coming together, putting all the different parts of Microchip on a customer's board is very much strong and alive and a key part of our growth strategy.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take the next question that comes from Gary Mobley. Please go ahead.
Gary Mobley: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So, I know you started the December quarter with your distributor inventory levels slightly below average, and looks like you under shipped into the channel by about 26 million in the December quarter, is that how we should think about perhaps what, you know, how much higher your revenue could have been, if you had, you know, available, you know, production capacity and whatnot, a similar amount, as we look out into the march quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know, we, we had unsupported orders, for every geography, for every product line, for direct as well as for distribution. So, just picking a number that the distribution inventory went down by – and just seeing, you know, that's the revenue we missed for the December quarter will not be accurate. We're not breaking up the number, but the total amount of revenue that we missed also was also from direct and essentially in every geography.
Gary Mobley: Okay. As my follow up, I wanted to ask about your philosophy towards M&A when you get to that magical net leverage ratio of less than 3 x, is that, should we take that to mean that you're also open to some M&A transactions at that point, as well?
Steve Sanghi: I think we have spoken extensively about this in the past saying that we believe, you know, there was an era of M&A, as you know, in the last 12 years or so we did 16, 17, 18 acquisitions, a few large ones public and lots of them small private and all that was intent to, you know, scale the company, you know, 10 x or so, and now we're over $5.4 billion company, and really not have a scale disadvantage to our competitors. I think we have achieved that. And today, we have a product line with which we can complete a customer's entire solution and essentially have all the parts built out of Microchip products and other than  and connectors and battery, everything else is really made from Microchip. So, today, there is not, you know, that need for M&A and no . So, we are really building a strategy going forward on organic growth built from really large amount of success in providing total system solutions to the customers. It could be a tuck-in acquisition here and there, you know, private, smaller or really buying some people, which is a, you know, technology pipeline or something like that, but there is really no plan currently for doing any kind of large acquisition even after we reach a certain leverage.
Gary Mobley: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take the next question that comes from Chris Caso. Please go ahead.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. The first question is about some of the capacity additions that you're undertaking now, could you talk about one the direction of CapEx over the next couple of quarters as you try to address these – some of these supply constraints? How long does it take to, you know, get the capacity in place? And then lastly, you know, to what extent are you looking to address these constraints through internal means, as opposed to, you know, getting them through outsourcing? What's going to be the quicker and more sustainable path to getting some more product to your customers?
Steve Sanghi: Eric, you want to take the CapEx question?
Eric Bjornholt: Sure, sure. So, we've indicated that in the very short-term, for the March quarter, we're expecting to stand between $50 million and $60 million in CapEx. We've kind of given general guidance to the Street, the longer-term, we expect our CapEx as a percentage of net sales to be somewhere between 3% and 4%. You know, this quarter we’ll be going through our annual operating plan for our next fiscal year and will provide kind of a more detailed forecast in fiscal 2022. But I wouldn't be surprised if we're on the high end of that range for next fiscal year. We’ve been well below it for the last two fiscal years and so quite clear  environment is driving that. And I'll start with the second piece of the question. And Steve or Ganesh can add on to it, but you know, we have been making significant investments, and assembly and test expansion. And actually, this last quarter, we did 65% of our assembly in-house that's up significantly quarter-on-quarter. And we did 57% of our final test in-house. So, you know, these metrics tend to be slow moving, but we are making progress on that, and is allowing us to take a little bit more control of our own destiny. So, with that, I'll turn it back to Steve.
Steve Sanghi: So, I think one of your questions implies that, what portion of the CapEx we were spending for internal versus external, I think 100% of our CapEx is really being applied to grow the capacity internally. The external capacity growth, we're getting it just by getting larger allocation and negotiating for a larger piece of the total capacity pie at foundries and subcontractors. We're not really spending our CapEx dollars in growing their capacity, but our capacity is growing significantly, outside also. But overall, as Eric mentioned, you know, especially in the assembly and test area, a large portion of capacity growth is happening inside.
Chris Caso: All right. As a follow up, you know, given the strongly better than seasonal March, the fact that you've got, you know, backlog that that's difficult to fill all of that, you know, how do we think about seasonality through the rest of the year, and they're always difficult questions right now, but, you know, any kind of qualitative comments that you can provide would be helpful.
Steve Sanghi: I think seasonality has been difficult to define for Microchip for some time because of all the acquisitions, and especially with Microsemi, the end market mix changed so much that we said, you know, if you got a year or two years of stable environment, then one could figure out what the seasonality would be. And we haven't gotten that stable environment. First for the U.S. China trade, and last year was COVID. And this year is this runaway growth, our capacity constraint. So, in this environment, it's not the seasonal factor that's changing what you can or cannot do. It's a combination of how much capacity you can grow what the overall demand is. So, I can't really comment much on seasonality in this kind of environment. 
Chris Caso: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take the next question. It comes from Harlan Sur. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe as a follow up to the last question, I know the difficulties and complexities in quantifying full-year of revenue generation potential, but maybe more near term, you know, I assume that the team is almost fully booked for the June quarter, maybe you guys can confirm that. And that would include any unshipped delinquencies from March. And June, you know, we could argue, you know about seasonality, but typically June is up sequentially. So, your  requirements are probably already fixed for June, given the lead time of some of your foundry partners, but wondering if you guys would be able to bring on, you know, and qualify additional wafers in assembly and test capacity in time to support higher levels of revenues from where you are here in March, if it plays out that way in June?
Steve Sanghi: So, you can’t qualify different fabs in a matter of three months or six months. You know, depending on what the process and products are to you, it's a much longer effort. So, a lot of the capacity growth is really coming out of, you know, growing capacity where the processes are already installed. You know, we got some processes that are installed outside, as well as inside. And most of the other majority of our processes either run outside or an inside and when they run outside, they usually only either run in one foundry or the other foundry. So, there's really no process that runs in three or four different foundries. They may run in three or four different fabs of the same foundry. You know, like take TSMC, it could run in three different fabs of TSMC, but it doesn't run in TSMC, as well as global, as well as UNC or something. So, the capacity growth is largely coming from where the processes are already installed, from a fab standpoint. From an assembly test standpoint, yes, we're qualifying additional alternate assembly subcontractors which could give additional capacity. But there also, majority of the growth in assembly, as well as test is coming from buying capital and installing in three of microchips large facilities, two in Thailand, and one in Philippines. They are basically doing record amount of assembly and test every day. And capacity is rising, every week, every month, every quarter for the rest of the year.
Harlan Sur : So, I guess my question is…
Eric Bjornholt: A second comment there from, Harlan talking about or kind of implying that June quarter is fully booked, and you know that is not the case. June quarter isn't fully booked, the March quarter isn't fully booked, it can be fully booked on certain products. And you maybe are going to ask and expand on that a little bit.
Steve Sanghi: Yeah, I mean, you know, even for this quarter, we have strong backlog. But we have some turns we have to pay. And there's turns to pay for the June quarter. As Eric mentioned, there are certain product lines, which can be much closer to being booked up. And that's typically, you know, it is starting at a much higher backlog than a normal quarter would be, but there is still work to be done and there is capacity coming online, which will help with some of the growth, both that's helping this quarter, as you can see this December and some more into June.
Harlan Sur: Okay. So you answer my – well that was going to be my third question or what was my third question in that which is, irrespective of how the demand plays out, you know, if June quarter backlog ends up suggesting a higher June quarter, you guys would have the capabilities in place foundry or internal to drive higher revenue levels sequentially in the June quarter? 
Steve Sanghi: Absolutely, yes.
Harlan Sur: Okay. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: You’re welcome.
Steve Sanghi: You’re welcome.
Operator: We'll take the next question at this time. It comes from Ambrish Srivastava. Please go ahead.
Ambrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you. One the near-term, and then I have a longer-term, Steve, and really just wanted to make sure I understood that part. On the near-term, the Preferred Supply Program you started just this morning. But does the guide for March, does it include the change in cancellation from 45 days to 90 days? Is that part of – has that been implemented long enough to reflect in the March guide?
Steve Sanghi: So that was told to the customers in early December or maybe it was the middle of December, around maybe 8th or 10th December. And we gave them then the following three weeks or so to make any changes to the backlog they wanted to make, and on January 1, the backlog will go hard for the 90 days. So – and there were very few changes made. There were just meaningless very small changes. So, as of January 1, then whatever was on our books for the March quarter, it became firm with no changes to be made. And that backlog position for the March quarter was very strong, strongest we have ever seen in our careers. Now as Ganesh answered earlier, and Eric answered, that doesn’t mean the March quarter was fully booked because you always have products where this product available and customers and distributors can continue to come and buy those products for the lead time is still fairly short and shippable within the quarter. But a very large number of products were also completely booked and nothing available for March, and some products even nothing available for June. So, the impact of that 90 days was effective on January 1.
Ambrish Srivastava: Got it.
Steve Sanghi: And then as you go, as you finish the month of January, then the backlog is now hard for February, March, April. By the end of February, the backlog will be hard for March, April, and May. So that was the 90-day program. The PSP program is an entirely new program. The 90-day program was applicable to all customers worldwide, direct or distribution. The PSP program is a customer adoption. It’s not – we can’t force them to give us one year of backlog, so that was an option given to the customer, so they can have an ability to get preferred supply support if they would give us 12 months of non-cancelable backlog, which helps us in bringing capacity online and buy capital and hire people with confidence, and it gives them preferential capacity. So, there is something in it for both.
Ambrish Srivastava: Got it.
Eric Bjornholt: Just want to make sure this is clear – I want to make sure this is clear that has zero impact on the March quarter.
Ganesh Moorthy: Or the June quarter, for that matter.
Ambrish Srivastava: Got it.
Steve Sanghi: Yes. The preferential, just .
Ambrish Srivastava: Yeah, I understand. I just want to make sure…
Steve Sanghi: The PSP program support starts from July. Now, the order, they can replace it now for 12 months. But if they come up with a whole bunch of new orders for March, April, May, June, they can’t get the supply ripped off from other people who have placed the backlog before. So, PSP capacity support does not begin till July.
Ambrish Srivastava: Got it. I wasn’t confused about PSP. I just wanted to make sure that the March quarter is – it sounds like you were able to pull together a lot of internal and external to guide to what you did, and it also has some back – or some solidity, I lack of a better word, because of the 90 days that you started in December. That’s what I wanted to understand because there is a concern about double booking, but sounds like the way you have framed it and the way you’re running the business at this point seems like you have quite a lot of visibility on that.  My longer-term question, Steve, and thanks for addressing that. Your business model is transforming and you have been talking about M&A being less of a priority given where the valuations are and focus on organic. So, the question – and you addressed it by saying the buyback, even though not directly, you have been bringing down dilution. What was the point you made on dividend? I missed that. What’s the formula that you have in place for dividend growth?
Steve Sanghi: We don’t really have a formula in place. We just – Board will meet every quarter and decide the dividend for every quarter. In the current quarter, we grew the dividend by 5.8%, and you couldn’t expect that Board will grow the dividend every quarter. And that’s really our commitment. I told in the last couple of quarters that we would build a glide path towards higher dividend, and this is a glide path towards a higher dividend. So, if you cumulate the increase in dividend for four, five, six quarters, then by the middle of 2022, you already would have a significantly higher dividend after seeing fixed increases of the kind we just did. That’s really what we’re trying to do to get to higher dividends, and by that time, leverage would have come down and such – that higher dividend will really be supportable at that point in time both – from the cash flow, and still have enough cash available to keep bringing the debt down further.
Ambrish Srivastava: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take the next question that comes from Chris Danely from Citi. Please go ahead.
Chris Danely: Hey, thanks, guys. I guess just a little bit of color on the capacity constraints and shortages. So, Steve, you talked about it being in the automotive, industrial and consumer sectors or end-markets. Most of your competitors are just saying, automotive. Would you expect this to spread to those other end-markets for your competitors and other folks in semis? And then when do you remember these shortages being this bad? Do we have to go back to like 2010 or 2000?
Steve Sanghi: I do not remember shortages being this bad ever. So, this is just like – this is a Six Sigma event in terms of shortages, call it a Black Swan event, although that’s more meant for negative. I don’t really know what other competitors are seeing what, but our capacity for automotive products and industrial products and consumer products is really common. It runs at the same fabs, the same processes, sometimes they have the same parts that we can ship into an automotive or ship into an industrial. So, the capacity constraints would really be shared by all markets. Now, the largest increase in demand has been in automotive, wherein the June quarter, automotive demand went to 20% of normal because all the factory shut down. And as that demand has gone back to 95% of normal or 100% of normal, that’s 5x increase in auto demand. So, they are seeing sort of there were shortages, because they didn’t place their orders, they didn’t really guide towards having this stronger V-shape recovery, so their  are worse than that, but the capacity is common.
Chris Danely: Okay. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: There is also a fact that in automotive, $1 part can prevent a $40,000 car from shipping. In industrial, $1 part could just prevent 1,999 power drill from that shipping. So the hurt factor is quite different, so therefore the noise from automotive and the escalations of the management team and the pressure and all that is really of a different level.
Operator: We’ll take the next question that comes from Harsh Kumar. Please go ahead.
Harsh Kumar: Yeah. Hey, guys, first of all, congratulations on the tremendous guide, I guess, just a sign of what you’re seeing. And Steve, I had two , I wanted to go back to what Harlan was talking about earlier. As you get over year supply issues, let’s say whether it’s June or July, am I incorrect in thinking based on your kind of what you mentioned in the press release of having a very strong year? As you are able to supply, should we not expect the second half that is better or stronger? Or help me think about linearity from here. And then for Eric, the question is on gross margin. If I’m not mistaken, you’re at your target or very close to it. With no M&A, would there not be a  to think about that gross margin as you get more and more efficient?
Steve Sanghi: So, I think taking the question of capacity, you mentioned somehow that we catch up by June, July. We don’t expect to catch up on demand capacity balance for the balance of the calendar year 2021, and could possibly go into 2022. I mean we already know that the demand on lots and lots of products succeeds where we have no product available. If you place an order today, we were shipping here in September, October. And people are booking September, October, November, fast. And with the PSP program, we’re going to get backlog all the way through next January, February. So, I don’t think the capacity issue is getting solved in the next four, five, six months. I think we’re talking a 12-month at least to solve that – to really have the capacity get in balance. And I don’t remember the other part of your question for Eric.
Harsh Kumar: The other one was gross margin.
Eric Bjornholt: Yeah. I’ll take the gross margin question. So, we did actually update our long-term targets for gross and operating margin back in December. We took the gross margin target to 65% and the operating margin target to 42%. So, we essentially achieved what was our prior target of 63% on the gross margin with the last quarter results, and are guiding at the midpoint to about 63.5% this quarter. So, gross margin was absolutely going to highlight over the last couple of years, and we’re continuing to do all the right things to be efficient in our operations to drive improvements. And I’m not sure if you have more follow-up on that, but we definitely have outlined five or six things that are going to help us continue to make improvement on gross margin into the future, and we can go through that separately if you’d like, Harsh.
Harsh Kumar: I appreciate the clarification, Eric. I’m good. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take the next question that comes from Janet Ramkissoon. Please go ahead.
Janet Ramkissoon: Yeah. Nice creativity, guys with this new program. I was going to ask a question about the margins as well. It just seems to me that if you have a lot of visibility and you could procure supplies in a more timely and efficient manner, and you just plan better generally speaking, as you go – as you exit 2021, you should be in a position where you would hit those target margins – you could hit those targets margins a lot sooner. Am I correct in thinking that, Steve or is there something I’m missing?
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know the PSP program doesn’t really do anything to the margin, and historically it could make us more efficient if we get a large amount of backlog, lots and lots of customers pick up on that offer, and then we can build the product more efficiently. It could help a little bit on the cost side of the equation. But PSP program wasn’t launched to drive margins. It was launched to get a firm customer backlog that we can be confident of growing our capacity and not have any double ordering or excess ordering in that backlog, which could go away when we get there. That’s why it was launched. It was not launched for margin. And I don’t think it’s going to have a lot of impact on margin. Now, as we are growing through this growth period, you have three or four things happening. Number 1, all the underutilization is going away. Most of it has gone away in March, but some could be going away in June. Number 2, as the incremental capacity is being added, the incremental capacity usually is more productive because you’re not adding the entire – every machine, you’re adding bottlenecks here and there. So, when you add debt capacity, the incremental margin through and for every dollar of revenue tends to be better, and if you go back in the prior cycles and calculate incremental margin to get some idea. The third being, we are bringing some products, both in fab and assembly and test from outside to inside, and those moves are accretive, there could be something else. The impact of price increase, I think is going to be relatively benign because we largely launched that to offset the cost increases. But you can’t always increase the price on a product. We have seen the cost increase. We got to look at the product whether there is a competitive element there or it’s a proprietary product, so the price increase and cost increase don’t completely match product-by-product. But overall, we might get some benefit and certainly in revenue, probably not in margin.
Janet Ramkissoon: That’s very helpful. Thanks very much. Great quarter.
Steve Sanghi: You are welcome.
Operator: We’ll take the next question at this time. It comes from Denis Pyatchanin. Please go ahead.
Denis Pyatchanin: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I’m here to ask a question on behalf of Raji Gill. Is there any chance you could provide us with some more color on the various, kind of end-market gross margins, kind of how do those move throughout the last quarter? So, you know, if you maybe you can break it out by your reporting segment?
Eric Bjornholt: We don’t break out gross margin either by end market or by product line. So, we reported at the company level and that’s all we have.
Denis Pyatchanin: I see. And as a follow-up, how do you expect kind of the recent investments into the internal capacity to impact your margins over the next three quarters? Would you say that there is going to be a noticeable impact of the internal capacity coming online? And has that been factored into your guidance? Or do you expect that to maybe hit towards the – kind of the end of the calendar year?
Steve Sanghi: So, I think – go ahead.
Eric Bjornholt: No, I was going to say, I think these come on slowly. They’re not going to make big quarter-to-quarter changes in what they’re at. Directionally, each of them is a small step in the roadmap that we have said we want to improve our gross margins through the long-term target. But I would not be looking for quarter-by-quarter. These are making big changes in the gross margin of the company overall.
Denis Pyatchanin: I see. And that was all. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take the next question that comes from Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Christopher Rolland: Thanks for the question, guys. Just two quick ones from me and then I’ll get off. I guess, Steve, first of all, PSP. Ultimately, what percent of revenue do you expect to go through the PSP program versus other? And then secondly, as you bring some internal capacity home, even on the wafer side, does this bring up a conversation about a 300-millimeter fab or not? Is that – at what point does that become of interest to Microchip?
Steve Sanghi: So, I think the first part of your question, what portion of the revenue we expect to go through PSP, we really have no idea. It’s never been done before. It is being launched by taking on questions from many large customers saying, what can you do to make sure I get capacity support in the second half. I’m delinquent now, you’re not giving me everything I need, so how can I ensure that I get that in the future? And so, we came up with this program and saying if you commit that your orders for that next 12 months and non-cancelable and non-reschedulable then we will go with confidence, bill that product and give you preferential support. So, we do not know what the uptake would be and we’re just purely guessing. We just launched it this morning, and have gotten three or four inputs since then, one from a major distributor and few from customers. One customer, I had talked to personally. So, I think this is the heart of the . So that’s that. The other part of your question was the 300 millimeter. There is no plan to do any 300 millimeter inside. And we continue to have two large 8-inch fabs and one large 6-inch fab and a number of small 4-inch sort of fabs that we are transitioning product away from those 4-inches to a 6-inch and 8-inch fabs. The 12-inch capacity continues to be at our foundries for any foreseeable future.
Christopher Rolland: Thanks, guys.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time, and that ends our question-and-answer session for today. I’d now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sanghi. Please go ahead.
Steve Sanghi: Yeah. I want to thank everyone for attending the call. Also want to say that this is my last call as CEO. As many of you know, Ganesh Moorthy would be the CEO starting March 1. I would still attend the call. I will stay engaged with investors, but Ganesh will take the lead role. And if some of you are expecting to find a softer version of Steve, you may not get that. Internally, he is  than I am, but we’ll see externally how Ganesh acts. So, thank you all. Bye-bye.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2020-11-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to Microchip's Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Financial Results. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Microchip's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Please go ahead, sir. 
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
 In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO; and Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's CFO. I will first comment on our CEO transition and Board appointments. Eric will then comment on our second quarter financial performance. And Ganesh will then give his comments on the results. I will then discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
 So let me begin by commenting on the CEO transition announced today and the addition of Board members. Today, we announced that I will transition to an Executive Chair role effective March 1, 2021. Microchip's current President, Ganesh Moorthy, will step into the role of President and CEO effective March 1, 2021. Ganesh will also join the Board of Directors effective January 4, 2021.
 I joined Microchip in February 1990 as Senior Vice President of Operations and was promoted to President to lead this company in July 1990. Microchip then had sales of about $60 million, and it was losing about $10 million per year. The main product line at that time was commodity e-comm, and the gross margin of the company was about 30%. The turnaround of the company was documented in my book, Driving Excellence: How the Aggregate System Turned Microchip from a Failing Company to a Market Leader. We took Microchip public in March of 1993, with annual sales of $89 million and a market capitalization of $85 million. In the last 27 years as a public company, Microchip's net sales grew to $5.2 billion, and its market capitalization grew to approximately $30 billion.
 Today, Microchip produces industry-leading gross and operating margins. Since its IPO, Microchip's stock price has grown approximately 20,000%, excluding dividends. Microchip has also completed its 120th consecutive quarter of profitability on a non-GAAP basis. In the last 30 years, Microchip transformed from a small company focused on nonvolatile memory products, to an embedded solutions powerhouse with a broad and innovative range of solutions as well as leadership positions in the industrial, data center, automotive, communications, consumer and aerospace and defense markets.
 We have also been an industry consolidator, having acquired about 20 companies, including well-known industry names like Silicon Storage Technology, Standard Microsystems, Micrel, Atmel and Microsemi. All of the acquired companies were successfully integrated into Microchip's business and created outstanding value for the stockholders of Microchip.
 Leading Microchip for the last 30 years has been the greatest privilege of my 42 years in the semiconductor industry. I turned 65 in July of this year. I often thought about transitioning to an Executive Chair role by that date. I discussed this with our Board of Directors as part of our succession planning process earlier this year, but no decision was made at that time. Then given the unexpected COVID-19 pandemic, the Board and I thought it was best to delay any transition so that it would not occur during a very turbulent and unpredictable time. I have now decided that the time is right to make this change. The overall decision was made easier given that Microchip has someone as qualified as Ganesh to assume the CEO role and given the strength of the rest of our management team.
 I have known Ganesh for 39 years since hiring him as a new college graduate at Intel in 1981. He has a demonstrated track record of success. And our proven partnership over the last 19 years at Microchip makes him my logical successor. He is an energetic, articulate and thoughtful leader who is widely respected amongst our customers, partners, suppliers, investors and analysts as well as the entire Microchip employee base. Ganesh joined Microchip in 2001 and served as the vice president of multiple business units. In 2006, he was promoted to Executive Vice President, with extended business unit and manufacturing responsibilities, and assumed the role of Chief Operating Officer in 2009. Ganesh has served as President and Chief Operating Officer from February 2016. Since then, Ganesh and I had jointly led Microchip. Now starting March 1, 2021, Ganesh will become the President and CEO of Microchip. I will remain as an Executive Chairman. I will work with Ganesh to continue to drive the strategic direction of this company and maintain a strong culture and succession planning that we have developed here.
 We also announced today that starting January 4, 2021, Karen Rapp will join the Board of Directors of Microchip and will also join its Audit Committee. Karen is no stranger to the technology investment community. She's currently the CFO of National Instruments. She also serves on the Board of Plexus, which is a contract manufacturer. Karen brings with her extensive large company -- large public company experience and significant leadership accomplishments in financial management, financial governance, information technology and cybersecurity. We are all very pleased to have Karen join our Board.
 I will now pass this call to Eric Bjornholt, and he will cover the earnings part of this conference call. Eric? 
J. Bjornholt: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website.
 We will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.
 Net sales in the September quarter were $1.31 billion, which was flat sequentially and above the high end of our narrowed guidance range from September 9, 2020, when net sales were expected to be down between 2% and 6% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales as well as end market demand by product line and geography on our website for your reference.
 On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were very strong and near record levels at 62.2%. Operating expenses were at 23%. And operating income was an outstanding 39.2%, all better than the high end of our revised guidance from September 9. Our factory underutilization charges decreased from $13.9 million to $12.2 million sequentially as we started to ramp our factories to respond to the stronger-than-expected business conditions. We expect the continued ramp of our factories to lead to lower underutilization charges in the December quarter.
 Non-GAAP net income was $416.4 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.56, $0.15 above the midpoint of our guidance and $0.10 above the high end of our guidance from September 9. On a GAAP basis in the September quarter, gross margins were 61.7% and include the impact of $6 million of share-based compensation expense.
 Total operating expenses were $581.7 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $232.9 million, special charges of $4.3 million, $0.7 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $43.7 million. The GAAP net income was $73.6 million or $0.27 per diluted share.
 Our September quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, including tax reserve releases associated with the statute of limitations expiring, offset by tax reserve accruals associated with developments of the Altera court case during the period, deferred tax impacts of enacted changes in tax law occurring during the period, deferred tax impacts of our convertible debt exchange transactions occurring during the period and other matters. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 5% in the September quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '21 to be about 5.5%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.
 We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as U.S. interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The remaining cash tax payments associated with the transition tax are expected to be about $221 million and will be paid over the next 5 years. We have posted the schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website.
 Our inventory balance at September 30, 2020 was $661.4 million. We had 120 days of inventory at the end of the September quarter, up 3 days from the prior quarter's level and primarily a result of our strong gross margin performance. Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter were at 30 days, which was flat to the prior quarter. We believe distribution inventory levels for Microchip are still low compared to the historical range we have experienced over the past 10 years, which is between 27 and 47 days.
 Our cash flow from operating activities was $455.8 million in the September quarter. As of September 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $370.3 million. We paid down $331.1 million of total debt in the September quarter. Over the last 9 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $2.95 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our cash, excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several quarters.
 In the September quarter, we also exchanged $796.1 million of our 2025 and 2027 convertible senior subordinated notes for cash and shares of common stock. While these transactions did not impact the overall level of debt on our balance sheet, we believe that these convertible exchanges will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing the share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time.
 Our adjusted EBITDA in the September quarter was $566.7 million, and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $2.181 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 4.04 at September 30, 2020, down from 4.24 at June 30, 2020. Our dividend payment in the September quarter was $95.3 million. Capital expenditures were $6.3 million in the September 2020 quarter. We expect about $35 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal '21 to be between $110 million and $120 million. Our capital expenditure forecast for fiscal '21 has increased as we prepare for growth in our business as well as actions we are taking to increase our internal capacity in the face of constraints our outsourcing partners are experiencing, which Ganesh will talk more about.
 We continue to add capital to maintain and operate our internal manufacturing operations, support the production capabilities of new products and technologies as well as to selectively bring in-house some of the wafer fabrication, assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our destiny during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $39 million.
 I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh? 
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. In a weaker-than-normal macro environment, our microcontroller revenue performed better than we expected. Our microcontroller revenue was sequentially down 1.8% as compared to the June quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our microcontroller revenue was up 0.8%. Microcontrollers overall represented 53.7% of our revenue in the September quarter.
 Now moving to analog. Our analog revenue was sequentially down 2.3% as compared to the June quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our analog revenue was down 8.2%. The weaker year-over-year performance of our analog revenue as compared to our microcontroller revenue was primarily due to our product lines which originated from Microsemi, which had higher exposure to Huawei, the communications end market in general, the commercial aviation market and the space market. Analog represented 27.6% of our revenue in the September quarter.
 Our FPGA revenue was up 24.8% sequentially as compared to the June quarter and achieved an all-time record even going back to the Microsemi history. On a year-over-year basis, our FPGA revenue was up 16.3%. I would like to caution investors that although the FPGA revenue trajectory is positive, the revenue does have some lumpiness associated with it because of the large exposure to the aerospace market. FPGA represented 8.3% of our revenue in the September quarter.
 Our licensing, memory and other business, which we refer to as LMO, was flat in revenue as compared to the June quarter. LMO represented 10.4% of our revenue in the September quarter.
 In October, we completed the acquisition of 2 small private companies. The first acquisition was New Zealand-based Tekron International, a global leader of timekeeping technologies and solutions for smart grid and other industrial applications. Timing is an operational necessity for real-time smart grid management and monitoring. Modernization, complexity and cybersecurity challenges within the power utilities are driving the need for more precise, secure and reliable time. Acquiring Tekron enables us to expand our offering for the expanding smart energy and industrial markets.
 The second acquisition was Toronto-based LegUp Computing, whose high-level synthesis tool expands our FPGA edge compute solution stack to make it easier for software engineers to harness the algorithm accelerating power of Microchip's PolarFire FPGA and PolarFire system-on-chip platforms. The LegUp acquisition also complements the VectorBlox acquisition we made a year ago, which added domain expertise in the areas of machine learning algorithms and vector processing for edge compute applications.
 Tekron and LegUp were very small tuck-in acquisitions, more akin to acquiring intellectual property along with domain experts to help us accelerate our business agenda in specific laser-focused areas. Both acquisitions were valued in the mid-single-digit millions of dollars and hence not material to the rate at which we're paying down our debt. The 2 acquisitions are expected to add less than $1 million of revenue in the December quarter.
 In mid-September, per the U.S. Department of Commerce regulation, we stopped all shipments to Huawei. Our Huawei-originated revenue represents about 1% to 2% of Microchip's overall revenue and was sequentially down from the June quarter to the September quarter. We are working with the Department of Commerce to apply for licenses for products and technologies that we believe have no impact to U.S. national security interest. We do not know if or when such licenses may be granted. Therefore, we have no Huawei revenue in our December quarter guidance that Steve will provide.
 During the September quarter, we began to experience rising constraints in our supply chain due to a number of industry-wide factors, among them, Huawei's push throughout the supply chain to complete manufacturing of all their products prior to the shipment ban; competition for market share by Huawei's competitors seeking to replace them, which further stressed the supply chain; and ongoing shift of semiconductor manufacturing out of China to avoid tariffs and trade sanctions, pressuring the capacity in other Asian countries where we manufacture through our partners; a very significant mobile phone refresh cycle, which competes for the same outsourced capacity we used; and last but not least, the rising demand from the automotive, industrial and consumer markets, which we saw.
 The confluence of these factors created supply chain constraints, which are continuing into the December quarter. At times like this, we are fortunate to have our internal factory capabilities, and we are making strategic capacity investments as we seek to better position our business for growth.
 Given the current market dynamics, we are providing some qualitative trend insights into our principal end markets for the September quarter. As expected, we saw the automotive, industrial and consumer home appliance markets start their recovery. Medical devices for elective procedures, like hearing aids, pacemakers, et cetera, which experienced a slowdown in the June quarter as individuals and hospitals delayed elective procedures, also started the recovery in the September quarter. As expected, we also saw the work-from-home-related markets of computing and data center as well as medical devices for hospitals revert to more normal demand patterns as the surge we saw in the June quarter dissipated. In general, enterprise demand remains weak as most businesses remain predominantly with work-from-home policies, thus deferring enterprise spending for the office environment.
 Finally, before I hand off to Steve, I would like to take the opportunity to express my deep gratitude to Steve and to the Microchip Board of Directors for the responsibility being entrusted in me when the baton gets handed next March. As we all know, Steve will be leaving big shoes to fill, with an impeccable 30-year history as CEO of Microchip. Yet the partnership we have forged over many years of working together, in addition to the support of our long-tenured executive team at Microchip, gives me confidence to lead the next phase of Microchip. I would especially like to thank Steve for being my mentor and my partner through the many years that we have engaged business challenges and opportunities together and for everything I've been privileged to learn from him. I am particularly glad and thankful that Microchip and I can count on his continued support and advice in his Executive Chair role. Thank you, once again, Steve.
 Let me now pass it to Steve for comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve? 
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2021. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2021.
 The September quarter continued to demonstrate what the best of Microchip culture and its people represent. Our global team of operations, business units, sales and marketing and support groups all came together in the middle of a global pandemic while working with a pay cut and delivered a superb quarter. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic challenges, we delivered net sales of $1.31 billion that was essentially flat sequentially and down only 2% from the year ago quarter. This is compared to our net sales guidance, which was to be down 4% sequentially at the midpoint as we capitalize on strong turns opportunities in September. We also delivered outstanding non-GAAP gross margin of 62.2%, which were near an all-time record level. We also achieved non-GAAP operating margin of 39.2%, above the high end of our guidance. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was $1.56, $0.15 above the midpoint of our guidance.
 Our bookings were very strong in the September quarter. We began the September quarter with a backlog position on July 1 to be down 8% from the backlog for June quarter on April 1. With strong bookings and strong turns still in the quarter, we ended the quarter at essentially flat compared to minus 4% at the midpoint of our guidance.
 Now I will discuss our guidance for the December quarter. Our bookings have remained strong in October. We are seeing a good recovery in the automotive, industrial, home appliance and medical devices for elective procedures markets. At the same time, work-from-home-related markets of computing and data centers as well as certain medical devices that surged with the pandemic revert to more normal demand. There is one other factor that we have to account for in our guidance for the December quarter, and that is the Huawei effect. Huawei was an over 1% customer in the September quarter, and it will be 0 in the December quarter.
 Taking all these factors into consideration, we expect our net sales for the December quarter to be between flat to up 5% sequentially. Considering that, seasonally, the December quarter is down by approximately 2% to 3% and counting the minus 1% Huawei effect, we believe that our guidance is well above seasonal and represents multiple industries recovering as well as Microchip continuing to gain market share in multiple end markets and product lines.
 Investors and analysts have asked us in the last few months about making a call about the bottom of this cycle. With tremendous uncertainty about the COVID-19 situation and the elections, we have not been willing to make the call. Today, we are making that call. We expect that June and September quarters were the bottom for this business cycle for Microchip. We are guiding to a much stronger-than-seasonal December quarter. And we expect significant growth in calendar year 2021.
 Based on the much better-than-expected financial results in the September quarter, we gave our employees half of their September quarter salary sacrifice back in the form of a bonus. We have also been gradually lowering the percentage of salary sacrifice. And just yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the entire company to revert back to full salary later this month. These salary changes are dialed into our guidance that we are providing today. We thank all of our employees worldwide that have traveled this journey of shared salary sacrifice with us in the past 3 quarters, enabling us to be prepared for multiple contingencies as COVID-19 uncertainties unfolded. This represents the best of Microchip culture and the commitment of our employees to ensure the long-term success of the company.
 For the December quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 62.4% and 62.8% of sales, which will be a new all-time record. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 23.1% and 23.7% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 38.7% and 39.7% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.51 per share to $1.63 per share. We also expect to pay down another approximately $300 million of our debt in the December quarter. We continue to believe in the strength and diversity of the businesses and end markets we are in to achieve long-term growth in excess of the average semiconductor market growth.
 I would like to advise investors and analysts about one other change. In the past, we have been providing a mid-quarter update often to coincide with our presentation at sell-side financial conferences. Our peers and competitors typically do not provide a mid-quarter update. Beginning this quarter, we will discontinue this practice and no longer plan to provide such updates. Given all of the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.
 With this, operator, will you please poll for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. 
Ambrish Srivastava: Steve, congratulations, and you'll be missed. And Ganesh, congratulations to you as well. I guess you'll have to take over Steve's role to keep us on our toes when we get on this call to ask a question. 
Ganesh Moorthy: It's a hard act to follow. 
Ambrish Srivastava: I know, big shoes to fill, but we would be expecting you to. 2 questions for me. One is on the constrained side. Could you just help us understand how has that translated into lead times? And then if you didn't have the constraints, how much of the business or what would the guidance have been? And then the second question is, maybe Eric can help us on this one, is on the capacity side. So a lot of moving parts there. So what was the -- what has been the outsourced versus in-source, both front end, back end? And then the capacity -- the CapEx increase, what should we be expecting both those 2 to be? And then how is that going to impact gross margin? 
Ganesh Moorthy: Do you want to take the lead times, Steve? 
Steve Sanghi: No. You go ahead. Take it. 
Ganesh Moorthy: So on lead times, the vast majority of our line items still have a 4- to 8-week type of lead times for standard products. There are specific package combinations that do have longer lead times. What is happening is, for the factors that I described, it is eating into multiple layers of the supply chain, so into the packaging and some of the subassembly involved in the packaging and into the testing infrastructure as many of these things come together at the same time. So we don't have huge issues with supply issues, but we have spot issues with specific package product combinations where they are. But by and large, for the vast majority of our products, we still have pretty good lead times. Go ahead, Eric. 
J. Bjornholt: Okay. The second piece of your question was there was -- it was kind of multifaceted there, but we've got some capacity questions. So we are making investments, as we walked through in our prepared remarks, in wafer fab, assembly and tests to increase our capacity. And if you look at last quarter, we did about 39% of our wafer fab in-house, 47% of our assembly and about 54% of our tests. These are relatively slow-moving metrics even with making investments. But over time, we absolutely would expect the assembly and test percentages to go up as we make these investments. But again, they're relatively slow-moving metrics.
 But the investments that we're making are all gross margin accretive. And you can see that our gross margin, we're guiding up in the current quarter, and we are expecting lower underutilization charges in the current quarter as we ramp our factories. And all these incremental adds to capacity that we're making, whether it's fab assembly or test, should all add to gross margin benefits for us down the road. 
Ambrish Srivastava: But unable to quantify at this point, Eric, as to how to think about the longer-term -- not the gross margin, what would the steady-state assembly and test would look like and front end would look like in-source versus outsourced? 
J. Bjornholt: So again, I don't expect the wafer fab to move significantly in terms of the percentage that we do in in-source versus outsourced. As the business grows, obviously, we're making investments. On the assembly and test side, we do expect those percentages to go up. Ganesh, do you want to give a comment on where you think they can go over time? 
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. They move a little bit more slowly over time, and we expect that they will probably be in the north of 60% longer-term for assembly probably north of 70% for test. And there's a lot of moving parts into going into that. But that's what we like to be at. It gives us some control. It gives us capacity when it's difficult to get outside, gives us some control on our costs as well. And it all pays for itself in short periods of time in the way we measure what we do or don't do. 
Steve Sanghi: With the Micrel, Microsemi and Atmel acquisitions, we were at about 70% assembly and 95% test. So as we bought these 2 large companies, Atmel and Microsemi, they were much more outsourced than we were and our percentages dropped quite dramatically. And we've been working our way up and ideally would like to get back to the higher than 60% assembly and probably higher than 80% test, but it's a painful and slow transition because there's just too many variants, too many packages, too many test programs to correlate and all that. So it's an ongoing effort that will go on for years, but there are really no quick movements. 
Operator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. 
Vivek Arya: And congratulations and best wishes to both Steve and Ganesh. Steve, my question is both near term and the growth you are expecting for next year. When I look at near term, in the September quarter, your microcontroller and analog sales were down a little bit. Year-on-year also, they are down a little bit. So I'm curious what is giving you the confidence to say we are at the bottom of the cycle when there is still some macro uncertainty because of elections and lockdowns. I'm just curious to hear those views.
 And then when you say significant growth for calendar '21, when I look at consensus growth numbers right now, they are for about, I think, 7% or so sales growth. What does significant mean? Does it mean 5%, 10%, 15%? What is significant in your book? 
Steve Sanghi: Well, what gives us the confidence is really we have worked through all the -- if you go back to February, March time frame, many of the estimates that the analysts and investors had were a very, very large drop because of COVID, of the type of 20%, 30%. Many people were modeling the business like the 2009 global financial crisis. Even some of our competitors were. We saw it clearly, and we were not modeling the business to be down that much. And we were right, our business was up in March. It was down only 1.3% sequentially in June. It is flat in September. And it's going up in December. So we kind of have been relatively more correct than anybody else.
 We are seeing substantial backlog building up. The backlog for the current quarter is significantly stronger than the backlog for the last quarter. And this is supposed to be a seasonally down quarter. Still, we think we're going to do pretty well. And then the bookings we're receiving, which are aging into the next quarter and the quarter after, are just very, very large. We're getting very, very strong bookings.
 Now some of that is concerns about the supply chain, a lot of constraints and all that, so people are giving orders earlier. Not that our backlog is much larger than before at a similar point in time, but that doesn't mean all that becomes growth because people give you orders earlier and then the crawl chart rolls off because you already got the bookings. But despite all that, we're expecting a much, much better March quarter and a significant growth after that. You asked what does significant mean, it means a lot more than 7% that you have a consensus. 
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse. 
John Pitzer: So I'll add my congratulations to both Steve and Ganesh. And Steve, I appreciate all the help over the years. I'm sure a lot of the analysts on the call feel the same way. I guess my first question is, Steve, you're calling sort of for the bottom of the cycle, June, September levels. I think what's very impressive is where your operating margins are despite the fact that we're at the bottom of the cycle.
 I'm just kind of curious, I know that expenses have been a little bit light this year because you guys have pulled back on things like variable comp. But given that you're not in the market of buying assets and you're really going to be just focusing on operational efficiencies, how should we think about incremental operating margins and kind of where operating margins can go from here? 
Steve Sanghi: So I think we have given a longer-term model, which is 63% gross margin, 22.5% operating expense and 40.5% operating margin. We're not quite there. We're getting close. The midpoint of our guidance is about 62.6% in gross margin this quarter, and I don't quite have the number on the top of my head on the operating margin. We got a little bit more to go before we really get to our numbers. And we will be analyzing going into the next fiscal year. We'll be looking at all that and at some point in time, coming back to The Street with a new longer-term target when we think that current targets have either been achieved or within a striking range. 
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then for my follow-up for Ganesh. Your commentary around FPGAs in your prepared comments, notwithstanding kind of your caution that's a lumpy business, I'm just kind of curious if you can talk a little bit about kind of your core advantage in that market. That's becoming sort of a rarer asset over time now with some of the M&A activity in the space. What kind of longer-term prospects do you see in the FPGA space for you? 
Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So in the FPGA market, we play specifically in the midrange of FPGAs, which is measured by how many logic elements there are in it. We don't go after the very high end. There are other players who are invested there. But in the midrange and lower end, we focus on applications that need low power. We have nonvolatile memory on these products that have security needs, that have robustness needs. And those take us into end markets that we really like. Those end markets are defense and aerospace. They're automotive, now with Microchip taking FPGA products into our historical strength, and industrial, once again, Microchip taking FPGA into our historical strength. So those are the end markets that we believe we're able to take, over the long term, the advantages of what we bring with our FPGA products in terms of low power, security, robustness and being able to position it into the markets where we have the strengths. 
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. 
Toshiya Hari: And congrats to both Steve and Ganesh. Steve, you talked about your December quarter guidance being roughly 5 percentage points above typical seasonality, maybe 6% when you take into consideration the Huawei dynamic. You also talked about end market strength and share gains contributing to that outperformance. What portion of that 5% to 6% outperformance relative to typical seasonality is share growth? And what percentage is end market strength? And you sort of alluded to this before, but are you concerned at all that customers are pulling in end demand and you see a correction in sometime in the first half of '21? 
Steve Sanghi: Well, first of all, it's impossible to break down the growth better than seasonality into the 2 components that you described, what portion of the growth is market share and what portion of the growth is really just better end market. That's really very, very difficult on a short-term basis. You could really do a longer-term comparison on a growth rate basis, looking at how everybody else grew. We have no idea how everybody else is going to do this quarter or next quarter or next year. So I don't really have a good answer to that question.
 But to your question about the correction next year because customers are pulling in, we don't really see customers pulling in demand, we see customers pulling in, placing their orders and then scheduling them into the next year -- next quarter and the quarter after. And this is something we asked for through our letter back in July. We asked the customers then that in addition to the near-term orders that you've been giving us, please give us a longer-term backlog, tell us your requirements in the time of building constraints so we can plan accordingly and put the capacity in place. And customers have responded very strongly.
 So we're getting very strong bookings. But the component of the bookings that's aging into the next quarter and even a quarter after is very, very good. We have a lot of backlog already for the June quarter. And we have very, very strong backlog for the March quarter. So they're not pulling in deliveries, they're pulling in, placing orders and scheduling the deliveries, so they're not left short in case there are constraints. 
Toshiya Hari: Got it. And then as a quick follow-up, Steve, obviously, you've had a very successful career over multiple decades. Anything you feel like you left on the table? I know you're not necessarily leaving the company, but anything on your to-do list that Ganesh and the team can potentially move forward with? 
Steve Sanghi: Well, I don't have any regrets in the timing of -- as I'm doing it, it's more -- much more age-related and a family situation and grandkids and all that. But I could really go back to the Microsemi acquisition, which we announced in 2018 and the goals we had set out in terms of earnings per share and overall accretion. And we were talking about achieving $8 by the end of the third year. Some of those got interrupted by 2 major industry events. One was the entire U.S.-China trade war that took some wind out of the sails and then the COVID-19. And due to those 2 events, our credit rating came under pressure. The leverage became much higher in an uncertain situation, which was comfortable in a growing business but not as comfortable in a situation when leverage is high and the business has a lot of uncertainty.
 Back in the March time frame, analysts and investors were asking me questions regarding what happens if your business goes down 35%. And I was telling them, our business is not going down 35%. And they were not believing it, like why not, what if it happens. So I would say that the last 2 years have been difficult. And if we were able to have a normal level of growth in the last 2 years and all the accretion that we have achieved on the top of that, we would be over $8 of earnings per share today and hopefully start with the near $200 rather than where it is today. And I leave that for Ganesh to put a 2 00 in front of it. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. 
Harlan Sur: And let me also offer my congratulations to Steve and Ganesh. I guess, first question, what was book-to-bill in the quarter? And then given the strong demand environment and constraints, now may not be the right time to be executing to this, but I believe that you guys still have a network of very small fabs in your manufacturing footprint. So if you can -- just maybe how much of this is yet to be consolidated? Can you just remind us how much more COGS savings are still to come as you consolidate these smaller fabs and over what period of time? 
Steve Sanghi: So we're not specifically providing a book-to-bill ratio for Q2. I think we had given the reason for that many times in the past. Our book-to-bill ratio was very good. And usually, we have seen investors and analysts essentially take the book-to-bill ratio and try to translate that into a growth number, which does not really work because I already said that a lot of the bookings, strong bookings that we are receiving, are actually aging into the March quarter and some even into the June quarter.
 So bookings -- the bookings we receive for aging over the next 12 months, and you divide that number by billings in 1 quarter, so it's a little bit apples and oranges. Bookings over the next 12 months, aging over the next 12 months, but billings shipped into the last quarter. The number was very good, but providing that numerically, that number, we have seen investors not interpret it correctly. What was the second part of your question? 
J. Bjornholt: It had to do with cost of sales, improvement and ongoing consolidation of factories and things like that. So I'll start, and then Steve or Ganesh can add on to that. So we announced last November some restructuring of our Colorado wafer fab, and we're making excellent progress on those fronts and have achieved a large amount of the cost savings that we outlined at that time. And you've seen our gross margins hold up extremely well. There's still work to be done. Our operations teams and both the front-end operations and the back-end operations are extremely busy. And we talked about our capital expansion plans and the improvement that we'll see in gross margin there. And obviously, the more product running through our own factories absorbs the large flywheel of activities that we have on the cost side.
 So we've got a lot of good things working on gross margin. We've guided at the midpoint this quarter to 62.6%, which isn't very far away from our 63% target. So we feel good about that. And -- but I don't think we're going to talk specifically about some of the specific actions that are being taken, but we're doing well on structuring the operations appropriately. Steve or Ganesh, anything to add to that? 
Steve Sanghi: Well, yes. What I will add is that if you look at our gross margin and operating margin performance in this down cycle, I mean, it's been exemplary. And compare it to any of the prior cycles, we did just extremely well. Our gross and operating margins did not go down by many hundreds of basis points. I think gross margin used to go down by 600-plus basis points. Now why is that? I think that's partially the result of diversifying the business, creating several end markets. The acquisitions we did really helped us build that, serving the entire solution of the customer with a total system solution. So the revenue didn't fall as much. The gross margin didn't fall as much. And the operating margin didn't fall as much. And we are sitting at near-record gross margin and just had shy of the record operating margin at the bottom of the cycle.
 And as we go from here, as the revenue increases and we are ramping all of our factories, as I spoke about, all our high-volume fabs and assembly and test are all on a rapid ramp to provide the growth that we see into next year. We have increased our capital expense budget. So as we achieve that ramp, the incremental cost of the next product we make is much lower than the cost of the product we're making today because you get better absorption and the incremental gross and operating margin, you understand that concept. So it's a very, very exciting time we're going into, where, at the bottom of the cycle, we are near a record. And then, from there, as the factories ramp and the underutilization first goes to 0 and then you go above that and incrementally start dropping gross and operating margin, that would be very, very good. And what we need to do is really put some numbers around it and at some point in time, talk to you regarding what does that mean in the long-term model that we're not prepared to do today. 
Harlan Sur: Got it. Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up on the product side. I thought that you guys actually introduced the RISC-V-based FPGA product, but I wanted to get your views on any initiatives that the team has in terms of RISC-V open architecture as an addition to your MCU product portfolio. 
Ganesh Moorthy: So we are part of the RISC-V foundation through the Microsemi acquisition. It had started before us. The first point of implementation is on the FPGA SoC product lines. And we did introduce that, as you noted. There are many possibilities with RISC-V, and they are being evaluated within Microchip, but there's really nothing to report at this point beyond what we have done on FPGA. 
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. 
Craig Hettenbach: Certainly, quite the journey, Steve, in the last few decades, to see that the company evolved just organically and through M&A. On the last point, including M&A, I think one of the things that's been focused now is with total system solutions. Maybe you can just give some context or update of kind of where you stand with that and some of the efforts you're driving through the sales force. 
Steve Sanghi: So I think when you look at an embedded control system, a microcontroller-based system, it has a large number of components around it. And over the years, the number of components have increased. Now even go back 10, 15, 20 years ago, it will usually have some sort of power management, A to D converters, reference devices, maybe some discrete devices, some study grams, some memory, flash memory, nonvolatile memory. It will have those kind of things.
 But over the years, the amount that goes around that microcontroller has increased substantially, and it increased substantially with connectivity. So today, you need a USB, Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, display driver, touch functionality, so just high-voltage sensors and others. So the number of components that go into an embedded control system have really multiplied in the last 20 years.
 And we began our journey of really selling things around the microcontroller beginning in about '99, 2000, and then we did a small analog acquisition of TelCom Semiconductor in 2001. And with those resources and adding to it, we started building our analog franchise. And then we didn't really start doing the drumroll of acquisitions until about 2010. But the results have been that we have added all those products now available from Microchip, you can buy them as a kit or you can buy them separately. But if you now look at a reference design for an application and almost find any embedded control application in home, in industry, in car and in any place, open an appliance and look at its printed circuit board, you can essentially have everything on that from Microchip today, a microcontroller, a memory, analog, converters, opt-ins, some sensors, power management, drivers, connectivity, Bluetooth, Ethernet, WiFi, 802.11, anything else.
 And so we feel that we have done all that, and now we have a powerful franchise to be able to sell that entire solution. And the challenge in the last couple of years has been now training the sales force to really be able to take that kind of message to the market, and they're doing very well at it. So at this point in time, we do not really feel a burning desire to have to do another acquisition. The valuations are sky-high, will never meet our taste. And number two, we still have high leverage and we're paying down debt. And we have clearly signaled to The Street that when our leverage goes down and then we're still producing a large amount of free cash flow, a more likely use of that free cash flow is the increasing dividend and stock buyback and all that and not the new set of acquisitions. So I think that's where we are because we feel we have completed the solution, we have an enormous scale and do not have the scale disadvantage anymore. And with that, we are going to grow the business organically. 
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from William Stein with Truist Securities. 
William Stein: And I'll add my congratulations on the transition. It's been quite a run. So congrats on that. I want to dig into the concept of book-to-bill and backlog that you've made very positive comments around, Steve. But maybe I can ask about it this way. It sounds like the book-to-bill was very strong. Backlog is up a lot, but it's coming more in the form of duration of backlog as opposed to what's deliverable in the near term. Is there any metric you can give us around that, around the duration or around maybe what portion of March do you think is now filled?
 And then the concurrent question with that is those behaviors from customers typically happen under 1 of 2 conditions, either the customers suddenly have a lot more confidence or optimism in their business and the other is when they think they're not going to be able to get supply. I wonder if you could comment as to which of those you think is driving the improved duration of the backlog. 
Steve Sanghi: So I think it's a combination of it. Obviously, having such a broad customer base of 125,000-plus customers, you often don't really know how the customer is thinking, so you get samples of it as you talk to the large customer and visit them. And we're really not even visiting them these days. The interaction is largely virtual. But I think it's a combination of customers reading about strengthening lead times in the industry, constraints they are hearing. And when they have an experience from not being able to acquire one component, let's say, from one of the other suppliers, the purchasing manager's action often is to really go ahead to secure and place the order on all the components, whether the lead times are going out at a particular supplier or not.
  And in our case, we specifically advised the customers back in March that we were getting largely short-term orders, and we need short-term orders to make the quarter. That's great. We thank them, but we also needed your longer-term orders so we can more efficiently build the parts and batch process it and place the orders on our suppliers ahead of time and so on and so forth. And what I would say is that the customers have responded extremely well. I mean our customers have always responded to our letters extremely well. And what you have seen is, a quarter later, exactly a quarter after we wrote that letter, and customers have placed a large amount of backlog that ages into the following quarter. 
J. Bjornholt: Maybe just want to clarify one thing Steve said there. He mentioned the letter to customers in March. It was actually in July. I know that's what he meant to said, but just for the record. 
Steve Sanghi: I meant -- yes, July 7 was the date I thought, somewhere early July. 
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Shawn Harrison with Loop Capital. 
Shawn Harrison: My best wishes. An easy question, hopefully, and then a question more on distribution. With the volatility in FPGA associated with the aerospace business, should we assume that you kind of see more of a normalization here in the December quarter? 
 And then second, Steve, how are the distributors reacting to the tightness in supply or the tightening of supply out there? I know you highlighted that channel inventory days are still low, but is there any pressure for them to add more Microchip stock? 
Steve Sanghi: So what was the -- I'll take the distribution. What was the first part of the question? 
J. Bjornholt: On the FPGA trends. Why don't I take that one, Steve. 
Steve Sanghi: Go ahead. 
J. Bjornholt: So as we have said many times, FPGA is a more lumpy business. Trajectory-wise, if you plot the last many quarters, you'll find that it is up and to the right. Quarter-to-quarter, there are going to be changes depending on which lumpy business is coming through or is delayed for whatever reason, and that's what you will continue to see. But if you look at it over 8, 9, 10 quarters, you'll see that it is up and to the right as an overall FPGA business for us. 
Steve Sanghi: Go ahead, Steve. So on the distribution front, we're getting huge orders from distribution just as well as we are getting it from direct customers. So our bookings were strong in both, in the distribution channel as well as in the direct channel. And the behavior is largely similar where we're getting bookings to make -- we got the bookings to make the September quarter, and we're getting good bookings to fill up the December quarter, but very large number of bookings are really actually aging into the March quarter and some even in the June quarter. So distributors also are layering in the backlog so that, if the lead times push out further, they're not impacted, and they're placing the backlog already going into the next quarter. 
 So when we wrote the letter, the letter was not only to our direct customers. It was also the same message to the distributors, and they have responded in kind. And just overall inventory has been low for quite some time. I think it hit 15-year low. And then from that, it has only come up a day or two. So in the coming year, as we are expecting significant growth, my sense is it's really up to distribution, but my sense is that the distributor will have to increase the inventory and can sit at a 15-year low. 
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James. 
Christopher Caso: Yes. And Steve and Ganesh, congratulations to you both. It's been a pleasure working with you both. The question is regarding seasonality. And you mentioned your view of normal December seasonality down 2% to 3% sequentially. I know in the past, since the Microsemi acquisition, you've hesitated to make a call on seasonality because there really hasn't been much of a normal environment since that acquisition closed. Given that you've offered that for December, do you have a view or an updated view on what you'd consider to be normal seasonality for the March, June and September quarters? 
Steve Sanghi: We really don't. I think we're going to have to run a whole year normal and kind of start to look at it. If you go back prior to the Microsemi acquisition, then March quarter will usually be up sequentially, I would say, a couple of percent, 2%, 2.5%. This year, March was up 1.3%, although it got impacted at the late part of March with the China not coming back from the COVID-19 crisis. Despite all that, I think we were up a couple of percent and could have been more. So I think the March seasonality is somewhere around 2%, 2.5%. But I think there are less data points on it with the acquisition than would be otherwise. If you take the Microsemi out, I feel comfortable with a couple of 2%, 2.5%. Add the Microsemi in, we don't have enough data points. 
Christopher Caso: Right. Okay. Understood. Just as a follow-up, with regard to the repayment of debt. Eric, this is for you. Just could you give us a sense of what your expectations will be over the next few quarters? Again, assuming that there is some degree of recovery, as you say, you should be generating more cash. And how does that affect the timing on getting to your net debt target, which I believe is 3? 
J. Bjornholt: Yes. I mean we've been generating a bunch of cash each quarter. We indicated that we expect about a $300 million debt paydown in the current quarter. There's some positives and negatives. Obviously, if revenue is growing, we're going to throw off more operating margin, and we are specifically trying to invest a bit more in capital as we talked about. So our CapEx was extremely low in both the June and September quarters, and it's going to be higher here in December and March so a bit of an offset. But I would expect $300 million-plus range. And as the business environment improves, that's only going to go up. So we're making really good progress on debt paydown and expect that to continue. And you mentioned the 3x or less, and that's what we're looking for, looking to be an investment-grade rated company. And over time, we will absolutely get there. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Janet Ramkissoon. 
Janet Ramkissoon: Congratulations, guys. Steve, thanks very much. It's been a real pleasure to be along your side for the last 30-some years since you became CEO. And again, congratulations to all. I had actually 2, really quick. Can you give a little color on what's going on in the auto business? Do you feel that we -- there is a secular change happening in demand for autos because of COVID and safety? And secondly, can you provide a little more color on Huawei? When did you apply for the license? And what is -- can you give us what your best-case scenario might be if you were to get the license? And when you get it, how fast can you ramp up? 
Steve Sanghi: Well, first of all, thank you, I think, you been with us for probably the entire 30 years or so or 27 years as a public company and prior to that even. Long association, so thank you. And I remember you came to visit our booth in Las Vegas at the CES conference earlier this year. 
 Regarding your specific question on Huawei and automotive, so the automotive business is -- saw the largest decline out of any end of market back in the June quarter because many, many factories is downright shutdown. And then in the September quarter, they started to bring the factories back up, and the business was up from June quarter to September quarter. But the September quarter factories were not full from the beginning. They were ramping during the quarter. So there is quite a substantial growth in the automotive segment, at least for us from September quarter to December quarter, as the factories continue to ramp. 
 So the automotive business now from this point on, kind of looks normal. Cars are selling. The inventory is low, so they're rebuilding their inventory. Lots and lots of automotive customers are making investments into electric vehicles, where we have significant content. And the content in electric vehicle is actually higher than the content in a regular vehicle. So automotive business should look good going forward from here. 
 The other part of your question is Huawei license, when did we apply? Let me hand it off to Ganesh to answer that question. 
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. So our application was within the last month. It is a very uncertain process of how it navigates through department of commerce and whoever else would have to weigh in on it. I think it's impossible to give you an estimate of what might happen and when and what would it mean. The business with Huawei has many products and is not just a single license. We would need multiple licenses, and each one has a separate application you'd have to go through. And we have a prioritized process that we're going through with it. Given the uncertainty of the process, we did not believe trying to count on any revenue made sense. And once we have line of sight to the license, we would still need to work with Huawei on what they would need, when we would be able to ship the product to be able to provide any kind of guidance on what does it mean to our business. 
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. 
Matthew Ramsay: Congrats to you both. Ganesh, I wanted to ask a question. I noticed some of the private company tuck-ins and some of the investments that you've been making over the last few quarters regarding the edge opportunities. Our team has done quite a lot of work on edge as an emerging market, both on edge clients and on sort of edge cloud. And I wonder if you might give a little context as to how big of an opportunity you guys might think about this being over the next 3 to 5 years for Microchip and if it's something that might evolve out of your FPGA franchise or out of your microcontroller franchise or if there's need for a bit heavier-handed compute that might be required as you guys approach some of these edge opportunities. 
Ganesh Moorthy: When we think of the edge, it all comes around the mega trend of artificial intelligence and machine learning that we have spoken about. And we think of that in 3 different buckets, so to speak. There's a part of it which is the best known for many people, which is what happens in the cloud. And that is the domain of many people who have very large and highly processor-intensive compute. We do play in the cloud, but our role in the cloud is predominantly around PCIe switches and a few other things that are associated with how CPUs, GPUs from other companies [ are taught ]. The edge is the second part, and edge is an exceptionally important part as you think of factory automation and the industrial IoT because at that edge compute for the factory is where much of that machine learning is going to be taking place and the application of artificial intelligence. 
 There, we have introduced using FPGA as one of the platforms, a number of solutions. Smart embedded vision is one piece of that, which can go into machine vision for factories, physical security, medical vision, depending on that end application. But surrounding these products are many of our standard products, too. It needs microcontrollers, analog, security, things that process. And then the third element of artificial intelligence machine learning we're looking at is all the way to the end where the sensing is taking place. And there again, we're looking at our standard microcontrollers and some of the other products as to how can they do, to a lesser extent, but what is exactly needed at the end nodes, the learning and the inferencing that is needed using standard microcontroller. 
 So it's a much bigger field than just the edge alone in terms of our interest. But certainly, FPGA at the edge is a key part of how we intend to prosecute that. 
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from David O'Connor with Exane BNP Paribas. 
David O'Connor: Great. Congratulations on the results. Maybe a question on my side, going back to the supply chain constraints, which exact category of products are impacted there? And Ganesh, in your prepared remarks, you talked about Huawei, you talked about the mobile phone refresh and some reshuffling of share as well in capacity maybe. It seems more short-term related. So the question is, do you think these constraints dissipate from the March quarter? Are they here to stay with us for some time? And I have a follow-up on the gross margin. 
Ganesh Moorthy: So the general comment would be that it affects the supply chain of people who are packaging product, their supply chain, which can be lead frames, it can be substrates, can be equipment that does bonding and various other things. And so it may not be things that we are directly involved in, but it consumes bandwidth and capacity of the supply chain, both directly what we deal with and then their supply chain as well. And so all of these compete in many cases for either the materials or the equipment capacity that is out there that we would otherwise be using. And then as we go to use them, we find that, in some cases, they're constrained. We've been able to manage through a lot of it. We do have second sources for some of these things, and we do have a lot of internal capability. And as Eric mentioned, we are accelerating, bringing more capacity internal for some of the package types. 
 So what normally happens in business is, when you have these constraints, the companies that are in the business of providing that capacity or that material, respond with what they can do to take advantage of that situation. And so there is a capacity response that they come with. Some of it also, it's possible that there could be a surge in demand that then begins to dissipate. We can't really predict where that is. But we think that they're all going to be constrained through the December quarter, and it's possible some of that will spill over into the March quarter as well. But I don't have any line of sight into exactly when all the constraints will dissipate. 
David O'Connor: That's very helpful. And maybe a quick follow on the gross margin for Eric. Eric, the -- you talked about the strength in the March quarter, and it seems from just the higher utilization, you could hit that 63% gross margin in the March quarter. My question is on the additional CapEx that you budgeted for calendar year '21. How much of a headwind is that as that capacity comes online? Does that come on slowly through '21? Or is that going to come initially and we have to factor that into -- as a gross margin headwind into '21? 
J. Bjornholt: So in terms of when the capacity comes online, it depends whether it's wafer fab, assembly or test. And so it just depends on what qualification we have to go through and the work that needs to be done in our factory. So it comes on gradually over time. I don't view it at all as any sort of headwind to gross margin. It's just a matter of can we get it installed and up and running and get product out the door. So I think gross margin is in good shape. I didn't make a specific comment on gross margin for the March quarter. So I want to make it clear, we were just speaking about the current quarter, but there are lots of things that we're doing in our business and not the least of which is if we get into a better revenue environment as we look forward into '21, that's going to do very good things for our gross margin, and we'll continue to evaluate the long-term model because we're getting close. 
Steve Sanghi: I'd like to clarify one thing. You said somehow the capacity or the CapEx adds a headwind to the gross margin. That's entirely opposite of what we will experience. I believe the comment of the CapEx providing headwind to the gross margin comes from when you build a large greenfield fab and you spend $1 billion, then the process has to be qualified and it slowly ramps, meanwhile, the factory is depreciating. That's the kind of headwind to the gross margin probably you're talking about. And we experienced that back in 2003 when we were bringing up our Fab 4 up in Gresham, Oregon. 
 The kind of capacity we're talking about is not that. It's made up of $300,000 to $1.5 million various pieces of equipment in assembly and test and fab and the diffusion tubes and others incremental capacity. And it becomes productive really the quarter after it is added, and it never has a headwind to the gross margin. It's always accretive to the gross margin because the product it produces, it produces, I think, incrementally lower cost than the average product without that. So there is no headwind to the gross margin. There's only attrition to the gross margin. 
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. 
Vijay Rakesh: I'll add my congratulations for Steve and Ganesh. Just I'll combine my 2 questions. I know looking at the back half here, you're seeing some strength in auto industrial and also a nice recovery in China. Just wondering what your revenue exposure was in that industrial auto and especially -- or into China? And lastly, I'm sure there's some COVID impact on the gross margin line even though margins are very impressive where they have rebounded. Just wondering what that -- if you have kind of sized that COVID impact and that should go away or resume into next year. 
Steve Sanghi: I don't know if I got all that. I think the first part was really asking the mix of industrial and automotive. Ganesh, I don't know if we have that the last quarter. We only provide it once a year. 
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. And it doesn't move dramatically quarter-to-quarter. What we have shown publicly measured at the end of March for the prior year was that industrial was 28% of our revenue. Automotive was 15% of our revenue. Obviously, in the June quarter, there was more headwinds in those 2 end markets, but I don't really have a number. And then those are all reversing as we went into the September quarter and into the December quarters itself. So those end market percentages for us usually don't change that dramatically over time. And then I'll pass it back on the other part of the question. 
Steve Sanghi: I didn't understand the gross margin question. Can you restate that? 
Vijay Rakesh: I was wondering, in terms of COVID on a logistics and operational basis, I would assume there's some impact. So I was just wondering what the COVID impact was to the gross margin, and I would assume that would reverse. It would be a tailwind next year. 
J. Bjornholt: It's very small. 
Steve Sanghi: The impact of COVID and gross margin was more like in the June quarter when, within our factory in Philippines at a much lower capacity because you couldn't get all the people in, and we had 150 people living in the facility and working and sleeping there at 30% of the factory's capacity. There was no COVID impact in September quarter. I mean minor providing meals and others to the people who are living there, but there was really no meaningful impact in September quarter, and there's no recovery of that next year because there's no impact now. 
J. Bjornholt: Right. The amount in the June quarter was $2.8 million, and you'll see that in our press release, but there was nothing that we broke out separately because it was immaterial to the September quarter results. 
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our last question from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. 
Mark Lipacis: Great. The last question on Steve's last call. That's quite an honor. Ganesh, congratulations. And Steve, thanks a lot for all the great insights that you saved. I will miss them. I just had a kind of a strategic question for Steve. You kind of described a scenario where the M&A slows down. You're under a deleveraging cycle and then a capital -- kind of a capital return cycle. What does that say -- what should investors take away what that means about the semiconductor industry? And does it necessarily mean that, ultimately, that there's a different set of requirements from Microchip to their customers? Does it mean that there has to be a regearing of Microchip or Microchip 3.0, if you will? How should -- what should investors take away from that? Or is Microchip 2.0 the perfect equation for what we expect to see next in semis and for Microchip specifically? 
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think if you look at a Microchip of 10 years ago, it was providing predominantly microcontroller, which was 80% plus of our business, and a small amount of business remaining was either some analog products or memory products, but they were largely we couldn't complete a customer solution. So when we called on a customer, we largely provided microcontroller, maybe a little bit of other stuff they won in. And the customer will surround our microcontroller with analog coming from Maxim, ADI, TI, Intersil or others would buy WiFi connectivity from people who made maybe USB from Cypress, maybe Ethernet from some Ethernet company and so on and so forth. And we, many times -- there's an old story. I think if you have a couple of minutes, I'll tell you. 
 Back in 1993 time frame when we went public, we used to have a partnership with the Maxim where we will get hotel rooms where we will invite the customers and give seminars jointly. And we will take the front half of the room, and Maxim will take the back -- front half of the day and Maxim will take the back half of the day. We'll tell them how to design our microcontroller, and Maxim will teach them how to add analog around their microcontrollers. And it was a great partnership. It lasted for about 5 years. We both benefited, shared the expenses, and we didn't have analog products at that time. And the story's 20 years old. It was with Jack Gifford of Maxim who died many years ago. So many people wouldn't know it. 
 And then Maxim, Jack Gifford wanted Microchip to pay him something because he said we're bringing all the customers and you're benefiting from selling them microcontrollers, and I said this has been a great partnership for 5 years. We sold microcontrollers. You sold analog. Why are you disturbing this partnership? But he got greedy, and that broke the partnership. So we decided to go into the analog business. And fast-forward 20 years, we're doing $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion in analog now, attaching our own analog around microcontrollers. And in the process, we have acquired or built USB, WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, flash memory, Studygram, and all the others. 
 So when you look at it from a customer's perspective, a customer is getting a complete solution available from us today. And future M&A is not really required from a customer's perspective because we can complete the solution now. Now you can always have an acquisition at further depth in any area, acquire more analog, acquire more WiFi or acquire more something, but we also have a large number of design teams that are building and completing those solutions. So what we really said is that at the late stage of industry consolidation, the valuation have run sky high. We bought Microsemi at 5x sales. And we just paid 10x sales for Xilinx. So we believe the valuations are way too high. We're not going to pay that. We don't need other acquisitions. And our customers are going to be very, very well served by our complete solutions already. Does that make sense? 
Mark Lipacis: That's very helpful, Steve. Really appreciate it. 
Steve Sanghi: Thank you. 
Operator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sanghi for any additional and closing remarks. 
Steve Sanghi: I think when I thank our investors who have been with us for long, and I certainly have great relationship and a long career with all of you. I'll still be here. I'm not going away. We still have a conference coming up, a Credit Suisse conference in early December, then the next earnings call in February. And then on March 1, I become Executive Chair, but you will still see me at the investor circuit and conference calls and investor conferences and others. So I'll still continue to be involved with Microchip and not going away. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Once again, that does conclude today's conference. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect your phone lines.

===== 2021 Q1  (2020-08-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Microchip’s First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip’s Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Thanks, Brandon, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip’s Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip’s President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses, prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. Net sales in the June quarter were $1.31 billion, which was down 1.3% sequentially and above the midpoint of our upwardly revised guidance from June 2, 2020, when net sales were expected to be flat to down 6% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales as well as end market demand by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were strong at 61.7%, operating expenses were at 23.1% and operating income was an outstanding 38.6%, all better than the high end of our upperly revised guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $401.9 million, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.56 and $0.03 above the high-end of our upperly revised guidance from June 2nd. On a GAAP basis in the June quarter, gross margins were 61% and include the impact of $6.4 million of share-based compensation and $2.8 million of COVID-19 shelter-in-place restrictions on manufacturing activities. Total operating expenses were $580 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $235.4 million, special charges of $0.3 million, $6 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and share based compensation of $36 million. The GAAP net income was $123.6 million, or $0.48 per diluted share. Our June quarter GAAP tax benefit was impacted by a variety of factors, including tax reserve releases associated with the statute of limitation expiring, deferred tax adjustments related to intercompany movements of intellectual property rights, offset by tax reserve accruals associated with the outcome of the Altera case during the period and other matters. The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6% in the June quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal 2021 to be about 6%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as U.S. tax interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The cash tax payments beyond the June 2020 quarter associated with the transition tax are expected to be about $245 million and will be paid out over the next six years, including a payment that we made in July 2020 of $23.2 million. We have posted a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2020 was $657.2 million. We had 117 days of inventory at the end of the June quarter, which was down five days from the prior quarter’s level and right in the middle of our publicly stated inventory target of 115 to 120 days. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter were 30 days compared to 29 days at the end of March. We believe distribution inventory levels for Microchip are still low compared to the historical range we have experienced over the past 10 years, which is between 27 and 47 days. The cash flow from operating activities was $501.8 million in the June quarter. As of June 30th, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $380.2 million. We paid down $394 million of total debt in the June quarter and over the last eight full quarters, since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion of debt to do so. We have paid down $2.62 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business, as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was $562.2 million and our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA was $2.154 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity life in nature was 4.24 at the end of June 2020 down from 4.46 at the end of March 2020. Our dividend payment in the June quarter was $90.4 million. Capital expenditures were $9.5 million in the June 2020 quarter. We expect about $15 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 to be between $50 million and $70 million. We continue to add capital to maintain and operate our internal manufacturing operations, support the production capabilities for new products and technologies as well as to selectively bring in-house some of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect these capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the outsourced Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $41.1 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Great. Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let’s start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. In a weak macro environment, our microcontroller business performed better than we expected. On a GAAP basis, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially down 1.3% as compared to the March quarter, while from an end market demand standpoint, our microcontroller business was sequentially down 2.8%. On a GAAP year-over-year basis, our microcontroller business was up 1.2%. We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontroller solutions, including the industry’s smallest automotive grade maXTouch controller family, the first functional safety ready, AVR microcontroller family with a peripheral touch controller, the Switchtec advanced fabric generation – Generation 4 PCIe switch family, which enables complex fabric topologies with greater scalability, lower latency and higher performance and traditional PCIe switches. And last but not least, the Adaptec SmartRAID 3100E RAID, which stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disk adapters designed to provide reliable hardware RAID protection for customer data in cost sensitive end applications that require no power and high performance. Microcontrollers overall represented 54.9% of our end market demand in the June quarter. Now moving to analog. On a GAAP basis, our analog revenue was sequentially up 0.7% as compared to the March quarter. While from an end market standpoint, our analog business is sequentially down 0.7%. In both scenarios, our analog business performed better than we expected in the midst of a weak macro environment. On a GAAP year-over-year basis, our analog business was down 4.2%. During the quarter, we continue to announce and introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products, including an expanded portfolio of over 25 transient voltage suppressor vertical rays, and a 32 channel high-voltage analog multiplexion, further enabling miniaturization of medical ultrasound applications. Analog represented 28.1% of our end-market demand in the June quarter. Our FPGA revenue, on a GAAP basis, was down 10.3% sequentially as compared to the March quarter. From an end-market demand standpoint, our FPGA business was sequentially down 6.5%. Our FPGA business in the June quarter had one significant aerospace customer who were shut down hard due to COVID-19 restrictions for pretty much the entire quarter, resulting in lower-than-expected results. Despite this customer being unlikely to resume production in the September quarter, we are expecting the FPGA business to sequentially grow meaningfully in the September quarter. On a GAAP year-over-year basis, our FPGA business was down 4.6%. During the quarter, we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative FPGA products, including the vector blocks accelerator software development kit, which enables developers to take advantage of Microchip’s all fire FPGAs to easily create low-power neuro network applications. FPGA represented 6.7% of our end-market demand in the June quarter. Our licensing, memory and other product line, which we refer to as LMO, was flat as compared to the March quarter from an end-market demand standpoint. During the quarter, we introduced a new Phase Noise Analyzer, designed for engineers and scientists who rely on precise and accurate measurements of frequency signals generated for 5G networks, data centers, commercial and military aircraft systems, space vehicle, communication satellite and metrology applications. LMO represented 10.4% of our end-market demand in the June quarter. An update regarding coronavirus and its impact on our operations. Most of our nonfactory employee base continues to work from home. Our global teams have been highly engaged, collaborative and productive under the circumstances, resulting in strong customer engagement for new designs and effectiveness in our new product development programs. We would like to thank our teams worldwide for adapting as needed to changing conditions while continuing to deliver results. Our manufacturing operations, especially those in the Philippines and our outsourced partners in Malaysia, worked through various constraints throughout the June quarter and delivered increased output as reflected in our better-than-expected results. By the end of the June quarter, we had dug out of most of the delinquencies in our shipments that accumulated in April and May when unpredictable constraints from government mandates were in effect. Our customers and our supply chain partners also endure some constraints of their factories and logistics, primarily during the month of April and May. As we progress through May and June, we experienced many short lead time orders from customers, some of which we could not support in the quarter, primarily due to three factors: First, customers whose business has strengthened due to COVID-19 conditions like from work-from-home initiatives and medical devices; second, the partial recovery in May and June of some customers’ business, which experienced a sharp decline in the March-April time frame automotive being the biggest example of that in some industrials; and third, an unrealistic expectations from some customers that orders placed with short lead time can be supported by the slack in the supply chain. We are working with our customers to improve the visibility of their backlog so that we may serve them better. Given the current market dynamics, we are providing some qualitative insights into our principal end markets. Now before we provide commentary for the June quarter, we would first like to share with you our best estimate for our fiscal year 2020 revenue by end market, with over 120,000 customers served by Microchip and given the complexity of our customer base, it is laborious to collect this data, and we only do so every few years. We remind you that this data is only estimated, and it is not something we can track with high accuracy. Based on our analysis done in the June quarter for the fiscal year 2020 revenue, industrial remained our largest end market of 28% of revenue. Computing and data center was next at 18% of revenue, followed by automotive, 15% of revenue. Communications at 14% of revenue, consumer at 13%; and finally aerospace and defense at 12% of revenue. With that backdrop to provide context, here are some end-market trend insights for the June quarter that we’d like to share with you. Data center and computing continued to show strength from the shift to work-from-home requirements. However, we anticipate that these segments may revert to more normal demand patterns in the coming months as the search requirements start to dissipate. Automotive car sales and production in China recovered nicely to grow, sequentially, and year-over-year, benefiting our China automotive business. Our automotive business everywhere else had a very poor quarter as April and May were adversely impacted by widespread automotive factory shutdowns. We began to see recovery in June and believe that the worst for automotive is behind us. Medical devices necessary to treat COVID patients, like ventilators, respirators, oxygen monitors, portable ultrasound machines. They were all strong, in addition to a host of other hospital equipment needed for increased patient loans. Medical devices for elective procedures such as hearing aids, pacemakers, defibrillators, some of the large ultrasound MRI machines, those experienced a slowdown as individuals and hospitals delayed elective procedures. Even within the broad-based industrial and consumer markets, which were generally weak, we did see pockets of strength related to COVID-19. In consumer, the strengths that are related to gaming, home improvement and hobbyist projects for people shelter at home. In industrial, the strengths were related to UV disinfection system, air filtration systems, infrared temperature scanners and a generally increasing trend towards touch rate controls. Let me now pass it to Steve for comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2021, I will then provide guidance for then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2021. The June quarter demonstrated what the best of Microchip culture and its people represent our global team of operations, business units, sales and marketing and support groups all came together in the middle of a global pandemic, while working with a take cut and delivered a superb quarter. I’m proud of how rapidly the Microchip team adapted to the new constraints we faced so that our employees would be safe, our customers could be well served and our supply chain partners engaged to help ensure mutual success despite the challenges we faced. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic challenges, we delivered net sales of $1.31 billion that was down only 1.3%, sequentially and down only 1% from the year ago quarter. Our original net sales guidance was to be down 6%, sequentially, at the midpoint. In early June, we revised it to be down 3%, sequentially, at the midpoint, and we ended at down only 1.3%, sequentially. These are exceptional results against the backdrop of simultaneous supply and demand dislocations. We also delivered outstanding non-GAAP gross margin of 61.7%, 90 basis points above the midpoint of our original guidance from May 7, 2020 and non-GAAP operating margin of 38.6%, 260 basis points above the midpoint of our original guidance. And we did all this while reducing our days of inventory from 122 days to 117 days. I am particularly proud of producing 38.6% operating margin at near the bottom of the business cycle amidst a global pandemic. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was $1.56, $0.21 above the midpoint of our original guidance and $0.12 above the midpoint of our revised guidance. On a non-GAAP basis, this was also our 119th consecutive profitable quarter. In the June quarter, we paid down $394 million of our debt. Our total debt payment since the end of June 2018 has been about $2.62 billion bringing our net leverage ratio down to 4.24. The pace of debt payments has been strong, despite the weak and uncertain business conditions, underlying the strong – underlining the strong cash generation characteristics of our business as well as our active efforts to continue to squeeze working capital efficiencies. Now I will discuss our guidance for the September quarter after a strong March and April, our bookings were soft in May and June. But the bookings we received in May and June had a much higher mix of near-term requirements as the customers and distributors did not have the visibility to place longer-term orders. While the near-term aged to bookings filled up the June quarter, it left the September quarter backlog on July 1, 2020, to be down 8% compared to the backlog for June quarter on April 1, 2020. We also left a large amount of backlog unsupported out of the June quarter because those requirements came inside of our lead time and we were not able to ship them according to customer request aids. This all prompted us to write a letter to our customers and distributors, first informing them of the business environment and our cycle time to build their products. Then we ask them to place at least 12 weeks of backlog for their requirements. We also informed our customers and distributors that if they ask for expediting of an order, we would need to charge an expedite service fee given the disruptive nature of such orders. Through the letter, we are just trying to encourage customers to give us more visibility so that we can better meet their requirements. The expedite charges have never been material in terms of our overall revenue. With another month under our belt now since the letter, we have seen some of the customers and distributors respond the rate of bookings has increased. Our backlog for the September quarter is still well below the backlog for June quarter at the same point in time, but we believe that the stronger bookings now compared to weak bookings of May and June will continue to improve the September quarter backlog compared to June quarter. From an end-market standpoint, as you heard during Ganesh’s remarks, we have several cross currents, contributing strengths and weaknesses at the same time. The common denominator among them is whether COVID-19 was a tailwind or a headwind during the quarter for a given end market. The diversity of our end-market exposure, which we consider to be a strength, gives us the ability to capitalize on whatever strength there are during challenging market conditions. Taking all these factors into consideration, we expect our net sales the September quarter to be between flat to down 8% sequentially. A relatively broad guidance range is to help account for the lack of visibility and uncertainty associated with the evolving COVID-19 situation. Based on the much better-than-expected financial results in the June quarter, we gave our employees half of their June quarter salary sacrifice back in the form of a bonus. However, we have maintaining the salary cuts in the September quarter due to continued uncertainty. Our inventory at 117 days is now right in the middle of our 115 to 120 days target. Hence, we are also adjusting the factory schedules and removing the rotating time off. For September quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61.2% and 62.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between then 23.2% and 24.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 37% and 39% of sales. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.30 per share to $1.52 per share. We also expect to pay down another approximately $300 million of our debt in the September quarter. We believe that despite the near term pandemic-driven challenges, we are confident in the strength and diversity of the businesses and end markets we are in to achieve long-term growth in excess of the average semiconductor market growth. Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis except for net sales, which will be on GAAP basis. We believe that GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I think you mentioned bookings somewhat improved in July. Historically, what do August and September bookings do? And what are your assumptions in giving guidance for this quarter? Are you assuming that the bookings trend kind of stays where it is? Does it get better? Does it get worse? I’m just trying to frame the guidance versus some historical trends and what your assumptions are for what the environment does in the remaining months of the quarter?
Steve Sanghi: So Vivek, first thing I would say is that you should not really be looking at any past trends, because this is just not a normal environment. Our bookings and backlogs and expedites and customer requests are really all driven by end market by end market, what the effect of COVID-19 is and what the visibility of the customers and distributors are. So really just absolutely – bookings in a quarter would be stronger if you go into it with a weaker backlog and the bookings often will be – in turns would be lower if you have a strong backlog that all depends on lead time and visibility. So we went into the start of this quarter with basically – dramatically decreased visibility by our distributors and customers. Therefore, we started the quarter with a very, very weak backlog. If you recall, the June quarter, we started the June quarter on April 1 with a very strong backlog. From – coming from March and the turn of China from the new Chinese New Year and all that. And then the bookings during the June quarter actually declined through May and June, which was a reverse of what happens in a normal year because June is a very strong quarter and bookings accelerate from April to May to June, it was totally different this time. So again, in July, August and September, July bookings were up significantly from the June run rate. June was very low and August is just starting. But looking at just a couple of days of bookings, for August, they’re also pretty good and even higher than the July average. So our expectation is that August and September bookings would be strong. And near term turns still from those bookings will be significant, which will make up for how the quarter looks against the same point in time versus June. It will improve, and that’s really what is included in our guidance.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer: Hi, Steve. Thanks for let me ask the question. You said in your prepared comments that backlog heading into September is down about 8% from the comparable time period heading into the June quarter. But if I go back 90 days ago, you didn’t believe that backlog and at least your initial guidance for June took a fairly significant haircut to kind of the backlog and bookings. I’m just kind of curious, can you help us understand relative to the normal backlog coverage you have to your guide, how does sort of the September guidance look today?
Steve Sanghi: So same thing, John. I think, in this pandemic-driven environment, throw all the old graphs away because you will reach a wrong conclusion. If you recall, on April 1, our backlog was quite strong. And the guidance we gave – I think our backlog, Eric, was it up 9%, do I recall it correctly?
Eric Bjornholt: I’d have to go back in a second. I mean, our book-to-bill was like 1.17% in the March quarter. And so we entered with very strong backlog, and then we saw weak bookings and…
Steve Sanghi: So we had a very strong backlog. And we gave guidance, original guidance, which was actually to be down from 2% to 10% or 2% to 12%. So we basically said that the backlog will deteriorate from being up near 9% to down 6%. This is a reverse quarter where the backlog started lower, and it started 8% lower than April 1 and the midpoint of our guidance is really down – is down 4%. So this time, we’re improving. We are expecting the backlog to improve in comparison to the last quarter. Why? Because last quarter bookings declined during the quarter, this quarter bookings are increasing during the quarter. And it’s all visibility, pandemic, end-market driven, what’s happening in automotive, what’s happening in data center, what’s happening in others. And there is really no correlation to what happened in the last five years. So throw all seasonality of the past away.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful. But Steve, if I could just add on there. We’ve all struggled, and I think you guys have internally with all the acquisitions, defining what’s normal seasonal. Any update on what you can give us on or what you think a normal seasonal September quarter would look like sequentially?
Steve Sanghi: Well, first, the environment has to become normal, and we haven’t seen normal in the last couple of years with all the U.S.-China trade sanctions and then the tariffs and now global pandemic. So once we have to have a stable environment for a year or so to figure out what the new seasonality would be with our acquisitions. Right now, it would be anybody’s guess. And whatever the seasonality would be in future right now throw that aware.
John Pitzer: Thanks, guys.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.
Ambrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you, Steve. I’m going to ask for a clarification as well. I just want to make sure I understand your comments correctly. So as the last quarter progressed based on what – how you explained it, it sounds like bookings deteriorated because you had a lot of short lead time orders that were not met. And now heading into the September quarter; is it fair to assume then that those quarters are now – those quarters are scrub? But then how to I reconcile with the fact that you still had delinquencies that you could not meet. Should they be coming up in this quarter? I’m just a little bit confused on trying to reconcile all your comments on the short lead time orders and the booking trends. That made sense that as the quarter progressed, bookings deteriorated, but then what about the shorter lead time orders that you could not meet in the last quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Well, let me see if I can clear some of the confusion. So we started the June quarter with a fairly strong backlog, I recall up 9% or so, and Eric correct that. And then we got reasonable bookings in April. So April was a good month. So we’re still looking good. But bookings slowed down significantly in May and then dramatically so in June. So June was even lower than May, and the bookings were so low that if our orders from those bookings were normally aged in terms of near-term and outer-term, the quarter would have been very low. But the percentage of bookings that aged into the quarter were quite high. And even though we were not able to meet some of the bookings, some of those orders because of short lead time, we still beat the quarter. From an original guidance of minus 6% at the midpoint, we came in at minus 1.3%, which means we did meet a lot of the orders, but we still left a large amount of delinquent. And whatever was delinquent last quarter will get shipped this quarter. But since the bookings were so near-term, we started the quarter still very much on the whole, down 8% from last quarter. And now the bookings are strengthening, bookings have largely – the slope of the bookings have been higher, day after day bookings are increasing all through July. And therefore, the backlog versus the same point in time has improved somewhat, but there is a lot more to go. And we think at the rate the bookings are now and continuing to increase the shipments will improve from the minus 8% at the start of the quarter to minus 4% at the midpoint that we’re guiding to. Does that make sense now?
Ambrish Srivastava: It does, Steve. And if I just could ask one more clarification. Does that mean then that the visibility as you stand today is better than what it was at the same point in the prior quarter?
Steve Sanghi: I don’t think visibility is any better. I think visibility is very low. That’s why it’s improved from May and June, but it isn’t improved from March and April. I think March and April were very strong bookings. People had – China had just come back from Chinese New Year, and everybody was expecting a quick end to the pandemic, so there were a lot of bookings, people do want to get quite short. And the pandemic has went longer and longer and longer. And now there is no end in sight, nobody knows what’s happening. In many states, it’s reemerging. Some countries are still going higher every week. So now the customers and distributors are not giving long-term orders. It’s slightly better than it was in May and June. As I described, the bookings are higher, and we believe it may continue to improve in August and September.
Ambrish Srivastava: Okay, that is helpful. Thanks for your patients and good luck and stay safe.
Eric Bjornholt: And I’m just going to add on to what Steve said there, just to confirm that the 9% that he is quoting in terms of our opening backlog entering the June quarter, that is the accurate number for comparison purposes compared to the minus 8% or down 8% heading into the September quarter.
Steve Sanghi: So that’s a good comparison where June quarter started up 9%, and September quarter is starting down 8%.
Ambrish Srivastava: Got it. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: And the June quarter deteriorated – I’m sorry, improved from minus 9% to minus 1.3%. And we believe that this quarter will also improve from – this quarter will go the other way, it will go from minus 8% to minus 4% that we’re guiding to.
Eric Bjornholt: Right. Just to clarify that statement. We entered the June quarter with backlog being up 9%, and it deteriorated to the point where we finished the quarter at down 1.3%.
Steve Sanghi: Correct.
Ambrish Srivastava: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Craig Hettenbach: Yes, thank you. Steve, just a question, just from a geographic perspective, the initial growth was driven by China, and as you mentioned, coming back from China New Year. Do you think some of the China strength is sustainable? And then also, how are you feeling about other geographies like Europe and North America?
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh, do you want to take that?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. So China was certainly stronger last quarter than we expected. But China doesn’t live in isolation. China is affected by how other parts of the world do. And so as we go into the September quarter, it is still doing well, but we anticipate that weakness in Europe, weakness in Americas would have some impact on China and that’s all baked into the guidance that we have built.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Harsh Kumar: Hey, Steve. So I’m going to ask about what everybody else is talking about. So it sounds like there’s good demand, but sound like towards the end of last quarter, you saw short-term demand, but now you’re seeing the customer pivot completely and they are starting to place orders. So my question to you, as you guys talked, you guys do a great job. You’ve got lots of customers. You do a good job keeping up with them. What do you think is making the customer flip in this manner?
Steve Sanghi: I think it’s all COVID-19. Customers are not sure. There is a resurgence of COVID in certain countries and certain states in the United States, customers and distributors have low backlog from their end customers and our direct customers are not really sure what the run rate would be. So we’re getting frequent orders for short-term delivery that they have the demand today, and they need to build a product to deliver to their customer, but they do not know whether that is sustainable in September, in October, in November. So we’re getting – we’re not getting as many longer-term orders to fill the pipeline. But we’re getting enough orders to have the strong billings as we go. As we saw last quarter, there was enough strength in the short-term orders that the billings were good and we ended fairly good. And for all, we know that could happen this quarter, but we can’t say with certainty today with our backlog being low compared to same point last quarter. We could get enough chance to fill the quarter, but there is lack of visibility. Therefore, we can’t guide with that certainty.
Harsh Kumar: Fair enough, Steve and from my follow-up, your revenues are down quite a bit, based on your guidance, but your margin is pretty steady, pretty stable sequentially. Just curious if you have any thoughts on that?
Steve Sanghi: Well, so you should look at the results and look at it a little bit year-over-year. So when you look at year-over-year, we’ll be kind of much more than the pack overall in the semiconductors and actually, year-over-year guidance for September is better than really most of our microcontroller and analog competitors. So, everybody’s seasonality is different. Our automotive business is only about, Ganesh, is it 12 now?
Ganesh Moorthy: It’s probably 13%, 14% after the last quarter.
Steve Sanghi: Yes. So, our automotive business is about 13%, 14% of our business and some of our competitors, it’s 40%, 45%. So, they took a much larger hit when the automotive went down. Automotive was down 40% or so in the industry last quarter. And so they are seeing a much larger recovery, our business – we’re seeing a similar recovery, but being only 13%, 14% of our business, this impact will be lower.
Harsh Kumar: Fair enough. Thanks, Steve.
Steve Sanghi: So, we did better last quarter. This quarter, we’re doing worse sequentially, but if you look at year-over-year, our results are better than all of our larger competitors, TI assays and others. And as far as the question on the margin is concerned, I mean margin, there have been a lot of moving parts, internalization, more advanced stuff is technologies, some restructuring of our factories we have talked about before. So, lots of things we have brought to bear, which has been a tailwind on the margins, and this is really the best gross margin and operating margin performance of any cycle at microchip, because driven by all these self-help kind of things we have done. And when this business recovers and goes back to new record on the top line, I think you will see record growth in operating margins.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Shawn Harrison with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Shawn Harrison: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick clarification and then a follow-up. What was the underutilization in the charge this quarter, Eric?
Eric Bjornholt: The underutilization was about $13.9 million. That’s right in line with what it was and the March quarter. So flat-flat canceling.
Shawn Harrison: Steve, to kind of beat the dead horse on the demand environment. but are there end markets where you’re seeing sharper contractions in demand. We know automotive production will be up sharply in the September quarter. but where are you seeing maybe, a contraction or more volatility and kind of the bookings rate, if you could give an end market perspective, that would be helpful.
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh? I’ll give it to Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. So in my prepared remarks, I gave you some flavor of by different end markets what are we seeing in the June quarter? And I think as time goes on, some of these are going to start reverting to normal, which we think for example, data center, and work-from-home related items. You don’t need to continue to be at a high level. Once you’ve gotten past the first several months of buying what you need. And then those that were below in the initial phases like automotive and industrial should be the ones that begin to recover. We’ve already seen the automotive parts put a bottom in the June quarter and we’re expecting September to be good and we’re expecting December to be good and likewise, in some of the other segments. So, medical was another example, where some parts of medical did really well, because of COVID-related items. Other parts, the elective parts got pushed out, because people are not willing to go out of their homes. I would go set up consults for what was elective. elective will come back, you can’t push it out forever. And so that’ll be, in general, I think the places that will recur as time goes on, will be the ones that have more strength, and some of the things that are stronger could revert back to normal in the coming months.
Shawn Harrison: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo securities. Please go ahead.
Gary Mobley: Hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start with some questions for Eric. I wanted to ask about OpEx, it looks like for your guidance and what you delivered for the first quarter, you’re somewhere just south of $300 billion per quarter, that’s down, I believe more than 10% from last year. How much of that is the salary cuts in various other OpEx decreases like lower travel and just trying to get a sense of what oral might look like for you guys on the opex side, once things begin to turn out?
Eric Bjornholt: So, the salary cuts when at the levels we implemented, we quantified those last quarter of being about a $21 million per quarter run rate, that’s pulled out. And Steven talked about us giving some of that back to employees this last quarter is, because the results were really quite good. Things like travel, I mean, we haven’t quantified them, but they are pretty significant. And what I would say with that is I think some of that is probably more permanent than temporary. I think as we’ve adjusted from working from home throughout the organization in the different functions, people will become very effective in doing that. And I think overall travel, although it will come back to a higher level, some of that is going to be permanent savings. So, I think we’re managing the operating expenses very tightly in the environment that we’re in. and the employees are doing a good job of managing that for the environment. but overall, we’ve taken out a lot of costs, but as the business improves, some of those costs in terms of the salary cuts and some of the bonuses returning to a higher level, those absolutely will come back to the P&L and we’ll manage that appropriately, given where top-line growth is.
Gary Mobley: Okay. the follow-up, I wanted to ask about the debt structure, you guys refinanced and extended the maturity of a pretty hefty amount of your debt, it looks like as a result, your debt interest expense, the new norm might be substantially lower. Can you speak to what the new norm may look like for net interest expense and as well, given the low interest rate environment that we’re in, what the additional opportunities might be to draw down your cost of capital?
Eric Bjornholt: Sure. So, we were active in the debt capital markets and in the quarter, we issued $2.2 billion of senior secured notes and paid off a bridge loan, paid off some of our converts and then used the remaining funds to pay off amounts under a line of credit. The guidance that you’ll see, in our guidance table on the press release for other expense, which is most of that is interest expense is about $78 million on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, and that’s a pretty good run rate since all these debt transactions had occurred last quarter and are factored into that guidance. And obviously, we’re using a significant amount of the cash that we’re generating to pay down debt, everything early, beyond the dividend payment. And so Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks that in the current quarter, we expect to pay down another $300 million of debt. So, the debt is coming down nicely. We’ve done some nice things to remove some of the dilution that comes from those convertibles that we’ve retired from the structure and we’re pretty happy with the transactions that we executed built in the March quarter and the June quarter. And that ongoing run rate rates probably about $78 million and that will reduce as the interest expense comes down through debt repayments.
Gary Mobley: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you for the question. [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Chris Caso with Raymond James. please go ahead.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Just a couple of clarifications here. Your revenue guidance is suggesting about a 6% year-on-year decline with all of the puts and takes that we’ve talked about. Do you think that down 6% a year is an accurate reflection of what your customer’s consumption really is that sort of the baseline that we should be using here? And as we look forward into the December quarter, based on what you’re seeing in bookings, does that provide you with any degree of confidence that we’d see a sequential increase as we go into December? Or is that just too tough to call given that the short nature of the orders that you’re receiving now?
Eric Bjornholt: I’ll take the first part of that question and I think, the revenue based on selling that we report, we also tell you the end-market demand number, which is based on sell-through. They’re not that far apart now, those two numbers that come really fairly well together. they were wide apart when we were predicting for inventory two years ago. So, if we’re down 6% in September quarter guidance versus September quarter of last year that basically represents the market demand today. So that was the first part of your question. The second part was, what do we expect for number? Is that what you’re trying to say?
Chris Caso: Yes. And given the fact, it sounded like the orders improved in July. I suppose of that filling into the December quarter. But that you also mentioned that that the order rates were – the aging of the orders was very short – it was very short. So perhaps you’re not getting the same visibility, you’re getting this – now that you would in a typical quarter. And perhaps that makes it more difficult to call.
Steve Sanghi: I would say, in this kind of environment, we can barely call September, we can’t really call December. It will depend on what happens in the COVID situation, does the vaccine come out, will those fears will go away. Does everybody go back to work, all factories remain open, schools open. There is lot of ground to cover between now and October before the December quarter starts. So I would say, I’m not willing to say much about December yet.
Chris Caso: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Raji Gill with Needham and Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Raji Gill: Yes. Thanks. You might’ve answered this in the past question, but just to kind of repeat. So we entered into the June quarter, we felt kind of a dramatic reversal plus 9% going to minus 1.3%. And as we go into September we’re seeing a reversal in the other direction going from minus 8% to about minus 4%. And so those were reversals either positive or negative. If you were to sum it up, it’s primarily based on this complete lack of visibility that your customers are getting and basically operating on very short lead times.
Steve Sanghi: It’s basically there. We serve six end markets. Every end market is affected differently by COVID-19. Automotive being the worst and industrial being the next and on the other end, the best market was the data center and medical, some of the work from home computing and all that. So each market is affected very differently by COVID-19. And backlog almost by end markets, how the customers are behaving is quite different. And I think it’s really basically all driven by that. So, what we are seeing today is the bookings today are not bad to really what we need to ship this week and next week and next week. But we’re not getting – back in May and June, we were not getting enough bookings for August and September and October. So today we’re planning good booking for – in July, we got good bookings for July, August and September, but not enough yet for the next quarter. So as we proceed in the quarter, especially when we are in August and September, not only we need to get the bookings to fill the August and September that has a hole in it, we also got to get enough bookings. So on October 1, we start the next quarter correctly. And December quarter is also frontend loader, because December is a short month because of all the holidays. And it’s really just COVID-19 is controlling the people’s emotions and purchasing managers habits and everything else.
Raji Gill: And so my follow-up, in terms of the gross margin, so with revenue being down 4% sequentially gross margins are holding flat sequentially, despite revenue declining, even though data center is appearing to kind of revert back to normal patterns. I presume data center might be a higher gross margin product. So can you just talk a little puts and takes in terms of the mix shift that’s happening – utilization rates that are happening? Why is margin being flat, which is a good thing, despite revenue coming down?
Steve Sanghi: So, Eric do you want to take that one?
Eric Bjornholt: Sure. I can. So just maybe start by just reiterating that, we’re pretty proud about how the gross margins have piled up. And the last couple of years we’ve experienced the various things that China trade and now COVID. Even with our $13.9 million underutilization charge still posted 61.7% gross margin this last quarter. So there’s always things with product mix that impact gross margin utilization levels and all those things. We see pretty good stability this quarter, the midpoint of guidance, as you said, it’s flat sequentially. And we’ve given a little bit broader range of gross margin guidance than we normally do between 61.2% and 62.2%. So a percent range there, but we’ve got a pretty wide range of revenue also that we’re guiding to between flat and down 8%. So a lots of puts and takes, but we’re continuing to do all the right things to keep costs under control, bring things in-house where we can to improve the cost structure. Gross margin, I think is really kind of highlight in the cycle in terms of how well they’ve been maintained.
Raji Gill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, in the press release and in the comments that you made in your prepared remarks today, you seem to attribute the slower pace of bookings, at least partly to resurgence in COVID. And I think what some investors are concerned about is that instead the slowdown may be related to customers having over ordered in the recent past Microchip’s delivery against that and then customers have to digest it. Meanwhile, you seem to have had some pretty deep conversations with customers to figure out sort of end market expectations for the full year. So I’m wondering if perhaps you have a sense from those discussions, what customer inventory levels are like. Now it’s seems to me, if they’re ordering on very short lead times, they’re probably ordering for production and not for safety stock, but any insight in this regard would really help. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Well, we do business with 120,000 customers and long tail. Well over 100,000 of them buy from hundreds of distributors around the world. We’re not aware of any broad based holding of inventory by our customers and our distributor inventories are still in the range of being 15-year lows. Again, 120,000 plus end customers, we’re really not able to assess the inventory situation in each one of our customers, but we have a generally good sense of the inventory in the market. We’ve done a good job of keeping our lead time short and maintaining our delivery performance at a reasonable level. If the customers were had hold their inventories in the prior quarter or so we wouldn’t be getting so many short term requests and in some cases, customers are paying, expedite charge to get those cars. And there’s no reason customers will be paying expedited charges to get the parts, if they didn’t need them for production. In many, many cases, we’re delivering right on the factory floor. They are short circuiting shipment methods and they drop it on my floor because it aligns down situation. So if anything, inventory is not high out there, inventory is low.
William Stein: Yes. That’s super helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Chris Danely with Citigroup.
Chris Danely: Thanks guys for squeezing me in. Just a quick one. Can you give us approximately what percentage of revenue goes through China and how that’s done over the last few quarters?
Steve Sanghi: Eric, do you have that?
Eric Bjornholt: Yes, so it’s 21%, 22% of our revenue shifts into China. And obviously there’s some of that that’s local consumption and some of that that comes back to the Americas or Europe for consumption, but it’s in that 21%, 22% range.
Chris Danely: Okay. Thanks guys.
Steve Sanghi: So, Chris, in the June quarter, China revenue snapped back to higher level as the COVID-19 situation improved in China and business activities, supporting local consumption appear to be much more normal in China.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. In response to the muted demand environment back in the June quarter, you guys did cut back the number of manufacturing hours for your fab employees in your two U.S. fabs. I think it went from like an – it went from like a 13-week work week – work quarter to like an 11-week work quarter. What’s the demand trend scheme muted? Are you guys continuing to drive an 11-week manufacturing work quarter? Or are you guys taking down work hours and utilizations further here in the September quarter? And then just as a follow-up, it looks like Philippines is reimposing some of the regional lockdowns and resurgence of COVID-19 is just having an impact on the Philippines test operations.
Steve Sanghi: So I’ll take that first part of the question. I think you may have missed the comment earlier, but I did say in my remarks that actually our inventory last quarter came down 217 days from the 120 days before. Remember, we went into the quarter guiding to be down minus 6%. So if you were down minus 6%, our inventory would have gone up, which we did not want, so we put the rotating time off in the factory, at least in the two largest fabs to really have operators take some time off. And so we did better than revenue was only being down minus 1.3% and we cut back on the production. So the combined effect of that, where the inventory actually came down. Over the 117 days inventory, we have now adjusted the factory schedule, where we’re no longer working the rotating time off in those two large fabs. There are lots of small, small plants we inherited from Microsemi around the world in Boston and Ireland and Germany and other places. Those are all small labs and each one has their own schedule. Some of them are working short weeks because demand on certain products is weak. But the big plants are no longer working short hours. And second part of your question was the Philippines. Ganesh, you want to take that one.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. So we did – we are aware of the adjustments the Philippines is making. What we have not given you much color on is, at the May conference call, I mentioned that we’ve had, people who are effectively live in the Philippines factory, we’ll run our operations there for a significant portion of certainly, March and April. And at its peak, we had about 850 employees living in our factory to be able to work around the constraints. It has come down since then we still maintain a force of about 300 people that are there gives us a strategic flexibility on any short term constraints. And so we have planned for where this might go and what other actions may be taken and that we are not, unless something different happens, but what we expect is likely to happen. We feel we have the control and what we need to do while keeping Philippines running.
Harlan Sur: Yes. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Ganesh.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes. I guess good execution at tough environment. Just wondering on your September quarter guide for down four of the midpoint, are you seeing any particular weakness when you look by segment, I’ve seen storage the computer data center being a little bit more weaker or on industrial to give some more color there.
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh, we answered that question before. But go ahead take it again.
Ganesh Moorthy: So, as I mentioned, some of the segments that who are strong in the June quarter were driven by the work-from-home and medical type of activities, which have very short surge of demand that was required. That’s what had us running in the June quarter to try and catch up with a lot of new orders that came in as well. We are anticipating – the trends, we’re seeing is some of that surge subsides and demand begins to revert back to normal at that point in time. So in that sense, I wouldn’t call it a weak demand, but I would call it, it doesn’t have the surge that the June quarter had required as you continue to go long in time. And likewise, on the opposite side, some of the things that were really weak automotive being one example of that also begins to correct in the opposite direction when it begins to make up for some of that weakness as factories run, as demand returns and that part of business gets stronger.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And I know you’ve mentioned not able to meet all the demand coming through given the short-term nature of these orders, spurt of orders, I guess. Do you see any risk of losing orders or losing share, or just wondering if that’s part of it or is it just limited visibility on the part of the customer? Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: These are all proprietary products. These aren’t product that you switch overnight and go between sources and all that. So, no, we don’t see any list of losing share in what’s going on. And as I said, we’re working constructively with our customers to be – to try and get the best visibility they have to us as well, and to be able to serve them in order to meet their demand requirements. And so these are short term issues caused by the demand and supply shocks in the system. I don’t expect these to be long-term issues.
Vijay Rakesh: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.
Christopher Rolland: Thanks for the question. And this one’s really for Steve. Switching gears, we now have ADI acquiring Maxim. Do you see this changing anything for the analog market? And what are your feelings generally on consolidation? Do you expect to continue this pace or even accelerate during COVID? And if you had a view of valuations for targets in the industry right now, that would be appreciated as well. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Okay. Well, thanks for the question. We ourselves do not see any threat from the proposed acquisition of Maxim by ADI. They’re both strong competitors in the analog space and we compete against both of them on a regular basis. And when they get combined – anytime an acquisition happens, we always see incremental opportunities that arise, because sometimes the customer wants to defend sources or don’t want all their business with ADI and Maxim as they become one. So some opportunities appear that we’ll be able to take advantage of it. In terms of the merger environment, it really – it looks at times that it could slowdown. And if a large acquirers are digesting at one-time look like it will be difficult to get approvals from China, but then we got a flurry of approvals. Marvell got approved, IDT got approved, the Mellanox got approved. And now it is Maxim and Cyprus got approved. So if China continues to approve these deals and there are still acquirers who are willing to acquire then the consolidation in the industry will continue. I think that’s really for sure. And the fundamental issue is, if you look at it over a long period of time, over the last 20 years, the overall growth of the semiconductor industry has been low to mid-single-digit. And that’s a tough environment to operate in. Every year, people get excited about one thing or the other, but all these various trends have come in. But a consolidated long-term, industry has struggled and anytime an industry struggles on the top line, then the stronger will acquire the weaker and consolidation will continue. So that’s really my view on consolidation. As for valuation question is concerned, I mean, look at the valuation Cyprus went for and Maxim event for – it just kind of keeps going higher and higher. And I think for most targets, the remaining targets, their stock price already reflects significant acquisition premium. But you wouldn’t convince their boards and their management that the acquisition premium is in there and that’s what drives a very, very high valuation. So that’s a problem.
Christopher Rolland: Insightful, thank you Steve.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: The next question will come from David O’Connor with Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
David O’Connor: Great. Thanks for sneaking me in guys. Maybe just a quick follow-up from a previous question, Steve, can you just remind us what the order mix is? What percentage of orders are typically short lead versus long lead time both historically versus currently, and I have one quick follow up. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: We don’t have the numeric, and I don’t think we would be willing to share it. It changes a lot week-to-week and month-to-month. And it’s a very fluid situation when you’re working with 100 of distributors and 120,000 plus customers. So we wouldn’t share that indicator.
David O’Connor: Okay. Fair enough. And as my follow-on, last quarter you said that the U.S Department of Commerce export ruling, it should be pretty much straightforward for you guys, you called out I think military, maybe some attention there. Is there anything that popped up from the implementation that you went to that was unexpected? Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh, you want to take that one?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes, there were no issues. There was obviously administrative procedures that need to be put in place or have our partners put in place and so all of that is done and behind us.
David O’Connor: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The question will come from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
Craig Ellis: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions guys. And the nice job on the execution of the quarter. Steve, I wanted to ask a question, I’ll start with you. It may ultimately go to Ganesh, but clearly the company has executed a number of things tactically with COGS management and OpEx management to really protect margin leverage at historically high levels through last year, so now this year’s crisis. The question is, as we look ahead and think about things that the company might be doing that are those ongoing continuous efforts to drive structural improvement and in COGS and OpEx, versus some of the things that will have some unwind employees going back to full salaries eventually as demand normalizes. How do we think about the gives and takes there? And maybe you can just list for us what some of the key longer-term drivers for contradiction and OpEx optimization are? That would be helpful. Thanks guys.
Steve Sanghi: Go ahead Ganesh, if you want to take that?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, obviously there are some costs that are short-term cost that we have taken out. We’ve listed many of them, I commented long, long, and as the fee revenue recurring is you should expect that some of those costs will come back. And you know, historically we have been disciplined about how we bring back some of these costs as revenue returns. And you can go back and look at other cycles in terms of how the percentage of revenue we manage our operating expenses. I think, one thing which we will do different as they come out of this, also look at what did we learn out of this crisis in terms of managing more effectively from an operating expense standpoint. And there we will get into changes in methodology, Eric mentioned to you perhaps travel, not being as higher rate as they used to, switching to more virtual methods for customer training and a number of other things as well. And so we are committed to the long-term targets we have, which is to get operating expenses down into the 23% range. That’s part of our 40.5% operating margin target that we’re working towards. And every bit and every quarter we learn things we can do more effectively, where it’s in research and development, and sales and marketing or in the overall general and administrative areas that sequentially brings things a bit-by-bit downs. We have been working on the last bit of the integration for Microsemi, which is predominantly at this point, focused on the business process and IT related items. We’re about nine months away from wrapping that up as the last bits of those get done. So there’s constant part of our DNA that is working on these in all three areas and in a crisis, you take some of the best learnings and make sure you capture them when you get past the crisis.
Craig Ellis: Got it. Thanks, Ganesh.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse, please go ahead.
John Pitzer: Yes. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Ganesh, you had mentioned the prepared comments that you thought FPGAs would be up pretty significantly in the September quarter. I’m just kind of curious, is that a business that’s more exposed to the auto market? And so what we’re saying is weak June in auto to strong June and September, and that’s driving it or are there other drivers there are, can you kind of a numerate please?
Ganesh Moorthy: So exposure to automotive for the FPGA business is low at this point. It’s one of the things that Microchip brought to that business with our historical strengths in terms of how we take advantage of each other’s end-market strengths. So if other parts of the market that are responding, providing growth in the September quarter and even as we expect that was one large customer that created a bounce for a lower revenue in the June quarter. We don’t expect they’re going to recover in the September quarter. In spite of the fact, we expect that the other improvements we’re making in business, the more than offset for that in the September, but it’s not automotive.
John Pitzer: Thank you. Thank you. I’ll now turn the conference back over to Steve Sanghi for any closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: So there is one other indicator I wanted to give you. We hadn’t planned on it, but I think with all the questions we got in how the bookings happen in last quarter versus what’s happening in this quarter. I’m going to go on the limb and give you this number. The July bookings were 15.5% higher than the May bookings per day, every month is not the same there are some minor differences. And July bookings were 36.6% higher per day than the June booking. So you could see how last quarter bookings were decreasing in May and then really fell precipitously in June. But the bookings were very short-term oriented. So we made the quarter actually beat the guidance in the quarter last quarter, but it started this quarter in a whole, but now this quarter, July bookings were 15.5% better than May and 36.6% better than June, that’s why we had the confidence that even though we started minus 8%, we’re going to end up lot better. Hopefully that helps you a little bit. With that we will be attending a number of virtual conferences in the coming days and weeks. And so we will talk to some of you in those conferences. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s event. Now disconnect your lines for the rest of your day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-05-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Microchip's Q4 and Fiscal 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participant's line are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And please be advised that today's call is being recorded. [Operator instructions]Now I would like to turn the conference over to your speaker today Mr. Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2020 financial performance. And Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.We are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website.I will now go through some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of acquisition activities, share based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.I will now go through some the operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.Net sales in the March quarter were $1.326 billion which was up 3% sequentially and above our revised guidance for March 02, 2020, but net sales were expected to be about flat sequentially. We've posted a summary of our GAAP net sales as well as end market demand by product line and geography on our website for your reference.On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were strong at 62%, operating expenses were at 25.4% and operating income was 36.6% compared to 35.1% in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $375.5 million, non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.46, which was up significantly from $1.32 for this in the prior quarter. On a GAAP basis in the March quarter, gross margins were 61.4% and include the impact of $5.1 million of share-based compensation and $3.3 million of COVID19 shelter in place restrictions on manufacturing activities, total operating expenses were $653.2 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $248.5 million special charges of $17.2 million, $15.3 million of acquisition related and other costs and share based compensation of $35.6 million.The GAAP net income was $99.9 million or $0.39 per diluted share. At March quarter GAAP tax benefit was impacted by a variety of factors including tax reserve releases associated with the statute of limitations expiring, deferred tax adjustments related to intercompany movement of intellectual property, tax reserve releases associated with tax audits and other matters.For fiscal year 2020 net sales were $5.274 billion. On a non-GAAP basis gross margin were a record 61.9%, operating expenses were 25.7% of sales and operating income was 36.2% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $1.44 billion and EPS was $5.62 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis gross margins were 61.5%, operating expenses were 49.2% of sales and operating income was 12.3% of sales. Net income was $570.6 million and EPS was $2.23 per diluted share.The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 7% in the March quarter and 6.3% for fiscal year 2020. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '21 to be between 6% and 7% exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with the restructuring, with the Microsemi operations in the Microchip's global structure and tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as US interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The future cash tax payments associated with the transition tax are expected to be about $245 million that we paid over the next six years. We posted a schedule of these projected transition tax payments on the IR page of our website.Our inventory balance at March 31, 2020 was $685.7 million. We had 122 days of inventory at the end of the March quarter down seven days from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the March quarter were at 29 days compared to 28 days at the end of December. We believe distribution inventory levels for Microchip are still quite low compared to historical averages.In the March quarter, we exchanged cash and shares of our common stock to retire $650 million of principal plus accrued interest of out 2025 convertible senior subordinated notes. The cash used to pay the principal on this exchange was funded by 364 day bridge loan. This exchange will significantly reduce your count solution to the extent Microchip stock price appreciates in the future.During the quarter, we also amended our credit facility. As disclosed in our March 21, 2020 press release, the total leverage and senior leverage covenants were favorably modified as part of the amendment giving Microchip greater financial flexibility. The cash flow from operating activities was $371.7 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $403 million. We paid down $236 million of total debt in the March quarter.Over the last seven full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we've paid down $2.222 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down the debt. We've accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our businesses as well as our ongoing operating discipline.We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the March quarter was $548.1 million and our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA was $2.129 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA excluding our very long dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity like in nature was $4.46 at March 31, 2020 and our dividend payment in the March quarter was $88 million.Capital expenditures were $11.9 million in the March quarter and $67.6 million for fiscal year 2020. We expect between $12 million and $18 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal '21 to be between $50 million and $70 million. We continue to add capital to maintain and operate our internal manufacturing operations, support the production capabilities for our new products and technologies as well as to selectively bring in house some of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced.We expect these capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the outsourced Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $41.8 million.I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. On a GAAP basis our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up 5.9% as compared to the December quarter. From an end market demand standpoint our microcontroller business was sequentially up 2.9%. From an end market standpoint [indiscernible] microcontrollers in the March quarter represent an all-time record of just over $349 or 47% of our microcontroller demand.We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers, including a new cryptography enabled 32 bit microcontroller designed to stop malware for systems that boot from flash memory as well as a new high end [indiscernible] microcontroller product family for improved designs in real-time control and connected applications. Microcontrollers overall represented 55.2% of our end market demand in the March quarter.Last month Gartner released their microcontroller market share report for 2019. We're pleased to report that Microchip retain the number one position 8-Bit or 8-Bit microcontrollers. Once again we gained market share as we grew faster in the overall 8-Bit market. In fact we are now twice as big as a number two player. In the 16-bit microcontroller market we remained at a number five position and continue to gain market share as we grew faster than the overall 16-bit microcontroller market:In the 32-bit microphone market, we remained at a number six position for the Gartner report and gained significant market share again as we grew faster than the overall 32-bit microphone market. These results are despite Gartner rolling up our 32-bit microcontroller revenues to be about $400 million lower than the $1.2 billion results we actually achieved in 2019.Had Gartner used our actual calendar year 2019 32-bit microcontroller results, we would have achieved a number four ranking and as I shared with you earlier our 32-bit microphone business in the March quarter ran at a approximately $1.36 billion annualized run rate based on end market demand. For microcontroller overall, we remained at a three number position despite Gartner rolling up our revenue to be about $400 million lower than our publicly reported results for calendar year 2019.By using our publicly reported results, we would be approximately 7.5% away from the number two player and 16.5% away from the number one player ahead of us as we continue to relentlessly march towards number one spot. Our microcontroller portfolio and roadmap had never been stronger. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share in 2020 as we farther build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.Now moving to analogue, on a GAAP basis our revenue was sequentially up 1.1% as compared to the December quarter. From an end market standpoint our analog business was sequentially down 1.8%. During the quarter, we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products, including the industry's first space qualified radiation tolerant Ethernet transceiver as well as an expanded silicon carbide family of power electronics to provide system level improvements in efficiency, size and reliability with 700 volt, 1200 volt and 1700 volt power modules. Analog represented 27.6% of our end market in the March quarter.Our FPGA revenue on a GAAP basis was up 4.6% sequentially as compared to the December quarter. From an end market demand standpoint our FPGA business was sequentially up 1%. FPGA represented 7% of our end market demand in the March quarter. Our licensing, memory and other product lines, which we refer to as LMO was sequentially down 10.7% as compared to the December quarter from an end market demand perspective.During the quarter we introduced a new miniaturized rubidium atomic clock, the industry's highest performance atomic clock for its size and power. LMO represented 10.1% of our end market demand in the March quarter. An update regarding coronavirus and its impact on our operations. We have had nine employees who tested positive for the virus with over 18,000 employees worldwide this was inevitable but thankfully they're all recovering nicely or have already recovered. Most of our non-factory employee base is working from home as we rapidly transformed business processes to run the marketing.Our global team have been highly engaged, collaborative and productive under the circumstances, resulting in enhanced customer engagement for new designs and high effectiveness in our product developed programs. We would like to thank our worldwide team for rapidly adapting to changing conditions and making the best of workflows possible under difficult circumstances to continue delivering results.Our manufacturing operations have varying degrees of constraint last quarter as what started the China shutting down for several weeks, expanded to many other locations that shutdown. Our operations team minimally adjusted to constraint as they emerge and implement our contingency plans where needed, to ensure that we continue to serve customer needs despite the challenges. In most of our manufacturing locations, we were able to get essential services designation as our products are quite ubiquitous in medical, work from home, defense and communication infrastructure applications.Our Philippines operations had the largest impact with restriction of people movement, being so strict that we've had a large number of our dedicated employees living in our two factory there since mid-March to support production and customer shipments. Our global team also successfully worked through a myriad of ground and air logistics issues throughout the quarter as conditions change regionally over time.Our customers and our supply chain partners also endure constraints with their factories and logistics have made the March quarter challenging. We are appreciative of our global people engaged and work through a rolling step of customer and supplier challenges even as we work through challenge and constraints have a place on our own factories.Pandemics are inherently unpredictable and there maybe yet other twists and turns to come in the days ahead. We continue to process the news daily as well as monitor information from the center for disease control and the World Health Organization and we will adopt our response as needed and focus on the things that we can control.Given the current market uncertainties, we are providing some qualitative insight into our principal end markets. The area of strength we see are data center driven by continued strength from the exponential rate at which data has been created and the consequent seemingly insatiable with demand for data storage. For computers, printers, monitors and other accessories enabled by the increased shift to working from home, for medical devices COVID19 related items like ventilators, respirators, oxygen monitor and ultrasound machines but also a host of other hospital equipment needed for increased patient loads.For contact-free consumer and industrial product like hands-free dispensers or soap, water, paper, hand sanitizers for infrared thermometers as well as barcode readers for retail shopping all in an attempt to prevent the spread of COVID19 and then for communication infrastructure in part because of work from home related network loading changes but also in part due to stimulus investments in infrastructure especially in China. The area of the weakness we've seen from an end market perspective on automotive, broad based industrial, consumer home appliances and aviation or aerospace. Our defense and space business remains relatively even here.Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh and good afternoon, everyone. Today I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 and the whole fiscal year 2020. I'll then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2021. The March quarter had unusual business challenges as the effects of COVID19 pandemic unfolded in many dimensions. I'm proud of how rapidly the Microchip team adapted to the new constraints we faced so that our employees would be safe, our customers will be well served and our partners engage to ensure mutual success despite the challenges we face.Despite the COVID19 pandemic challenges we deliver 3% sequential net sales growth as compared to our early March updated guidance, which was for net sales to be about flat. Our final March quarter GAAP net sales came in at $1.326 billion up 3% percent sequentially and down just to 0.3% from a year ago March quarter. Our end market demand based on sell-through was approximately $3.8 million lower than GAAP sales.After seven quarters of end market demanding higher than selling based net sales, March quarter was nearly even for end market demand versus selling net sales. We also delivered outstanding non-GAAP gross margin of 52% just above the high-end of our original guidance from February 04, 2020 and non-GAAP operating margin of 36.6% near the high-end of our original guidance and we did all that while reducing our days of inventory from 129 days to 122 days.Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was $1.46. We did not provide EPS guidance when we revised our net sales guiding on March 02, 2020. Our original non-GAAP EPS guidance provided with our earnings release on February 04, 2020 was $1.35 to $1.51 with the midpoint of $1.43 and we beat the original guidance by $0.03. On a non-GAAP basis this was also our 118 consecutive profitable quarter.In the March quarter, we paid down $236 million of our debt. Our total debt payment since the end of June 2018 has been about $2.22 billion. The pace of debt payments have been strong despite the week and uncertain business conditions underlining the strong cash generation characteristics of our business as well as our active efforts to continue to squeeze working capital efficiency. On a full fiscal year 2020 basis our net sales was $5.274 billion down 1.4% over fiscal year 2019.Now I'll discuss our guidance for the June quarter. Ganesh in his prepared remarks discussed the impact we are seeing on our supply chain as well as our customers. Ganesh also described the end markets where we are seeing strength and those where we are seeing either current or expected weakness. Our March quarter bookings were up double digit percentage over the December quarter booking. The book-to-bill ratio for March quarter was very strong at 1.17. That resulted in our starting backlog for June quarter to be strong compared to the starting backlog for the March quarter.In April H 2020 press release, we said that we believe that the strength in bookings maybe a result of customer concerns about supply chain disruption due to COVID19 virus. With economies around the world contracting rapidly with millions of people getting laid out and with customer factory closures due to sheltering place, ordinances in various countries we believe that product demand is likely to weaken significantly.With another month under our belt now, we have seen some of the customer order pushouts and cancellations. Our backlog for the June quarter compared to the backlog for March quarter at the same point in time has now deteriorated somewhat in the last month. We believe the backlog position compared to March quarter will continue to deteriorate due to the combined effects of supply chain disruption, customer factory closures and demand destruction. Taking all these factors into consideration, we expect our net sales for June quarter to be down 2% to 10% sequentially.The guidance ranges to help account for the uncertainty associated with the evolving coronavirus situation. We have no way to model how the rest of the quarter will play out for the coronavirus situation and what the consequent business impact may be but we believe that our guidance range incorporates our best judgment for the possible scenarios. We have prepared the company for a downside scenario by putting the employees on a 10% salary cut and are adjusting the factory by reduced work hours or rotating time offs. We have also frozen all business travel and cut discretionary expenses.Regarding CapEx, we finished fiscal year 2020 with a CapEx of $67.6 million, a significant reduction from fiscal year '19 CapEx of $229 million. This is consistent with what we have said before that our CapEx is divided between growth capital, maintenance capital and new products and technology capital. In a fiscal year like 2020 in which our net sales declined, the growth capital which is the largest portion of CapEx declines to virtually nothing and therefore the total CapEx declined significantly. We expect CapEx for fiscal year '21 to remain low in the range of $50 million to $70 million.For June quarter we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 60.4% and 61.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 24.4% and 25.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 35.2% and 36.8% of sales and we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.25 per share to $1.45 per share.We believe that despite the near-term pandemic-driven challenges, we are confident in the strength and diversity of the businesses and end markets we are in to achieve long-term growth in excess of the average semiconductor market growth. Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis except for net sales which will be on a GAAP basis.We believe that non-GAAP provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates through first call.With that operator, will you please poll for questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions].
Eric Bjornholt: Yeah I don’t think that's possible. Let's stay open here for a while. Our Investor Relations manager is just indicating that we're having quite a few problems here. So let's hold and see if we can this solved. I know there is questions to be asked. So I've been told we have 12 questions in queue. We just need to figure out how to get them available so those questions can be asked/
Operator: Your first question is from the line of Chris Caso from Raymond James. Sir please go ahead.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Appreciate that. So I guess for the first question, Steve if you could give us some thoughts about perhaps the magnitude of the downturn that I guess we're all expecting. I realize that's a difficult question with what's going on with the backlog here, but I guess compare with some of your competitors have compared what we're seeing now to the 2009 cycle. I'm not sure if that's the right way to look at it right now, but I guess Microchip is also a different company as compared 2009 and what you're guiding to is not quite as bad. As we put all that together, how are you thinking about things going forward?
Ganesh Moorthy: So I think we're really unable to speak about anybody else's business but our own. We mentioned some of the companies, I believe all companies have a different end market and customer exposure. We have been building this franchise for many years now through organic efforts as well as acquisitions and have compiled the very large number of very, very good assets and then deployed a program called TSS, Total System Solutions that we have discussed with you in which we are garnering larger and larger share of the customer's board with our product.So the outperformance that you may be seeing from us in business today is really nothing to do with what we have done today or last year it's been a result of really many years of effort and new products organically as well as through acquisitions and our customer support, customer support activities, the distributor relationships and everything else over the past several years. I don’t know if that helps you.
Chris Caso: Okay I guess perhaps you could take us through what you've seen in the order rates and you put through some of that in your prepared remarks about what you've been seeing since March. I guess what's interesting now is that the customers came in, the channel at least came into this crises with very low inventory levels and that's I guess unusual in a downturn in our industry. How does that affect things going forward and what sort of visibility do you have on what customers may be doing with the inventory levels here?
Ganesh Moorthy: So this is a very unique cycle. We have for the first time ever we're experiencing a demand shock and a supply shock. We have seen demand shock before like 2008, 2009 cycle you mentioned. We also saw a major demand shock during the 2001 tech burst and I think we saw a little mini demand shock really even during SARS in 2004 or 2003 whenever it was. And we have seen some supply shocks from our industry the two that I remember, one was during tsunami in Japan and Southeast Asia where we have a number of factories were closed down or shut down and there was a major demand shock and the other demand shock I recall was during the major floods in Thailand a few years ago where many of our peers factories were under water. Microchip factory was okay though.So we've seen really either a supply shock or a demand shock. This in the first time ever in my 40 years of experience that I am seeing a simultaneous demand shock and supply shock. The supply shock is driven by this various shelter in place ordinances and Ganesh talked about it extensively, Philippines being the worst and Malaysia being the second where we could get our workers into the factory and in some cases, the workers are living in the factory believe they believe they will not be able to come back and number of our product lines that ran in those factories produced limited output because the whole workforce wasn't working. That resulted into a supply shortage and a supply shock in some of the lead times run out and that drove some of the demand further from customers and distributors.And on the demand side of it, our customer's factories shut down, the worst being in the automotive business where I think you guys keep track of file data and if you look at the file data, you'll find that Europe has been the worst and US the second and lot of factories were shut down in Asia also but those factories are coming back in automotive. So the automotive business is going through this [indiscernible] demand shock and industrial somewhat and while on the other had like you look at the market like data centers where demand shock is in the upward direction with all the data and work from home ordinances their demand has gone up and the other area which is really quite sleepy for us in general, I don't think it's a very large percentage of our business is medical. We melt that into industrial, the medical is really we contact in industrial but a month and a half ago, I wouldn't know what a ventilator was and now we found that all the ventilator designs around the world ,everyone is using our products and the demand has gone up 100X if not more.The hospital will have two to three ventilators only for emergency purposes and now a single hospital is requiring 1,000 to 2,000 ventilators. So that demand has gone up 50X to 100X. Same thing on digital thermometers to automatic soap dispensers and bathroom products that when you put your hand into the soap falls down, they all use microcontrollers or senses or many of our products. So that's kind of the end market here.So in certain markets demand is very strong. In other market, demand is very weak. In some cases they're impacted because of supply chain disruption, in other cases the impact is because of stronger demand. So I think you know how do you make sense with all that? We started June quarter with a very strong backlog and our backlog for June quarter is still higher than our backlog was for the March quarter at the same point in time, but it has deteriorated significantly compared to where it was on April 1 and at the rate we're seeing customer's adjustments, push outs and cancellation where the customer may have ordered more product really shows up that this deterioration in backlog in June compared to March will continue.We know how much we lost in one monthly. We got two more months to go and putting all that into the equation really our crystal ball tells us in the midpoint of minus six and it end up minus two to minus 10. Sorry for the long answer but the question deserved it.
Chris Caso: I think that's the discussion we're looking for.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava. Sir, your line is open.
Ambrish Srivastava: Lot of details there. Can you focus on the gross margin and just how those understand the dynamics, it's more than hanging in the slide to you actually drawing down lowering inventory on the balance sheet the inventory didn't really go by that, but kind of help us understand the factors there seems to be a structural change in Chris asked the question about the difference between Microchip from 10 years ago and all the stuff we've followed you for a while but just talk through the structural changes and then you mentioned that with some manufacturing the CapEx which enable you to bring more Microsemi and Atmel indoor and that will have some positive and this is obviously a longer-term question that I am asking thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: So let me ask Eric Bjornholt will answer that question and I'll add something if needed at the end. Go ahead Eric.
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. Gross margins held up extremely well in the March quarter and we closed 62% non-GAAP margin because it was really outstanding. As you know we've been running our factories at less than optimal levels and we reported a underutilization charge in the quarter of about $14 million. That was actually $3 million better than the prior quarter as we were running our assembly and test factories further than we have in the previous quarters and we were draining finished goods.So the strong gross margins are really driven by a variety of factors, including attainable product mix and then just ongoing cost reduction and cost containment activities in our factories. So that term quarter we're guiding the gross margin to be down at 60.8% at the midpoint. We expect higher underutilization charges in June compared to March due to some of the rotating time off that we're going to be doing in the factories and just lower production output. But we believe we're really well positioned for the long-term with gross margin improvement in the future as we grow back into our factory capacity.So there is a number of things that influence that other than the factory capacity. We've been also doing a good job of really holding average selling price flat with our customers and that has long-term gross margin benefits also. So that's the general summary there. Steve, what would you like to add?
Steve Sanghi: No I think that's good. This down cycle, let me add a couple of sentences. I think we started this down cycle with probably the lowest inventory we had, 122 days at the end of March. I recall prior down cycle when we started with really high inventory and so I think it's such a low inventory and we're keeping the flow by factory rotating time offs and other.So I think when we get on the other side of it and start ramping up factory back up and we're starting with the gross margin in the 60's I think we'll be very, very well positioned longer term, but it really good record gross margin.
Eric Bjornholt: The second piece of Ambrish's question related to CapEx and we will still focus longer-term on bringing some more assembly and test in-house but we're really locked down capital pretty significantly to see where our forecast is for fiscal '21 of between $50 million and $70 million. So where there is benefits to be gained, we'll evaluate those, but we're being pretty conservative of our posture in terms of making adjustments right now.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo Securities. Sir your line is open.
Gary Mobley: In the interest of time, I'll post my questions now. Steve you gave your opinion on the recent export -- recent change in export control rules and the impact this may have on the owners process of applying for licenses to shift China customers or any sort of limitations on that and then my next question really on behalf of many different people, but I would interested to get your perspective on how safe your dividend is, thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Sure, I'll pass on to Ganesh to answer the question about export control and then I'll come back and answer the question on the dividend.
Ganesh Moorthy: As a recent announcement that was made, we're still sorting through what the Commerce Department's rules are. The specific item that we are paying attention to the possible military use of products and how we can provide confirmation that it is not going with those applications. We think it's fairly straightforward to be able to do it but we have time until the 29 June to be able to implement it but at this point in time we do not expect that it has an issue in terms of Microchip's business. Go ahead Steve.
Steve Sanghi: So regarding the dividend, your question was how safe is the dividend. Dividend is very, very safe. We were one company that did not cut over dividend back in 2009 when peak to bottom our revenue went down almost 36%. Today we're so much more profitable on gross and operating margin level, we have done a stress test on our business you can't find a number lowering up, you could lose a very, very large amount of sales and the company still is cash flow positive with regard $1.2 billion of money remaining on line of credit.So I think really we are unable to model a scenario, a reasonable scenario where the dividend would be at risk and if we felt that the dividend was at risk we certainly would not be increasing the dividend which we are little bit every quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.
Craig Hettenbach: Question for Steve just on kind of the downturn playbook and so that the employee cost cuts, pay reduction in CapEx you’ve done it in prior cycles, as you mentioned this is a very different cycle. So just trying to gauge how you're thinking about the depth of this cycle and similar things you're doing to protect margin as it plays out.
Steve Sanghi: So I think we learn a little bit through every cycle and one of our goal is to never let a cycle go to waste. What happened in 2008, 2009 was the cycle really hit in early part of October of 2008 and the business was down very substantially in that December quarter and down lot more even in the March quarter and we didn't implement pay cuts and all that till we were well into the cycle where the strong authority there and we were being better just.So this time what we've done in understanding that with 33 million people I think already lost jobs in US alone, I don’t know how many around the world. These people are not going to be buying cars and refrigerators and other stuff that really would have our product. So this time we bend down the hatches and got it up the window. They're ahead of time before the storm really hit.So we finished the March quarter actually sequentially up 3% and we implemented the pay cut starting April 20 and at that time our business really hasn't even weakened. Where our June quarter was still backlog higher than the March quarter backlog at the same point in time. So what we have really done is really out of abundance of caution just thinking that this storm internally at Microchip we have described that to be a category fixed storm waiting in the wing where category five is the highest category because we have never seen this before and a simultaneous demand and supply shock the pandemic and no place to hide and 33 million people laid up in the five weeks in US alone.So we have prepared the company with a cost structure in the June guidance we have given you has the paycheck now pay cuts for June quarter dialed in but not for the whole quarter because we started in the middle of the quarter and September expense will be down even slightly further from that. So we essentially have positioned it for any extreme case that may materialize.It's a lot easy to give the money back undo the cuts on the salary, change them from X% to Y% lower that. It's much easier to do that than you have spent all the money and then really fight and you have the supply. So that's really how we're looking at it. We're looking at it as don't know and until anybody knows, anybody says he knows. they're lying. They don't. So what we've done in really out of abundance of caution prepared the company for a worst case analysis and we'll give the money back if we didn’t need it.
Craig Hettenbach: Just as a follow-up on the push outs and cancellations, is it pretty broad based are there any certain products that are you're seeing more than others?
Steve Sanghi: It's not by product. It is more by end market. The worst is automotive, the second would be industrial and general consumer like appliances and all that I think that Ganesh described all those areas, where the strength is the strongest area is data center. I would think the next is really 5G related, work from home related, PCs, printers, computers and all that. Medical is extremely strong. So those are the areas we're not seeing push outs and cancellation. We're seeing those in the automotive and some general industry.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.
John Pitzer: Steve you said in your prepared comments, that clearly, the June backlog is deteriorating, but at least through the month of April, it would still suggest the potential for sequential growth in the June quarter. So I am just curious when you think about the range of revenue you've given for June. What's the expectation as we go into May and June? Does the rate of deterioration, the backlog needs to accelerate from here to kind of hit your midpoint or just kind of give us any sort of color you feel comfortable with helping us understand what you're embedding in further deterioration of the backlog from here?
Steve Sanghi: There is a way to model it. So there are two challenges, maybe three. One is that the existing backlog further cancels or pushes out the following quarter. Second is we still need turns to take. If there is zero cancellation from here on, but we get no more turns for the quarter, that's not a good scenario either. So that would be fairly soft too and the third is a supply depending on what product the demand comes on.The products where if you place an order today the earliest I can give you is July, August and those are from the most constrained areas or factories that have had a six weeks for six weeks they haven’t been able to run full production and now as they're coming back to production, we are so far behind in delinquency. We'll leave the June quarter with a fairly large amount of product delinquent. Same thing happened at the end of March quarter.So in a way some day when we catch up on that product get shipped, it's a good news but for now we're not going to be able to ship all the backlog in the June quarter, neither will be able to ship that all in March quarter. In fact, if just the supply side shock had not happened and our factories were running, for March quarter we would have met or exceeded our original guidance, which was about 5%, 5.5%. We only did three and I was largely because we couldn’t supply the product.
John Pitzer: That's helpful Steve and you also mentioned that some of the OpEx control that you put in place this quarter or not even for the full quarter so it will have a positive effect on OpEx declining again in September. I'm curious, are there more leverage you can pull on OpEx and should we take OpEx being down sequentially in September as a sign that you feel like revenue might be down again in September as well?
Ganesh Moorthy: So the only reason that the September OpEx will be down below June would be because the pickup would be for the entire quarter and the pickups didn’t kick in until June 20 in US and probably May 1 for some of the international geographies depending on the various international laws but the September quarter we get the full quarter.If your question is what if we didn’t need it and the business as well then you remodel it and you change the pickup from 10% to 6% to 5% or if you see growth you make it zero. Anything is possible, but I'm saying right now in the game prepared for the category fixed on we are structured to take the June quarter expenses below the March quarter because of the full quarter saying and then December compared to September will be about the same if you don’t make any change in and the pickup and at the end of December that's currently the case.We've announced the employees that the pickup ends at the end of December, So the March quarter OpEx will rise again and hopefully we're well out of the words from the site and if we're not then we do something different.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi. Sir your line is open.
Chris Danely: Can you just expend on I guess what percentage of your revenue is dealing with the supply issues and are the supply issues worsening as we speak or do you think you got a handle on them and they should get better as the quarter progresses?
Steve Sanghi: Let me have Ganesh comment on it. I don’t think we have quantitative numbers but Ganesh can talk qualitatively.
Ganesh Moorthy: So it's not our entire product line right. So we build a lot of product in many countries Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia depending on our factory or subcontracted factories. Our principal issues from a constraint standpoint were in the Philippines and in Malaysia. Malaysia at this point effectively has turned on 100%. They don't have -- it's running at 100% but there are no restriction and they are as fast as they can bring their direct labor workforce how they would catch up on the quarter.Philippines has done operating under restriction. We have been able to improve from March to the June quarter by having more people residing in our factories. So this is we got 500, 600 employees living full-time inside the factory to be able to get the utilization to be higher. We expect that that will get turned -- those restrictions will come off as we go into the latter part of May, the middle of May as part of our control and as that happens, we will have more output that come out of it.So I believe the constraint -- manufacturing constraints are coming off and coming off rapidly, but there's catch up to what was left from where the constraints were there plus ongoing support there.
Chris Danely: And for my follow-up, so Steve you call this weakness after a little bit of strength last quarter. What is your spider sense tell you on how long this weakness could last? Do you think that some of these end markets that are very strong right now like data center, did they start getting weaker in the second half of the year. Any guesses to how long this weakness could last because it last in the next quarter.
Steve Sanghi: I don’t currently expect the data center to weaken and I think 90% of the world data has been created in the last two years and any company that's related together I just got off the Board of Mellanox, you've got finally the deal closed and they're video on April 27 and then announced the prior quarter their March quarter just couple of days before the deal closed. It was a very, very strong quarter. You’ve seen it in the results and video also.So I just think data center market is very, very strong and I think how we've designed in our print position and the customers board. So that one looks very, very good. But I think as the automotive factories go back to work and people start buying cars again, that market is the most destroyed today. That market will show huge potential for getting back to normal and industrial will be the same way.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: I had two as well. Steve when I look at your peak to trough share decline say from September last year to hopefully the tough in June or if I just take the midpoint of what you're guiding to in June or even take the low end of that, it's a introduction of 7% to 11% that's actually much better than what we have seen at some of your analogue and microcontroller peers that are down 25% in that same period.So the question to you is what is helping you stay more resilient and I appreciate the visibility is not there but if let's say those competitors start to come in September, is there anything that prevents Microchip sales to also rebound in September?
Steve Sanghi: I think I little bit answered that question earlier that we think what we're seeing is you referred and building is stronger same position and customer's boards with total system solutions and also acquiring product lines with synergy products what we have gotten from Atmel and Micrel and Microsemi with all the discrete product line with various steps that can grow into similar border microcontroller and much stronger distributor relationships I think some others have been tweaking their distribution policies maybe to the detriment, maybe not now. Time will tell but I think we are seeing a stronger effect of a stronger distributor relationships and the effect of end markets like we discussed.So I don't really know why anybody else is doing better or worse than us. I am sure there are other companies doing better than us and rather more closer competitors that are doing worst than us. So we're happy to be gaining share but I don’t know we can totally allocate percentage how much is because of what reason.
Vivek Arya: And for my follow-up, gross margin say you're guiding down about 120 basis points or so down to 61%. I understand that there are supply chain disruptions etcetera, but the last time your gross margins were under or around these 61%-ish or below levels, your revenues were 20% lower right. They were closer to $1 billion or so over two years ago and at that time you did not even have Microsemi which has been accretive to margin since then.So I am curious why this conservatism and gross margin as with utilization is there anything else right and then how should gross margins behave assuming that sales start to rebound in September? Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: So the midpoint of our guidance this quarter is 60.8%. Our long-term model is 63%. So quite honestly I think margins have held up extraordinarily well. If you look at the fall we had in gross margins back in 2008, 2009 that margins went down significantly. Now we've got a little more balance between what we do internally versus what we do externally from a production standpoint.Bottom line is with revenue being down as you mentioned 7% to 11% from people trough we have to run our factories at low level and I think we've done a very good job of controlling inventory levels and in this last quarter 122 days that's a very good position to be in with what's in front of us. So I think this comes down to utilization of our factory footprint that we have as we go back into it, we can be very cost effective.
Vivek Arya: It's just a trough though.
Ganesh Moorthy: I think the question revenue is so much higher than last time our revenue was -- last time our margin was just kind of number. So why is margin not higher I think that's your question. Going back two years ago was a different company. We didn’t have Microsemi all of their factories around the world they're probably a different cost structure. Some of those factories have lower demand. Some of those are okay and it's not the same company. Combined with Microsemi now, Microsemi was about between 40% to 50% of our revenue and company has totally changed.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Sir please go ahead.
William Stein: Steve I apologize if you’ve answered this already. It seems clear you are expecting some further order cancels or push out or downsizing, so I totally understand that but when we think about the pace of cancellations, have you commented on that yet? Is that starting to slow down where the reduction in backlog is getting to point where those changes are smaller and smaller?
Steve Sanghi: I don’t know if I can definitely say that. I think end market by end market and it's geography by geography, but overall it may have slowed down somewhat but in some other geographies and in some other markets its continuing. So I don't think, if the calculations were over and the push outs were over, our revenue would be higher than March quarter. That's not what we're guiding and that's not where we're attempting.
William Stein: Next one if I can, perhaps for Eric but whoever wants to take it, most semi companies in the past few months has couple of months have taken to try to term out debt and either protect themselves on the balance sheet. Microchip's moves here have been a little bit more I don’t know it looks like opportunistic or aggressive you might characterize by pulling down the revolver to pay off part of the convert. I am wondering if you can walk us what the thinking was the company the courage to do that in this environment.
Ganesh Moorthy: Let me take that. So we begin the effort by some of our convert debt when the stock to hit about $60 like low $60 and that was down about a peak of $110. The amount of dilution we get from these converts when the stock goes from let's say $65 to $110 is so large because it has a hyper future where the stock competes at 1.5 times that it will be $1 increase in stock price and was just very, very dilutive.So when the stock price because of the recession went down from $110 into low $60, we decided not to waste that recession and to try to pushing up our convert, but to do so we needed the money and this year we took the money out of the line, we did not. We didn’t take any money out of the line of credit. We first wanted to raise the money in the public market through a debt but with extreme volatility the debt market is closed for a period of time and so we went to the action of getting a 364 day bridge. So we got $615 million of bridge at very, very low interest rates, same interest rate as the line of credit and with that we bought $615 million worth of face value convertible and by the time we executed those convertible stock had already been rebounded to about $70.70 where we average where we bought them and where the stock is now at $85.50 you could just imagine how much dilution we have saved that we would have incurred.So we think it was very, very opportunistic good move and we didn't stress the credit line to do that. We got a separate bridge, so it was a venue money separate bridge that we've prepared within a year.
William Stein: Got it. I didn't maybe I didn't appreciate the distinction, thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: I just would say I wish I was able to raise more money than I would have brought even more but it was a very, very difficult time. There were companies there was a run on the banks, people were drawing their credit line completely and banks were under lot of stress and that environment I was able to raise $615 million in new money something like miracle at that time.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Sir please go ahead.
Christopher Rolland: I guess first maybe talk about cycle times and lead times some of our data suggest that your leads are up a little bit. I think you did talk about the Philippine, Malaysia. Maybe just talk about lead times from that perspective. I know they're low historically, but talk about where you are there with any increases and then I guess balance that with inventory it looks like you're not increasing any inventory. So I guess you guys are super worried, but maybe talk about that lead times and the balance of inventory as well.
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh let me have you take lead time question.
Ganesh Moorthy: So lead time for most of our products from relatively are stable. Lead times in these factory that have been constrained by shelves in place have gone out and they've gone out by I would say on average about a couple of weeks and so whatever you are hearing or seeing is on certain product lines I think a little ones that go to Philippines or Malaysia where we've seen it. But for the most part lead times outside of that are remaining stable and we expect that lead times will catch back to normal by probably closer to the end of the quarter as we catch up stock will usually open and we're able to both ship normal but also do any catch-up shipments.
Christopher Rolland: Steve you're the big picture guy and you touched on this a bit already, but looking forward what do you think that the biggest risks are to your business here and if you have to start pulling some contingencies to lessen the blow, what are you thinking you can -- what's in your control from here that you plan on doing. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Well the biggest risk to the business is that COVID19 is not contained as we are talking about from state to state and you're internationally – nationally and internationally from Washington and other places as people go back to work here in the coming month, the question is do we see it way for COVID19 cases starting to go back up as people are willing to go back to work. I think as people go back to work, there will be all the precautions of NASH and cleaning and others. And hopefully, we will not have a second wave but it's tucking away requiring to go back to sheltering place and that would be the largest risk that we're seeing because that would have prove on the time spend during which the factories will be shut down, the demand would be low. People will be buying cars and other stuff. That I see as the biggest risk.Now in terms of what levers do we have, I think we've already implemented those levers that are while our business in March quarter was not even last stressed we sequentially grew but we implemented these measures to essentially finite categories six times and those are the levers that already have implemented and we'll just continue with those and look for even occurring more discretion and the expenses and see if that could go down further and any other discretion of the expense to go down further.Ganesh and I and others are willing to take a larger pick but usually it's a volume up to predict pick up that helps and I don’t think we can ask the word while incurring larger pick up, but you're also have policies to play with and capital and other things. But like I mentioned I think in an answer to an earlier question we try to model a scenario to try to see how much of revenue has to go down before we become cash flow negative or dividend comes through a questionable it's way too low and when I get there I think it's just -- our business is too strong today. The formation of the business is so good that we're not going to burn cash and the dividend is not at risk and I think we're in a pretty good place.
Christopher Rolland: Thank you and congrats on buying that convert bonds, nice price.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Just sort of geographical question back in March when we saw the team downshifted that time the downshift was driven by shortfall in China rights, it's a country starting to open back up but at a slower pace but you also did point out at that time that orders in business activity at that time in China was starting to pick back up and since then we've seen more cleanup of activity in China leasing auto production picking up this order, factories are starting to open up, consumer starting to spend. So have you seen follow through of that China improvement trend as maybe versus the world demand is weakening into the June quarter or are you also seeing degradation and deterioration in China orders and bookings as well?
Steve Sanghi: So I think depending on when you look at monthly or you look at it by quarter when you look at it by quarter China was very weak for the March quarter because Chinese New Year first of all was extended to two to three weeks from one week and then all these factories were closed. So the China business was horrible. if you really look at for the quarter but if you look at it on a monthly basis as the COVID19 situation got contained and people went back to work, China business almost seems like it's back to normal.However, the concern is that it may look like back to normal because it's really making up for some of the shortfall and all that it had and once that demand is met is a steady state demand in China back to normal or not. I think that needs to be answered in the month of May and June, but April China was very strong and late product margin in China was very strong as if it would be normal or even better.
Harlan Sur: Okay. I appreciate the insights there Steve and then just on the backend operation you talked about Malaysia, you talked about Philippines but you guys actually have a pretty large in Thailand they are locked down to the end of this month. So how is the team been able to manage quite nicely to the movement control in Thailand and is Thailand running at full run rate?
Steve Sanghi: Yeah so Thailand did not have any strong ordinance, let me have Ganesh comment on that. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: So the time of the lockdown are really a curfew at night from about 10 PM and 8 AM. It doesn't affect our shifts, our ability to operate our plans and so under the new logistic or other issues that we run into. So thankfully kind of the entire episode has been running full steam no issues.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ari Shusterman from…
Ari Shusterman: So I first wanted to talk about automotive. So in auto which products have shown the greatest strength and can you talk about traction you've been seeing in silicon carbide?
Steve Sanghi: Let me have Ganesh for that.
Ganesh Moorthy: So I think when you have such a large demand reduction in automotive there is no segment I can pull out and say this is strong and so automotive across the board when we look at our many different product lines, they are going to automatic drill down in this. Now to your question of silicon carbide it's early days, and silicon carbide predominantly a new technology that is aimed at electric cars from a high-volume standpoint. Electric cars as a percentage of the total automobiles produced are sold and it's 1% to 2% and so it's still a small percentage.We're making good inroads with our products to be new designs and new activity that are taking place. So it's really not a factor in any revenue that is taking place for automotive today, but we're making very good progress because the silicon carbide solution for Microchip are extremely robust and in an automotive environment which is very harsh, the voltage and temperature standpoint we're about as one of the most important factors that take into account for using silicon carbide products.
Ari Shusterman: And as a quick follow-up with regards to FPGA business, what are trends that you’ve been seeing in and how would you say your FPGA is compared to ionic Altera. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Go ahead Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: So our FPGA business continues to be reasonably strong. It had a nice growth as we showed during the March quarter results that we announced. Our FPGA also has a reasonably good exposure into defense and space applications. Those end markets are not as badly affected as some of the other end markets that we have and to be quite honest we don’t really see lot of it in some of the other names that frequently and what we run up into the market.We play predominantly into the mid range and missed the lower end of the FPGA market, we have some unique positioning relative to security, low power, robustness and in those areas, we do extremely well.
Operator: Yes, the next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley FBR. Sir, go ahead.
Craig Ellis: Team, thanks for all of the detailed information so far. Steve I wanted to go back to a couple comments that you made about how unique this environment is and the fact that we got multiple dynamic and capacity had to content with those and the question for you is given how dynamic things are, what's Microchip doing, what are you doing to kind of assess where we are as demand compresses overall and then potentially reaccelerates and orders in backlog or have you expanded the things that you look at see when we'll get the turn and you have a view on when turn whether it be June or September some of the time?
Steve Sanghi: Management team Ganesh and I and the other members of the management team really keep a very, very strong finger on the pulse of the business. We watch a very large number of indicators internal and external on a weekly basis and more often than that if needed on specific indicators. So through that large stack up for indicators and graphs that we constantly monitor, we have added a few to really further assess that situation frequently and some of the things we're looking at it much more frequently are things like dollars or push outs and cancellation number of coronavirus cases and various geographies where factories are and customer are.Whether they're peaking, they're stable, they're growing, they're coming down. We're also just watching a number of other indicators employment related, first-time unemployment claims and all that. So there is really a large amount of data that we're absorbing and this certainly will include the data we get from our own customers to salespeople regularly with monthly bookings and design wins and our customers, customers comments on whether the business is growing or falling, where would it go and what's happening. So there is so much more intelligence that goes into really before we continue and we're even more focused on getting all that intelligence today.
Craig Ellis: And that give me any sense for when we could be at the bottom?
Steve Sanghi: No, I think that is too early to really have that kind of confidence at the bottom. The numbers are so broad just have a guidance of minus two to minus 10 it's just so broad that we cannot yet say what September will bring. It will largely depend on whether as the people go back to work there is the coronavirus that kind of dies down or there is a second wave if coronavirus coming back and we're dealing with it with our factory shut down even in August and September. If that happens then the bottom isn’t here yet.
Craig Ellis: Certainly, if I could ask a follow-up just relating to some of the things that are happening inside of the business given how dynamic things are one, because it cause the team to think any differently will be the inventory that should be stocked to properly to pull customers and two given, Ganesh's characterization of what's wrong and squeezed does it cause the team to think any differently about where it's emphasizing incremental R&D on products and that kind of thing. Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi: So long-term target for inventory level is 115 to 120 and we finished the March quarter and 122. I don’t know you get any more precise than that. So inventory is really like that. So inventory is right exactly where we want the inventory to be I really tell you it got a little bit high earlier during the US China trade related and then we have been bringing it down. So March quarter inventory was nearly perfect and because of this coronavirus situation now, we didn't want inventory to substantially grow. So therefore we put our factories on reduced workload rotating time off or reduced hours of work or whatever.And to call it so that as the revenue in the June quarter is declining, we don't want the inventories to grow very substantially. So I think our inventories are in the right range and we're comfortable with it. In terms of R&D Ganesh will comment on that.
Ganesh Moorthy: So I think no one should take short term positive and negative that's the way in which we're investing from an R&D perspective and that's what we're seeing in this cycle at this point in time. R&D is really a longer-term view of where are the markets going, where are the opportunity and we're guided by the six megatrends that we have shared with you.We believe over the next 5 to 10 years growth is going to be available at a faster level or higher level in 5G data centers, autonomous driving, IOT, electric vehicle and artificial intelligence and machine learning and so the main product lines at Microchip are working on how can they create complete solutions total system solutions for these megatrends and what maybe strong today and maybe not so strong in six months or 12 month is how we do our R&D spend.
Operator: I am showing no further questions at this time.
Ganesh Moorthy: Okay. Thank you, operator and thanks all the investors and analyst who were on this call. The travel is really totally banned. So we'll be attending some of the conferences this quarter but they will all be virtual conferences. We'll do it out of our home. So we'll talk to some of you more at those conferences. So thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-02-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Microchip's third quarter fiscal 2020 financial results conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please begin.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2020 financial performance. And Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.We are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website.I want to remind investors that during the June quarter of 2018, we adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition standard which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy where revenue on such transactions were deferred until the product was sold by our distributors to an end customer.As discussed in previous earnings conference calls, we continue to track and measure our performance internally based on direct revenue plus distribution sell-through activity and each quarter we will provide a metric for this called end-market demand in our earnings release. Therefore, along with our GAAP and non-GAAP results based on distribution sell-in, we will also provide investors with our end-market demand based on distribution sell-out but will not provide a P&L based on end-market demand. End-market demand in the December 2019 quarter was $1.324 billion. End-market demand was about $36.1 million more than our GAAP revenue in the December 2019 quarter.I will now go through some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.Net sales in the December quarter were $1.287 billion, which was down 3.76% sequentially and near the high-end of our updated revenue guidance provided on January 6, 2020. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales and end-market demand by product line and geography on our website for your reference.On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.5%, operating expenses were at 26.4% and operating income was 35.1% and above the high-end of our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $340.8 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1 32, which was above the high-end of our last provided non-GAAP EPS guidance from December 3, 2019 of $1.30.On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 61% and include the impact of $5.7 million of share based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $654.3 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $248.7 million, special charges of $17.8 million, $10.9 million of acquisition related and other costs and share based compensation of $37.8 million. The GAAP net income was $311.1 million or $1.20 per diluted share. Our December quarter GAAP tax benefit was significantly positively impacted by the tax benefit related to the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights.The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6% in the December quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal 2020 to be about 6%, exclusive of any transition tax, any potential tax associated with the restructuring of the Microsemi operations into Microchip's global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as U.S. interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The future cash tax payments associated with the transition tax is expected to be about $245 million and will be paid over the next six years. We have posted a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website.Our inventory balance at December 31, 2019 was $708.8 million. We had 129 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, down two days from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were at 28 days compared to 30 days at the end of September. We have only had one quarter in the past 15 years, which was Q3 of fiscal year 2013, where our days of inventory at distribution have been lower than the current levels.The cash flow from operating activities was $395.5 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $402.3 million. We paid down $257 million of total debt in the December quarter and the net debt on the balance sheet was reduced by $254.2 million. Over the last six full quarters since we close the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $1.986 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business. We expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years.Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was $503.4 million and our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA was $2.125 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity -like in nature, was 4.58 at December 31, 2019. Our dividend payment in the December quarter was $87.7 million. Capital expenditures were $14.1 million in the December 2019 quarter. We expect between $20 million and $25 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to be between $76 million and $81 million.We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect these capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the outsourced Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $41.4 million.I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you Eric and good afternoon everyone. Before I get started, I would like to remind you that the product line comparisons I will be sharing with you today are based on end-market demand, which is how Microchip measures this performance internally.Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was sequentially down 1.1% as compared to the September quarter. We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers including next-generation Bluetooth 5.0 dual-mode audio solutions, production ready open source tools for managing our Adapttec smart storage offerings and industry support for development of the Open Compute Project's Accelerator Infrastructure through our PCIe switches. Microcontrollers represented 53.6% of our end-market demand in the December quarter.Moving to analog. Our analog business was sequentially down 3.6% as compared to the September quarter. During the quarter, we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products including the IEEE 802.3bt-2018-compliant Power over Ethernet injectors and midspans that enable up to 90 watts of power without changing switches or cabling. Analog represented 28.1% of our end-market demand in the December quarter.Our FPGA business was sequentially flat as compared to the September quarter. During the quarter, we introduced the radiation tolerant PolarFire FPGA for space and other high reliability applications, as well as the early access program for the PolarFire system-on-chip FPGA, offering the world's first hardened real-time, Linux capable, RISC-V-based microprocessor subsystem. Design wins for the PolarFire family continue to grow strongly and we remain optimistic about the prospects for this product family. FPGA represented 6.9% of our end-market demand in the December quarter.Our licensing, memory and other product line, which we refer to as LMO, was sequentially down 0.7% as compared to the September quarter. During the quarter, we delivered a new family of electrically erasable RAM products, providing cost-effective alternatives to nonvolatile RAM solutions at a number of memory densities. LMO represented 11.3% of our end-market demand in the December quarter.An update regarding Coronavirus and what we are seeing. First, all our employees are safe and that remains our highest priority. We implemented travel bans in and out of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan two weeks ago. We also implemented self-quarantine requirements for anyone who may have traveled to these countries. Mandatory medical assessment and clearance for anyone who may have symptoms, a screening questionnaire for all external visitors to any Microchip facility and common sense preventive sanitizing steps on a continuous basis in all our facilities worldwide.As you well know, most provinces in China have extended the Chinese New Year holidays till February 9. Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, has extended the holidays till February 13. Our manufacturing footprint in China is small and we expect little impact to our operations from this extension. Also at this time, we do not anticipate any significant supply chain issues for materials sourced from China.Some of our customers could be affected by the extended Chinese New Year holidays. It is too early to determine what impact there may be as most are not yet back from the extended holidays. Because Chinese New Year this year was early in the quarter, there is more time for our customers to catch up lost production within the quarter. We also believe there is slack in manufacturing capacity, which can be of help while recovering lost production.These outbreaks are unpredictable and there may yet be other twists and turns to come in the days ahead. We continue to process the news daily as well as monitor information from the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. We will adopt our response as needed and focus on the things that we can control.Finally, over the last few months, we started share six megatrends that we believe provide significant growth opportunities for Microchip over the next five to 10 years and I would like to summarize them. First, the 5G infrastructure rollout which is just getting started and has a decade ahead of it. Each prior generation of wireless infrastructure deployment 2G, 3G and 4G lasted for about 10 years.The Internet of things comprised of smart, connected and secure end nodes is picking up steam, especially for industrial IoT where there are compelling business models for customers to make money, save money and mitigate risk.Third, for data center. The data center demand to store and process data is exploding as data is created at a hyper exponential rate. To put this in perspective, estimates are that 90% of world's data was created in just the last two years and that trend continues unabated.Fourth, electric and hybrid vehicles are riding a wave of consumer and regulatory forces which are driving substantial investment in technology and capacity. Fifth is the advanced driver assist which is already a growth application and its proliferation to more car models and its natural progression to increasing levels of autonomous driving. Sixth is finally the artificial intelligence and machine learning which we see as another explosive growth area, not only in the cloud, but even more so at the edge.These megatrends cut across the diverse end-markets we serve and guide our product development priorities. We believe these megatrends in conjunction with our total system solutions go-to-market approach will provide key opportunities for organic growth in the coming years.With that, let me pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you Ganesh and good afternoon everyone. Today I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2020. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020.Our December quarter was an interesting one in which we revised the midpoint of our guidance upwards twice, once on December 3, 2019 prior to the Credit Suisse conference and second on January 6, 2020 prior to JPMorgan conference. Our final December quarter GAAP net sales were on the high-end of our latest guidance and came in at $1.287 billion, down 3.76% sequentially. Our end-market demand based on sell-through was $36 million higher than GAAP sales which we believe shows that the channel was continuing to manage their working capital conservatively by reducing inventory due to uncertainty. December was the seventh consecutive quarter where our sell-through revenue was higher than our sell-in revenue.Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin of 61.5% was just above the high-end of our guidance. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 35.1% was also just above the high-end of our guidance. Our consolidated non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.32, which was also above the high-end of our revised guidance. So overall, December quarter turned out to be a lot better than originally guided.On non-GAAP basis, this was also our 117th consecutive profitable quarter. In the December quarter, we paid down $257 million of our debt. Our total debt payment since the end of June 2018 has been about $2 billion. The pace of debt payments has been strong despite the weak and uncertain business conditions underlining the strong cash generation characteristics of our business as well as our active efforts to continue to squeeze working capital efficiencies.Now before I provide you guidance for the March quarter, let me comment on some of the inflection points that we saw during the December quarter. Our December quarter bookings were up double digit percentage over the September quarter bookings that resulted in our starting backlog for March quarter to be up double digit percentage over the starting backlog for the December quarter. Our starting backlog was up in each of the geographies of North America, Europe and Asia. From an end market perspective, we saw strength in data centers and start of a recovery in industrial and automotive.Continuing on the inflection points, the book-to-bill ratio for December quarter was well above one after multiple quarters of book-to-bill being below one. Our distributor inventory at the end of September was already at low level and lowest in 15 years except one quarter in fiscal year 2013. In December quarter, the distribution inventory went even lower. During December quarter, we saw increased level of customer requested pull-ins, many of it is required factory expedites. Seeing these multiple signs of inflection point, we call the December quarter to be a bottom for Microchip for this cycle barring any negative developments on the U.S.-China trade front or the impact of Coronavirus.Now I turn to guidance for March quarter. The backlog for March quarter that started out quite strong continued to fill in during the month of January. Taking all these factors into consideration and after rolling up revenue expectations from sales regions as well as business units, we expect GAAP net sales based on sell-in revenue recognition for our products to be up between 2% to 9% sequentially in the March 2020 quarter. The midpoint of our guidance for the March 2020 quarter reflects what we believe our business can deliver assuming no extraordinary events. However, the wider than normal guidance range is to help account for the uncertainty associated with the evolving Coronavirus situation. We are still in the early days of how this situation is playing out. We have no way to model how the rest of the quarter will play out for the Coronavirus situation and what the consequent business impact may be. But we believe that our guidance range incorporates our best judgment for the possible scenarios.Regarding CapEx, we expect to finish fiscal year 2020 with a CapEx of between $76 million and $81 million, a significant reduction from fiscal year 2019 CapEx of $229 million. This is consistent with what we have said before that our CapEx is divided between growth capital, maintenance capital and new products and technology capital. In a fiscal year like 2020 in which our net sales declined, the growth capital which is the largest portion of the CapEx declines to virtually nothing and therefore the total CapEx declined significantly.For March quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61.5% and 61.9% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 25% and 26.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 35.3% and 36.9% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.35 per share to $1.51 per share.Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis except for net sales which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call.With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach: Yes. Thank you. Steve, just a question on the expedited activity. Can you just maybe put that into context with currently where your lead times are and things you are looking to do to maybe kind of address that as business improves?
Steve Sanghi: So during this down cycle, we built a substantial amount of inventory that is held in the die bank. So when an order comes in, it's really taking the die from the die bank and processing it through which can be anywhere to as low three weeks to as much as six, seven weeks depending on where it has to go, inside or outside or what difficult package or assembly test it might be.What we are finding is that customers stationed a fair amount of backlog just outside the quarter and then when they need the product they expedite into the quarter. This way, they kind of have both choices. They could not take it in the quarter and leave it out or push it out further or if they need it, ask us to pull it in. We have been seeing the strange phenomenon now not only this quarter, we have been seeing it for some time but it really became even more accentuated. So there is a fair amount of backlog sitting outside the quarter in April and customers are expediting it into the quarter.Does that answer your question?
Craig Hettenbach: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I am curious, what are you expecting your distributors to do in the March quarter? I think you are giving a net sales outlook. So any color on sell-in and sell-out trends would be helpful. And in general, what are they saying to you? Why are they taking down Microchip inventory to such low levels because it's such an outlier and we don't hear of any of your other peers their inventories being taken down to be similarly low levels?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I don't really know if, as we speak, distributors are taking down inventory further, but they have in the last is seven quarters or so through December. We don't really have a guidance for the March quarter on sell-through. We can't really provide both ends of the guidance. It's just too much work. So we are providing the sell-in guidance that we have given you.And in the December quarter when we provided the guidance, we expected that distributors will reverse the trend and will start to build a sound inventory towards normalization. It did not happen in December. We are expecting it would happen again in March, but there is no guarantee. Distributors will do what they will do.I think part of the reason is, for 30 years, our culture at Microchip, in our business unit, sales organization, up and down to the change with the distribution, our conversations with the distributors are winning designs, creating a large funnel and pulling those designs to production and creating sales out. That is how we pay our sales people. That's how we pay our business unit. That's how all the bonuses are structured. And we don't really have a whole lot of conversations regarding what we give into the distribution.That has always been less important to us because we manage our business based on sell-through. So distributors take the inventory what they want to run their business and based on getting returns for their business. In contrast, I think we see many of our peers and competitors are more focus on sell-in revenue recognition where they may make deals to put more product into distribution and arresting the fall of the inventory that way.
Ganesh Moorthy: I would add one more thing. We always had low lead times on our products. And I think that gives distributors an opportunity to run the inventory to whatever the lowest level they think they can get away with while continue to focus on sell-through. So short lead times give them the opportunity to carry less inventory as well.
Steve Sanghi: I would also add that some time we charge expedite charges for expediting the product. So sometime expedited charges require us to spend weekends, pay over time or pay expedite for shipping, going through hand carry products and all sorts of charge incurred and we often pass those to the customers. It doesn't move the needle in terms of revenue but if somebody wants to expedite the parts, it's not always free.
Vivek Arya: But you are not assuming any restocking benefit? Any major restocking benefit in March?
Steve Sanghi: We have no way to model it.
Vivek Arya: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.
Gary Mobley: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about your relative performance in the microcontroller segment. It looks like for the full calendar year 2019, you outperformed the microcontroller market in terms of sales growth if you believe in the SIA sales metrics. But in the second half of the year, it looks like and particularly in the fourth calendar quarter, it looks like you might have underperformed the market. To what should we attribute that to? Is it just sort of a short term disruption or anything to look into there long term?
Steve Sanghi: I am not sure what data it is you are referring to. So we were sequentially down 1.1% on microcontrollers, September to December. If you look at the year-over-year numbers, we are on microcontroller were down about 5%, 5.5%, somewhere in that neighborhood. The story is not written. We don't see any annualized numbers that are out yet. Maybe SIA has some early numbers. We will get that by March, April and we will at the next conference call have the typical Gartner 2019 numbers. There is nothing in our business that has any indication that something was better in the first half and got worse in the second half.
Ganesh Moorthy: I think if you look at the quarter result sequentially and compare it to a very large competitor, I think we substantially outgrew them.
Steve Sanghi: So these are year-over-year.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes.
Gary Mobley: Understood. All right. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. A question with regard to gross margins and assuming we just have started recovery, we would hope to see some gross margin improvement as a result. Perhaps you could answer it in terms of production utilization levels with some of the better order rates? Has that caused you to change any production levels? And then from a cost standpoint as we go forward, I think you still have some integration benefits still to come. Could you help to quantify those and when they kick in and how that helps leverage if indeed we are in a recovery?
Eric Bjornholt: Sure. This is Eric. So in the December quarter, we incurred about a $16 million factory under utilization charge that was reflected in our cost of sales. That was up about $7 million quarter-on-quarter. We expect that charge to be lower in the March quarter. Particularly in our backend assembly and test operations, we are running the factories higher.Steve talked about it in an earlier response that our die bank is pretty healthy. But backend operations, we have been training finished goods and looking to run the factories harder this quarter, which should help on the gross margin and the guidance that we are given. So that's a piece of it. We continue to run our factories as efficiently as we can. We are continuing to invest to bring some of the outsourced assembly and test in-house at a moderate rate and all those things are going to benefit gross margin long term and lead us to our long term guidance, which is to get to about 63% non-GAAP gross margins as a long term model versus the 61.7% we are guiding to at the midpoint of guidance for the current quarter.
Operator: All right. Thank you. Our next question will come from William Stein with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
William Stein: Great. Similar topic, only not just gross, on operating as well. Maybe Eric, you can take a step back and frame up relative to where you are now and contemplating your longer term goals, what's the path to getting there? Is it just a modest amount of revenue recovery? Is mix part of the equation? Is there still restructuring for Microsemi? I know you are still bringing capacity in-house. It seems to us that it seems really likely that you will be able to exceed these long term targets given the revenue level that you are achieving today relative to what the next peak could be, for example? Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So you know, I think I have kind of touched on gross margin so far. And we have been told by others that they think that's a conservative forecast. But we are not going to update that model until we get to the target. And on OpEx, we are guiding the current quarter to be between 25% and 26.2% of sales and our long term model is 22.5%. I would say, we have been pretty conservative in how we have been managing the business during this current cycle.And with that, we need to make sure that we are making the appropriate investment, whether it's in R&D, support functions, technical sales, outreach to the customers to make sure we drive the long term health of the business. And some of our variable compensation programs too will kick back in as revenue grows. So we have confidence in the long term model which is just above 40% operating margins.And we got a ways to go when we are guiding the current quarter at the midpoint of guidance to about 36.1%. So I would say, be patient. We do need revenue growth to get there. But I think we are well positioned with the investments that we have made to add to drive to higher levels than what we are seeing today.
William Stein: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Financial Group.
Ambrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you very much. Steve, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the source of strength in bookings? Whether end-markets or geos? I believe last earnings call, you had indicated that China was stronger in terms of geo. So any update on that front would be helpful. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: So I think from an end-market perspective, we said that data center has been strong all along and we are seeing startup of a recovery in the industrial market and the automotive market. The communication market remains weak and the appliance market remains weak. And aerospace and defense is kind of always lumpy and it's hard to call.From a geographical perspective, yes, we saw strength in the China market last quarter. But you would see the weakness in China market this quarter, driven by the Lunar New Year and nobody knows what's going to happen with the Coronavirus. So this quarter, you would see stronger U.S. and Europe and weaker China.
Ambrish Srivastava: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham & Company.
Raji Gill: Yes. Thank you. If we think about the seasonality in the business now that we have some time [indiscernible], how do we think about it coming out of the bottom of the cycle and kind of perhaps entering into mid cycle recovery, excluding the impact of Coronavirus? I am just trying to get a sense of the seasonality [indiscernible] post the bottom of the cycle. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: I think, Raji, seasonality is still hard to measure where all the acquisitions that we have completed. The events that have happened in the last couple of years, all the trade tensions situation, general economic conditions and now the Coronavirus, prior to that we had a significant inventory correction event on especially the Microsemi inventory. We really haven't finished enough quarters in a healthy business environment to peg a seasonality. So I would think it still remains difficult.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.
Craig Ellis: Yes. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the good execution. I had wanted to go back to some of the comments around the performance on debt production, which over the last six quarters at almost $2 billion is very strong. The question is, perhaps both you Eric and you Steve, is as you look ahead and given the trajectory you are on, it seems like you could be at a 3X net debt to EBITDA level in as soon as four quarters or so. So how do you think about deploying the cash to create value for shareholders when you get to that level? Would a vast majority of available cash will go to debt pay down? Or would you start looking at other things? And what would the priorities be at that point? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Let me take that and Eric can add to it. First of all, I don't think I have looked at a model which will take the leverage down to 3X in four quarters. That seems awfully aggressive although I don't know what assumption you are making in the revenue growth of the recovery. It will largely depend on that. But basically, yes, we need to bring the debt leverage below a three handle, kind of have it to somewhere in the high twos.Once we get there, then we will still be generating somewhere of the order of well over $1 billion of free cash per quarter and we need to figure out what we do. I mean we haven't been in that situation in quite a long time. You have obvious choices. You could pay down more debt and bring leverage down further. But more preferably, you could increase the dividend. You can start a buyback program and that all assuming that there is not a further M&A possibility.We have said before that we think by the time we come up for air, majority of the companies or smaller company that we would like to buy, probably would have been bought and there isn't as much more opportunity there. But there could be one more possibly. But secondly, we think that the remaining assets are very expensive. There is large amount of M&A bid on them already because every small company is really on sale and we don't really pay that kind of multiple that we have seen paid in the recent deals.Cyprus as well as some other deals, those multiples were way, way too high for our case. If we can not find a reasonable other acquisition, then our focus will switch to other uses of cash, including higher dividend, more stock buyback and possibly some more debt pay down.
Eric Bjornholt: I think what I am going to add to that is just kind of a short term view here is, because I know we will get this question a lot is, what do we expect for debt pay down in the current quarter, the March quarter. And really, we expect that to be somewhere between $225 million and $250 million. Last quarter, it was $257 million but our starting accounts receivable balance was lower just because revenue was down last quarter.So really to get some tailwinds behind us, from a revenue perspective, as the topline grows I think EBITDA will start growing nicely and that's going to help with the leverage metrics coming down. But it kind of depends on what the environment is going to be over the course of the next year. If we were able to get to that, three times number that you mentioned, I think we would need pretty good revenue growth.
Craig Ellis: Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi.
Chris Danely: Hi. Thanks Steve, Steve, you mentioned that some customers were expediting orders out of the June quarter into this quarter. So do you think that the June quarter could be at risk of a little bit of a disappointment like we are robbing from the June quarter to pay the March quarter? And then further to that, you talked a little about lead times. Do you think that there is risk of extended lead times if this expediting continues?
Steve Sanghi: The lead times are not at risk short term because we have a fair amount of die inventory and there is a fair amount of capacity slack in the system since the revenues are down year-over-year. The backlog bottomed out some time ago and the total extended backlog is really growing nicely. So when people are taking backlog from June quarter moving into March quarter, that's not putting June quarter at risk. There is higher and higher backlog. The overall backlog is growing. Book-to-bill was strongly positive. So it put a very large amount of total backlog on the system.
Ganesh Moorthy: Chris, we had expedites in the December quarter where people have placed backlog in the March quarter and pulled it in. You are seeing a stronger March quarter despite that. So as you go into and upward trend in the business, it is not unnatural. We have see it in other cycles where customers start to see their business recovering and wanting to have products sooner than they had originally planned for.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. And in addition to those orders that are being pulled in by customers requesting them into the current quarter, we are also receiving orders that are just within our normal published lead times. And that can create some expedite activity also.
Ganesh Moorthy: Often with short lead times, yes.
Steve Sanghi: And Chris, this phenomenon is not a new one. We have seen it before in prior cycles and we have been seeing it in this cycle. I kind of call it, have your cake and eat it too. So customers will place an order where they are still in the cancellation or push-out window and if they don't want it or if their business is not strong, they can push it out or leave it out. But if their business is stronger and they need it, then they ask us to expedite it. Kind of have their cake and eat it too. It's not a new phenomenon. But we are seeing it quite accentuated right now and that's why I called it out.
Chris Danely: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.
Harsh Kumar: Yes. Hi Steve. I was curious, with the sudden pickup in China, are you aware of any areas of shortages not just in your business, but in the industry overall?
Steve Sanghi: I am not seeing any shortages. I mean, China right now is shut down. So you really wouldn't get any data. They were shut down for the Chinese New Year. They are just about coming back. But most provinces have extended it till February 9. But prior to going for the Chinese New Year, no, we were not experiencing any shortages.
Harsh Kumar: Fair enough. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International Group.
Christopher Rolland: Thanks for the question. Eric, perhaps asked another way, if you could talk about Atmel and Microsemi, bringing them in-house, remind us where we are on front-end and back-end? And then also the gross margin benefits that you would get there? Also, how are you able to do this in such a small CapEx envelope as well? Thanks.
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So there is a couple pieces to that. So we did tighten our investment criteria in terms of making those capital investments over the course of the last year when business was difficult. And so we shortened the window, the payback window, from a cash flow perspective, from two years down to a year. And we really haven't changed that at this point in time. So that's one of the reason the spend has been lower. And this is very detailed work. So it's package-by-package, part-by-part and none of these investments are needle movers but in aggregate they do help gross margins slowly over time. So I think that's responsive to your question, unless these guys have anything else they want to add.
Steve Sanghi: You can give them the percentage we have inside and outside for fab, assembly and tests.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. So fab is 39% internal, assembly is 45% and test is 54%.
Christopher Rolland: That's useful. Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: And we would expect those assembly and test percentages to increase over time as we gradually make these investments.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong start to 2020. I know lead times are still pretty short but given the strong bookings trends coming off of the depressed September quarter, strong bookings thus far here in the March quarter and maybe some backlog build for June, ex-ing out the potential issues for Coronavirus, but do you think you are setting up, given the backlog that are you seeing, at least for a seasonal June quarter, which is typically one of your seasonally strongest quarters?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we are not giving guidance or commenting on the June quarter, especially in the light of significant uncertainty because of the Coronavirus. Remove those uncertainties and let's say there is no impact and business comes back and the virus is contained rapidly and all that, then your assessment for the June quarter would be correct.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. And I think I would just add that we are very well-positioned from a capacity perspective to be able to respond quickly to upside if that develops.
Harlan Sur: Got it. And then I guess, on that note, back in early January when you did your update, it didn't sound like you were going to be increasing front-end utilizations near-term just because you guys have pretty substantial die banks. But let's say as the March quarter progress and the backlog is indicating a potential for normal seasonal growth for June and September, I assume the team would start to ramp capacity utilization, say, in the back half of this quarter. Is that kind of the right way to think about the potential timing of utilizations going up?
Steve Sanghi: So this is Steve. Let me take that. I think, let's start from the back-end first and we will come to the front-end. The back-end utilization is going up as we speak. And as we ramp, it will continue to go up because we depleted the finished goods. And when the orders are strong, we have got to take the die bank and finish them. So that will continue to have a positive effect on gross margin pretty much starting now.When you look at the front-end, the front-end still has a fair amount of die bank but there also you have got to separate it on the production we do inside versus the production we buy from outside. The inventory on the products we buy from outside was depleted to a lower level and there we are increasing the buy know as we speak. But there is not a utilization impact of that, because that was being done outside.What we were going inside, that's what we had the substantial die bank and I think it will at least take it few more quarters before we have to start increasing the production in our fabs.
Harlan Sur: Got it. Okay. But then the lower, the lower underutilization charges here in the March quarter is simply because you are filling out your packaging and test assembly utilizations are going up, right. Is that the primary driver for the lower underutilization charges?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. Well, you know, there is always lots of moving parts, mix and on that. But yes, there is a new phenomenon where even in the December quarter, we were depleting finished goods. We were a quarter back-end utilization was lower than the September quarter and the March quarter will be up significantly from the December quarter.I wanted to add one more comment on the question you asked regarding the June quarter seasonality, how it would be in and the comment was made that June quarter will at least be seasonal. I would say, I hope that one of these quarter, current quarter as well as June quarter and September quarter are well above seasonal because the inventory is at so low and if I take any cues from any prior recoveries whether it was from SaaS or it was the recovery from 2009 cycle or any other cycle recovery, usually you have got two or three quarters of well above seasonal recovery that takes the business back to the old heights and then goes from there. So I like to think that any kind of forecast here becomes very conservative.
Harlan Sur: Yes. That's a fair point, Steve. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Securities.
Vijay Rakesh: I was wondering, as you look at your business, I was wondering if we can get some color by markets, end-markets, automotive, industrial? How you see that playing out the rest of the year? Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: So as Steve mentioned, we are starting to see automotive and industrial picking up from the bottom that they were at. They had pretty bad years in 2019. And our expectation is that, barring any outside events as we go through 2020, both those end-markets should see continued improvement.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And on the industrial and other end-markets, do you see a similar trend in the back half? Or do you see stronger first half year?
Ganesh Moorthy: So my comment was for both automotive and industrial. We have talked about data center. It was strong. It will remain strong. We don't see anything that suggests that's different. There maybe some communication market changes that are driven by what happens with Coronavirus. We don't know. But there is a large 5G cycle, investment cycle that's starting. And then as far as a defense and aerospace tend be pretty steady in how it goes. It remains steady with where it's at. And then the consumer cycle, we have yet to see if we will see some benefit. It needs further trade resolution for it to see any significant benefits but nothing new to report on that on the consumer end of the market.
Vijay Rakesh: All right. Great. Thanks.
Operator: All right. Thank you. Our last question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse Group.
John Pitzer: Yes. Guys, thanks for letting me get in. I have been jumping around calls. So I apologize if this is a repeat. But Steve, if you kind of look at the operating model for the business, historically you guys have always make good progress and then kind of taken a step back as you made acquisitions to then kind of move forward again. I am just kind of curious if we go to an extended period where you are not sort of in the acquisition game, how should we be thinking about operating margin targets and incremental gross and OP margins for the business over time?
Steve Sanghi: So John, you are very correct that we make substantial progress in gross and operating margin after an acquisition and then when we do another acquisition, most times we are not buying businesses that are over 60% gross margin and 40% operating margins. So our overall company margin, gross and operating, drop and then we work back up a few steps only to take a fall again when we buy next acquisition.Now if you make the assumption that for an extended period of time, we were to not do another acquisition then first thing that would happen is that we will reach our operating model. So our operating model, to remind everyone, is 63% gross margin and 22.5% percent operating expenses leading to a 40.5%, operating profit. So two ends of it.First, the gross margin. We are guiding 61.7% gross margin this quarter. So it's 130 basis points away. If you just take the underutilization charge of $16 million that pretty much get you there almost. The second issue is the operating expense. So operating expense basically we are guiding 25% to 26.2% and there is a huge leverage there with the revenue increase. The current revenue is, I think what, a couple of hundred million dollar behind the past record?
Eric Bjornholt: That's right.
Steve Sanghi: And a very round number. So once you gain that, you have a significant leverage where the operating expense comes down. Some leverage still remains in integration of Microsemi with all these go-lives and all that are happening which will take another nine months. But once we get all that done, then you have achieved gross margin as well as the operating expense and you have reached the model. Now if your question is, where dies the model go? Do we continue to go higher in gross margin and continue go higher in operating margin? For that, get in line and we will about it when we get there.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then just secondly, on Microsemi. It was an acquisition you kind of made as the industry was going into a correction. And you are talking about a little bit about kind of the expense leverage there. I am just kind of curious from a revenue leverage. I mean one of the things you guys have always done well, as you bought these assets, is going and kind of apply a better pricing discipline to the business. Is there still more to go with the Microsemi acquisition? Or has that mostly played out?
Ganesh Moorthy: First of all, I don't think we had the same pricing discipline issues in Microsemi as we did at Atmel. Microsemi, just to remind you, was gross margins that were right around 60% when we did the acquisition. The product lines at Microsemi are extremely sticky products and many of them have very long life cycles. And to that extent, those margins will stay high, the product line revenue will stay high.Now we have, in the time we have owned Microsemi, started to work on, so how are we going to take advantage of Microsemi's position in the end-markets they were strong in, data center, communications and aerospace and defense to be able to sell more complete portfolio. And that work is well underway. And reverse, how can we take Microsemi products into the end-market that Microchip was strong in prior to the acquisition, automotive, industrial and home appliances. And that work is going in.Now we have a six, seven quarter window where the environment has been weak and as we emerged from a weak environment and we go into a more normal environment, all the hard work that has been done will begin to play itself out. And so I think there are revenue synergies yet to come but in part, it's work to be done and lot of that is underway and has been for some time but a lot of it has to come as the environment strengthens.
Steve Sanghi: And John, I think if you study some of the past cycles, I know you and other analysts are very good at studying the past cycles, what really happens is nobody believes the depth of the downturn. And the estimates will always stay high and they get cut multiple times. In this cycle, the estimates really have been cut four times, not only for Microchip but for the industry and various other players. It could be more than four times.And then when the reverse happens, the estimates always go higher, beat and raise, beat and raise, beat and raise, for many quarters. I have seen this in prior cycles because nobody has the confidence to guess the revenue or guide the revenue to be higher than seasonal. And it continues for many quarters in the other direction. That's what I am hoping for but not guiding to.
Operator: All right. Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions in the queue. So I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Sanghi for any closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Well, we want to thank everyone for attending this call and we are going to about three different conferences, I think, this quarter. So we will see some of you at those conferences. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference and you may now disconnect. Please enjoy the rest of your evening.

===== 2020 Q2  (2019-11-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip's Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Microchip’s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2020 financial performance. And Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the ongoing integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website.I want to remind investors that during the June quarter of 2018, we adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition standard which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy where revenue on such transactions was deferred until the product was sold by our distributor to an end customer.As discussed in previous earnings conference calls, we continue to track and measure our performance internally based on direct revenue plus distribution sell-through activity and each quarter we'll provide a metric for this called end-market demand in our earnings release. Therefore along with our GAAP and non-GAAP results based on distribution sell-in, we will also provide investors with our end-market demand based on distribution sell-out but will not provide a P&L based on end-market demand.End-market demand in the September 2019 quarter was $1.346 billion. End-market demand was about $8.6 million more than our GAAP revenue in the quarter. I will now go through some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.Net sales in the September quarter were $1.338 billion, which was down 1.15% sequentially and modestly below the midpoint of our guidance of $1.349 billion. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales and end-market demand by product line and geography on our website for your reference.On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were near all-time highs at 62.24%, operating expenses were at 25.56% and operating income was 36.7%. Non-GAAP net income was 365.7 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1 43, which was in line with the midpoint of our guidance.On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.9% and included the impact of 5.2 million of share based compensation. Total operating expenses were 643.9 million and include acquisition and tangible amortization of 248.2 million, special charges of 3.6 million, 10.1 million of acquisition related and other costs, and share based compensation of 40.1 million. The GAAP net income was 108.9 million or $0.43 per diluted share.Our September quarter, GAAP tax benefits included 12.7 million of net discrete income tax benefits related to tax reserve releases, due to statute of limitations expiring, partially offset by a foreign tax assessment. The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6.5% in the September quarter and was negatively impacted by foreign tax assessment that Microchip will pay in fiscal year 2020, but defendant’s position and seek a refund of these taxes in the future. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '20 to be between 6% and 7%. Exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global tax structure, and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits, as well as U.S. interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The future cash tax payments associated with the transition tax is expected to be about 236 million and will be paid over the next six years. We have posted the schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website.Our inventory balance at September 30, 2019 was 734.2 million. We had 131 days of inventory at the end of the September quarter, down one day from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter were at 30 days compared to 32 days at the end of June. We have only had one quarter in the past 15 years, which was Q3 of fiscal year 2013, our days of inventory at distribution have been lower than the current levels.The cash flow from operating activities was 396 million in the September quarter. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was 405.1 million. We paid down 315.5 million of total debt in the September quarter, and the net debt on the balance sheet was reduced by 283.5 million. Over the last full five quarters, since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down 1.729 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt.We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business. We expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the September quarter was 540.2 million, and our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA was 2.178 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA excluding our very long dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and as more equity like in nature was 4.59 at September 30 2019. Our dividend payment in the September quarter was 87.3 million.Capital expenditures were 17.7 million in the September quarter. We expect between 20 million and 25 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to be between $90 million and $100 million, a $25 million reduction from the forecast we provided last quarter.We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities of our new products and technologies and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect these capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the outsourced Actel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was 39.5 million.I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter and provide an update on some of our ongoing Microsemi integration activities. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric. And good afternoon, everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to remind you that the product line comparisons I will be sharing with you today are based on end-market demand, which is how Microchip measured its performance internally. Also, as I go through the product line reports, they will reflect continued broad macro weakness in the markets we serve. This broad weakness was further accentuated in the month of September.Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was sequentially down 1.3%, as compared to the June quarter. We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers, including the industry's first commercially available serial memory solid-state drive controller, which won the Best-of-Show award in the 2019 Flash Memory Summit, as well as two different USB Type-C Power Delivery controllers, which enabled fast device charging and simplifies implementation of this functionality. Microcontrollers represented 53.3% of our end-market demand in the September quarter.Now moving to analog. Our analog business are sequentially up 0.2% as compared to the June quarter. During the quarter, we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products, including the introduction of the Trust Platform for CryptoAuthenticaion, the industry's first pre-provision solution providing secure key storage for small and large volumes. Analog represented 28.7% of our end-market demand in the September quarter,Our FPGA business was sequentially down 8.9%, as compared to the June quarter. As we have mentioned in prior conference calls, the FPGA business does have some lumpiness, because of a significant exposure to space, aviation and defense markets where procurement timing can be a function of programs and they're shifting priorities, schedules and budgets.During the quarter, we announced our Smart Embedded Vision initiative, providing for designing intelligent machine vision systems with our low power PolarFire FPGAs. Design wins for the PolarFire family continue to grow strongly. And we remain optimistic about the prospects for this product family. FPGA represented 6.8% of our end-market demand in the September quarter.Our licensing memory and other product line which we refer to as LMO was sequentially up 10.5% in the September quarter, as compared to the June quarter. Strength in our licensing business, as well as our timing systems business outpaced the broader macro weakness we experienced. LMO represented 11.2% of our end-market demand in the September quarter.In September, we completed the acquisition of two small early stage private companies. The first acquisition enables low power embedded computing solutions for machine learning inference, and smart embedded vision applications for our FPGA product families. This acquisition also adds domain knowledge depth in the areas of machine learning algorithms and vector processing.The second acquisition provides digital gate driver solutions for wide bandgap MOSFET and IGBT Technologies. The acquisition complements our silicon carbide discrete and modular power conversion offerings, and enables us to provide more comprehensive total system solutions.These two acquisitions were very small and more akin to acquiring intellectual property along with domain experts to help us accelerate our business agenda in specific laser focused areas. The combined cash outflow was less than $6 million and hence not material to the rate at which we're paying down our debt.Finally, a quick update about the ongoing Microsemi integration. We continue to plow forward with the business systems and operations integrations. On the business systems front, we went live with a few more systems on November 1. And as I mentioned on prior conference calls, this is a tedious and time consuming effort and we estimate that we're about 50% of the way to completion and have about another year of work ahead of us. We are pleased with the synergies we have achieved since we close the transaction, despite the week of macro environment, and we expect continued synergy gains for many quarters to come.Let me now pass it to Steve for his comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2020. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2020.Our September quarter GAAP net says based on selling revenue recognition was $1.338 billion, up 1.15% sequentially versus a guidance of flat to a 4%. So we missed the GAAP sales guidance slightly at the midpoint. Our end-market demand based on sell through was $8.6 million higher than GAAP sales, which we believe shows that the channel is continuing to manage the working capital conservatively by reducing inventory, due to uncertainty.Recall that we call the bottom of the cycle back in February of 2019, contingent on resolution of the U.S. China trade dispute. This trade settlement did not happen and remains unresolved. Since then, our end-market demand has been flat at 1.34 billion, 1.35 billion and 1.346 billion for March, June and September quarters respectively, due to multitude of headwinds from trade tensions, and resulting impact on automotive industrial and consumer appliance end-markets.Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin of 62.24% was just above the high end of our guidance and was near a record high. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 36.7% was also higher than the midpoint of our guidance of 36.2%. The integration of Microsemi continues to proceed very nicely. Since the closing of the acquisition, we are continuing to see strong synergies and improvements in growth and operating margins for Microsemi products. Our consolidated non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.43 right at the midpoint of our guidance. On non-GAAP basis, this was also our 116 consecutive profitable quarter.In the September quarter, we paid down $315.5 million of our debt. Our total debt payments since the end of June 2018 has been $1.73 billion. The pace of debt payments has been strong, despite the weekend uncertain business conditions as we continue to squeeze working capital.Now before I provide you guidance for the December quarter, let me comment on geographical and end-market sales. While the uncertainty begins with U.S. China trade friction, the uncertainty has become global. The week business conditions can be seen in all geographies. Our Americas business in September quarter based on end-market demand was down 6.1% over a year ago quarter, Europe was down 12.9%, and Asia was down 12.6%. We did expedience our business being weaker in September than we had expected in the month of September. This weakness was also reflected in the lower studying backlog for the December quarter as well as the unusually low distribution inventory exiting the September quarter.From an end-market standpoint, industrial, automotive and consumer appliances end-markets are down significantly, aerospace and defense and communication markets have been flattish, and data center market has been strong. The uncertainty in all geographies is continuing. In this environment, direct customers and especially the distributors are continuing to manage the working capital by reducing inventory.However, there are some signs of inflection point too. In the September quarter, distributor inventory was down to 29.6 days. We have had only one quarter in the past 15 years, which was the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, where our days of inventory at distribution have been lower than the current levels.Secondly, booking for the month of October were the highest booking achieved since June of 2018. While the backlog for December quarter is much lower than the backlog for September quarter, at the same point in the quarter, the slope of the backlog fill for the current quarter is much steeper. With steeper backlog fill, where the backlog in shipments end up is a guessing game, especially with the holidays coming. Our judgment is that the net sales based on selling revenue recognition will take another leg down this quarter. But with several indicators showing inflection point, we may see the forming of a bottom here even though we saw a false bottom back in the March of this year when trade dispute was not resolved.We expect GAAP net sales based on selling revenue recognition for our products to be between minus 2% to minus 10% sequentially in the December quarter. Due to this sharp reduction in GAAP sales at the midpoint of the guidance, we are taking steps to reduce our manufacturing capacity, capital expenditures as well as expenses.We are planning to reduce the clean room footprint in our Colorado 6-inch fab that we acquired with Atmel acquisition. At 6-inch wafer size, the fab is no longer competitive with other high volume 8-inch fab. Therefore we will be turning the 6-inch fab into a discrete and specialty fab doing silicon carbide field effect transistors, the transistors, MEMS and other discrete devices. We will be transferring high volume Atmel products from the 6-inch Colorado fab to our 8-inch fab in Arizona and Oregon. This transfer will take about 12 months to complete, largely because we brought up the highest volume process in 8-inch fabs for dual sourcing earlier.In addition, we will be transferring some of the discrete products from Microsemi 4-inch fabs to the 6-inch fab in Colorado. These actions will create about $65 million in cost of good savings per year when completed. The first phase of this transfer will take about one year to complete and will achieve about two thirds of the savings. The balance of the transfers have a long tail and we’ll take another two years after the first phase.Regarding capital expenditures, we’re reducing our CapEx for fiscal year 2020 to be between $90 million and $100 million for the year, a reduction of $25 million from our guidance on CapEx last quarter. Regarding the reduction OpEx, we’re doing three things. Some of those are continuation of what we have been doing. First, we are approving new and replacement acquisitions very sparingly. Second, we will be managing discretionary spending very tightly. And third, our bonus program will yield a lower payout for the reduction in net sales.For December quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61% and 61% of sales – gross margin to be between 61% and 61.4% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 26.2% and 28% of sales. We expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 33% and 35.2% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.12 per share to $1.32 per share.Given all the complications of accounting for acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis except for net sales which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.With this operator, will you please poll for questions.
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] All right, we’ll take our first question from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess the first question Steve, is the expectations for sell-in versus sell through in the December quarter. You already said that the distribution channel inventory is at a record low. So, is this guidance for December suggesting that that end demand is actually declining in December? Could you explain the difference there?
Steve Sanghi: The end demand is declining. There has been some destruction of end demand in various end-markets. So, automotive clearly where the number of units build in automotive are much lower in U.S., Europe, and China. The industrial market end demand has been weaker because of all the impact of tariffs and increased cost and similar thing we’re seeing in the home appliances market. So, yes, the end demand is weaker and sell-in we’re guiding down. We do not know what the net to distribution inventory will be in terms of increasing or decreasing, whether end-market demand will be higher than GAAP sales or lower slightly. But we think they could be roughly in the same range and could go either way.
Chris Caso: Right. Okay. As a follow-up then, maybe you can reconcile that with your comments of the potential of this inflection point. I guess what I understand you’re saying is the opening backlog coming into the quarter was lower, but you’re seeing stronger fill as you go through the quarter. How are you reconciling that better order fill with the prospect of end demand, perhaps a bit weaker?
Steve Sanghi: So, how we are reconciling it is the starting backlog in the quarter was significantly more weaker than minus 6% guidance at the midpoint, significantly weaker. So, some of that – fair amount of that has closed in the last five weeks because the curve of backlog fill is much deeper. And we are expecting that that kind of curve will continue and will end up really close to the guidance for providing, but where we end up would still be lower than the last quarter. It will require significantly more steeper curve to be even with the last quarter. So, we are expecting improvement because of steeper curve, but it doesn’t get us to flat compare to last quarter.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yeah, and it probably is worth repeating what Steve has already said that our October 2019 bookings were the strongest month of bookings we’ve seen since June 2018.
Chris Caso: All Right. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: For the kind of a lot of mixed messages, weaker backlog, but some inflection points and still leaves very hard to read in this environment. We said back in February that could be bottom, but it was very much tied to the trade settlement. We didn’t get it. So, this time, we’re just being cautious and giving you all the puts and takes.
Chris Caso: Right. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we’ll go with Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Gary Mobley: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. You mentioned that sort of the retooling of your Colorado facility could bring on maybe a 50 basis point positive impact to gross margin long term. The near term looks like we’re contemplating the 100 basis point sequential decrease. How much of that degradation, the gross margin near term is due to underutilization and how much is due to mix?
Ganesh Moorthy: I can address that and Steve can add on to it. So, the quarter we just completed, we had underutilization charge are about $8.9 million. That charge will be higher in the December quarter. So, that is having an impact on gross margins that we’re seeing on a sequential basis. There’s always things like product mix that factor into it also. And then with demand down, it’s likely that we’ll have some accounting charges related to obsolescence doesn’t mean that the product isn’t good anymore, but we’ll have some obsolescence charges that will also impact the gross margins that we produce this quarter.
Gary Mobley: Okay. And just – I know it’s very, very early to call, but could you give us some sense of seasonal trends in the March quarter, based on past history and perhaps how you are feeling about the linearity bookings as we see here today?
Steve Sanghi: Well, seasonality is the hardest one to talk about, because of various acquisitions that we have completed. Prior to the Microsemi acquisition, for example, our end-market mix was dominated by industrial, automotive and consumer appliances. With the addition of Microsemi now, we have added three other significant end-markets, aerospace and defense, datacenter and communication where we had very little exposure. And last year, year or five quarters since we’ve had Microsemi, the environment hasn’t been normal. A significant inventory correction in the last June and September of last year, and then subsequently, fighting through the U.S. China trade sanctions and all the other issues. So, we haven’t really seen a combined company normal environment for a year or longer to be able to figure out what the seasonality with the current mix is.So, I think that would be my answer that we – at the minus 6% of the midpoint, clearly that is below seasonal. We’re not defending that it is seasonal. Prior to any of this acquisition, I think seasonality for December quarter used to be about minus 3 if I remember. We don’t know where it is today.
Gary Mobley: All right. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll next go with Vivek Arya from the Bank of America.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I was hoping you could help us understand the chronology here, because back in August, you gave some guidance, then in September, you kind of confirm the midpoint of that guidance. At that time, the hope was that September would be a normal month. And since then, the results are about, 11-ish million somewhat below. So, not bad, but somewhat below. And since that time, we have just heard such a wide range of views from here, you know one of your peers was very weak, but then most others have kind of been in line. And now, you’re saying that October bookings are very strong but backlog is very weak. I think investors are just horribly confused as to what’s really going on, what is driving such a week backlog and what is now driving the subtitle, what is causing all this?
Steve Sanghi: Vivek, in terms of confusion, join the party. I mean this has been a very, very confusing environment. On one hand, they’ve been fits and starts on the trade front, and the three largest of our markets which are industrial, automotive and consumer appliances heavily hit with large amount of tariffs and therefore they have a lot of demand destruction. In anytime you make any kind of guess with some resolution of the trade dispute, it really hasn’t happened. And then you have had multitude of other issues with ZTE about a year ago then Huawei, you can ship is, not shipping then Hikvision and many other customers added. So, there has been a lot of confusion. And every company – I think if you look at the number a year-over-year, you will see that our performance year-over-year is pretty reasonable, but quarter-over-quarter, it just depends on when somebody went into inventory correction, how long the inventory correction lasted. We measured our September performance to the September performance of last year. However, September last year, we were still reporting numbers based on sell through revenue recognition as a non-GAAP. If you compare the numbers GAAP to GAAP, September quarter to September quarter, we were actually up, because last September quarter there was a substantial reduction in distribution inventory. I don’t know if it’s exactly correct.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yeah, we were not up but we had about an $80 million reduction last September in distribution inventory in that quarter.
Steve Sanghi: Yeah. So, as you compared to that, the number of get very confusing. So, in parallel with all these other confusions, last year, we also went through change of revenue recognition. So, I would say simply lay out the numbers for various companies and you will find that our year-over-year performance is better than the other large competitor you talked about.
Ganesh Moorthy: Vivek, in terms of chronology, the other thing to keep in mind is, if you remember, I think it was in early August, there were additional tariffs that were announced and were going to be taking place at various points in time. I think that creates more uncertainty in the market. And I think what happened was September ended up being a lot weaker as people were trying to sort out, customers are trying to sort out, what are they going to do. And that was reflected in distribution inventory going down, the overall results being less than what we had expected at the midpoint, and then beginning to reverse as we went into October, and then reflected in the guidance you’re seeing today.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And my follow-up, Steve, how much do you think distributors will be willing to take down inventory that you mentioned, this is the lowest that you’ve seen in the last I think 15 years or so that you mentioned definitely far below historical trends. What are you hearing from them? I understand the uncertainty, but at some point, do you think you see the benefits of perhaps say DIB crunching from the distribution channel or is it too early to give a sense for – what does normalize distribution level look for you?
Steve Sanghi: I think the macro trends in the demand destruction by the tariffs and all this confusion created a much larger impacts than the other secular trends of impact of another competitors in distribution and distribution putting more focus on us. Those things happen over two, three years. And the effect of trade friction and all that is really much more immediate and much more severe. So, we’ve been telling you now for a few quarters that the distribution inventory went down, the sell through in several quarters now, I would say at least five quarters had been better than sell-in. And when would think with distribution inventory now, lowest in 15 years except one strange quarter in fiscal year ‘13. It wouldn’t go down further, but we can’t be sure of it. Distributors don’t have confidence. The seeing the same issues we are seeing weakness in industrial market in automotive market and consumer appliance market, aerospace and defense and communications that kind of flattish, if distributors can manage their business, but even lower inventory they probably would.
Ganesh Moorthy: Right. They are going to leverage are generally short lead times to their advantage.
Steve Sanghi: Despite, reporting GAAP numbers based on selling you’re very well aware of a stance. We manage a business to sell through and we do not go request any distributor to take any kind of inventory stock for shelves. So, we are focused on sell through and sell through is weak and therefore the selling is weak.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for the comment.
Operator: Thanks. We will be taking our next question from Harsh Kumar from the Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Harsh Kumar: Yeah, thanks, Steve, for all the colors so far. I’m trying to square some of your comments. So, you’re taking some steps in OpEx and CapEx, but October suggesting from your commentary some sort of an inflection point upward. So, should we just read into it as okay maybe we’re not going to go down from the current guidance that you gave for December that sort of the new base should we look at and you’re just adjusting your business to get out? I guess be more profitable and more cash flow and just optimize it a little bit or is it from the last can read into it?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think what I'm reading into it is that we started the December quarter with much lower backlog on October 1 than it was in July 1. And you know if that had continued in the last five weeks, the guidance would be double digit negative. But we have made up significant gap by the fill being much stronger. And if that strength of that fill continues, then the results could be reasonably good. But there are also holidays coming, short month of November, short month of December, you know, Europe shuts off in the middle of December. So by all those puts and takes, our guess is that the December quarter still ends up about 6% lower than September quarter. And that minus 6% is a huge makeup from how low the backlog was in October one.And then with the strength of the bookings, October was strong bookings, November so far looks like good strong bookings. If the bookings continue, then hopefully the January one backlog for the March quarter could be better than what we experienced as a backlog on October 1. And with continued strength of booking, hopefully, we have some sort of recovery, but I'm not really giving any guidance for March yet.
Harsh Kumar: Understood. Thanks for the color, Steve. And I think earlier you mentioned that the classic Microchip as you call your core business from some acquisition to go typically down about 3% in December. You think some of that and maybe the Chinese New Year stack kind of closer to Christmas this time has some effect on you know, some small portion of your consumer business, you think part of that's going on, perhaps impacting September and then coming back up in October?
Steve Sanghi: I think, you know, earlier gentleman asked that we gave guidance in early September that we reconfirmed our midpoint of our guidance. So kind of what happened, you know Ganesh mentioned and I mentioned also the month of September was quite weak. Weaker than what we expected causing us to miss a sales by about $10 million, $11 million. You know, the month of October was much stronger and November is continuing much stronger. So, you know, could it be because of some sort of light at the end of the tunnel on first phase of settlement with China, could be the inventory has gone low enough. You know, there are all these puts and takes and we really have put them all on the table, you know, the good points and bad points. And then we gave you a judgment and you could make your own judgment or agree or disagree with ours. That's where it is. Numbers are very hard to call in this uncertain environment.
Harsh Kumar: Understood, Steve. Thank you for the color.
Operator: Thank you. We are taking next Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Shawn Harrison: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess my first would be, is there any way to quantify, I know you've talked about it a lot so far, just how much September disappointed in terms of either the backlog or actual sales? Would you have been tracking toward the higher end of guidance, otherwise?
Steve Sanghi: No. I mean when we reconfirmed our guidance, we were essentially tracking towards the midpoint. And September was weak causing us to miss by 11 million, am I correct? Yeah.
Shawn Harrison: And that's the amount that we should consider what the shortfall was also and kind of general backlog as well?
Steve Sanghi: No, the backlog was much, much weaker.
Ganesh Moorthy: Remember backlog cross us over into the December quarter and exceeding quarters as well.
Steve Sanghi: And then you know earlier I mentioned that the backlog started on October 1, the backlog was down in double digits compared to July 1. And if we are giving minus 6% guidance now you know even if 4% change would be $52 million, right, on our revenue number. And the backlog on October 1 started much worse than minus 10, significantly worse than minus 10. So, we have made up a huge amount of gap with significantly steeper slope.
Shawn Harrison: Very helpful. And just as a follow-up...
Steve Sanghi: Today ruler on the slope and get to a number and tell you that's the number. Unfortunately we have seen that you know, when the backlog start so low, can be a steeper slope but then the slope can change and it could end early in the middle of December and not fill during the holidays. So you got account for all that and that's why I keep stressing that there are lots of puts and takes. And putting them all into consideration, we're giving you guidance that we believe is where we're headed.
Shawn Harrison: It's very helpful. Steve, if I may a follow-up. Just the incremental weakness you saw in the backlog, was it more on the analog side of the portfolio or the microcontroller side?
Steve Sanghi: It was largely pretty much across the board.
Ganesh Moorthy: There's no product specific backlog that was weaker than the other.
Shawn Harrison: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We're next going to William Stein from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve, you've already told us that the weakness was very broad based by markets and by geo. I wonder if the strength or the very recent strong recovery in bookings trends could be attributed to anything in particular, any geo, any end-market, any event.
Steve Sanghi: So, I would say, if you have to pick a geography that has shown strength, it would be China.
William Stein: But nothing by end-market there. We've heard about China auto recovering significantly. Are you seeing that as well?
Steve Sanghi: Yeah, I mean, you know, we manage our business by product lines as you know. So, you know, we have rough end-market commentary, where we believe that the only stronger end-market has been data centers, communication and aerospace and defense were flattish, and automotive industrial and consumer appliances were the weakest markets. You know with a one month booking in October, we can't really, you know, tell you a change in that tone. We just don't track it that way.
William Stein: Thanks. One more if I can. With regards to the Microsemi system, that ERP integrations that you're doing. Can you remind us of the timing to complete these? And I just forget whether there's a step function cost savings that happens at the end of it all? Or is it more linear as we go and remind us of the size of that, please? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: So if you recall, we began this a year ago, and have had a number of transitions we make every quarter. We just did the most recent of that on November 1 of this year. In my prepared remarks, I said we have at least another four quarters to get substantially complete. We're about halfway through at this point in time. And the savings are more over time rather than a step function change. And as we get through enough of the systems, you know, we take the savings and that becomes a synergy that we add to what we've done.
Operator: All right, thank you. We're next going with Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I know it's always tricky to reconcile SIA data with your results, but if I look at SIA data for calendar Q3, the overall general MCU market grew about 5% sequentially. But almost all of that growth came from 32-bit, while 8-bit decline, 16-bit was relatively flattish sequentially. You've grown the size of your 32-bit pretty strongly, but I think it's still about a third of your overall MCU business. So mix adjusted because you still have more 8-bit and 16-bit exposure. Is this the potential reason why your MCU business slightly underperformed the general industry in the September quarter?
Steve Sanghi: We have not analyzed the numbers again for SIA, so I'd rather not guess and make any comments. I think you know our – you mentioned end-market demand base microcontroller business was down 1.3%. I think many other results we have heard from various companies wouldn't lead us to believe that the business in September quarter was up 5%. I don't know how SIA comes up with the numbers, if you add up the numbers from TI and others, I don't know whether I can construct that number.
Ganesh Moorthy: Our 32-bit business is doing, you know, much stronger than 8-bit and 16-bit. I think these are businesses that are not as much 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit focused. They are broad market trends in automotive and industrial, in consumer appliances and they affect all segments of the microcontroller market.
Steve Sanghi: Our belief is in history that you know SIA, you know, especially during turbulent times like this, they revise the numbers and the significant changes reported and it's easily causes confusion like it's causing right now. If I look at, add up the results of most companies, they make microcontrollers, I don't really think I can get SIA numbers.
Harlan Sur: You know, that's a fair point. Okay. And then my follow-up, you know, you've been to a couple of quarters of cloud data centers spending digestion, but looks like spending is picking up back here in the second half of this year. It looks like you guys are seeing that as well. I think via the Microsemi acquisition, you guys have a relatively strong position in NVMe enterprise is the controllers, you've got a strong platform for PCIe switching products. And then you've got some of your core products right like secure MCUs and Ethernet products that go into the cloud as well. Roughly how big is cloud data center as an end-market for the team? I assume it's probably a bit easier to track given that these products are purpose designed for data center applications?
Ganesh Moorthy: So the product lines that address data center are more than just the Microsemi product line that came to data center. Clearly that is a big position that we have some of what you mentioned relative to these strength and storage. The strength in the SSDs and all that is good. I don't know if I have a good way to break out exactly what our data center. It's in the mid-teens is what my guess would be based on where we had seen the combined company, but that's from several quarters ago.
Steve Sanghi: We also have products into data center from the classic Microchip business prior to the Microsemi. And some of those products go into power supplies, they go into, you know, other IO control and various different areas. So, we had some data center exposure before, but obviously, the big one came in Microsemi.
Harlan Sur: Yeah. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much for your question. [Operator Instruction] We'll take our next question from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I'll give it to one. The October bookings strength that the company spoke to, are those primarily bookings that are for shipment in the December quarter, or are some of those bookings for shipping in the March quarter and maybe giving you a good start on your backlog for the March quarter? Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: Those bookings are aged every month from here on and into the future six, eight months out. So some are for December quarter, some are for March quarter, some of it even spill beyond the match quarter.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer: Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve, to the entire December quarter, you've been pretty clear that your assumptions for terms are higher. I'm just kind of curious, given the strength you've seen quarter to date, from here on out, what's the expectations in terms of returns relative to trend? Do you expect – you need that steepness to continue to hit the midpoint or you embedding kind of a more normal turns in business in the second half of the quarter to hit the midpoint of guidance?
Steve Sanghi: So I'll speak qualitatively rather than quantitatively because we haven't disclosed what the backlog was, where it is now and all that. If the current slope of backlog fill continues, then the results will be very good. We're not expecting the slop to continue. So we in our judgment have moderated that slope, current slope. Some just because the backlog started very low and then people place the order, slope is high, as backlog starts to fill up, the slope will moderate. And the other is the effect of holidays, because you know, you don't do a lot of bookings over the Thanksgiving week. And then December, Europe is weak as usually, U.S. is second and then you know, Asia usually continues to work over the holidays. So we have based on our experience from our history, we have model that in. But I will admit that we have moderated that slope because we think the slope is not sustainable.
Eric Bjornholt: I think I'll also point out that we've given broad range of guidance.
Steve Sanghi: And we have given a pretty broad range of guidance to account for all those puts and takes.
Operator: Thank you. We're taking our next question from Chris Danely from Citigroup.
Christopher Danely: Hey, thanks, guys. I'll try to stick to one question. Steve, is this I guess, sluggish type of environment continues into the March quarter. Theoretically, what would you be looking to do as far as OpEx goes in your own inventory?
Steve Sanghi: Well, if the sluggish environment were to continue, the OpEx would be basically in the range. We will keep on you know, controlling any headcount additions, sparingly approve any replacement acquisitions. Bonus will continue to be lower, you know, then the target type of bonuses. You know, CapEx will, you know, continue to tighten, because if there's no growth, we will need capacity. And a lot of the capital we're investing is just incremental here and there is no big capital needed for growth in this environment. So, you know, those are the things we would do if the environment continues to be sluggish. If the environment were to accelerate, you know, I would think we still have sufficient capacity and sufficient inventory to ship the upside. So you wouldn't see a growth in, you know, CapEx immediately and you wouldn't see growth in expenses either. So if the upside in revenue were to come through, I think there will be a pretty good leverage for the earnings to go to the bottom.
Christopher Danely: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. We'll next go with Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho Group. Please go ahead.
Vijay Rakesh: Thanks. Just Steve and Eric, just briefly – you talked about inventory has come down quite a bit. I was just wondering if the visibility extended to the end customer also, have you seen the end customers stock up ahead of the tariffs or you think inventories going out to the end customers have come down as well?
Ganesh Moorthy: You know, we really have no meaningful visibility into end customers and what they're doing with their inventory. They don't report to us. We don't see the change from week to week as we do in the case of distribution. So you know, they are – we presume doing what they think is the right thing for their business. But we have no color one way or the other.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And I know you mentioned October you saw a nice snapback or a pickup in backlog most different China. Given the – Steve mentioned auto and industrial where the weakest, would expect those to snap back faster than others if we see some rebounder? That's it. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: So it's really hard to call future by end-markets. It's easier to talk about the past. Yeah, if there's some sort of trade settlement, there was to be clear rules were overnight to another tweet, you know, the duties will not go higher or something then you would see some stability and return to normalcy on the industrial market and appliance market. Automotive, there is a settlement with GM and GM know, and so you should see some impact there. So I think those are the things that would show strength. Yes.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: We'll next go with Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna International Group.
Christopher Rolland: Thanks for the question. Steve, thanks for all this big picture stuff. In your experience, maybe you can talk about how this cycle has been different from prior ones. You know, kind of what most surprised you this time around? And then how do you feel about this being a more of a semiconductor specific driven cycle versus you know, an economic cycle? And do you have any thoughts on an economic cycle, given how long this economic cycle has lasted?
Steve Sanghi: Well, that's a tough ball that you have served. You know I'm not an economist and that's not my field. So I'll give you some feel for really, you know how I'm thinking. Many of the cycles our industry has seen are the cycles created by our own industry through lonely times, excessive inventory build, and then the bubble bursting and going the other way and company shipping below demand for a while and then the cycle correcting. So those are, you know, semiconductor industry and its customer cause cycles by successively under shipping demand and over shipping demand. This cycle hasn't been caused by the industry. This cycle has been caused by the much larger economic forces. And if I were to name a single one, it will be the U.S. China trade. It’s really been caused by that.I tried to explain it before and let me take another shot at it. The world economy runs on manufactures building the product and putting into the inventory with a forecast that the customers will come and buy that product. Now given an example of a grocery store, or an electronic store, you can go into the stores, there is lots of inventory and you can come out with bags full of your grocery. You do not order your grocery a week ahead of time and then go pick up the delivery. In fact, if you were to go into the grocery store which you want, it isn’t there, you will go to another store and buy it.So, world economies are largely run on inventory. Now, enter the tariff uncertainty, imagine a customer building the product in China and let’s say there were no tariffs on it and bringing it to U.S. – I’m sorry – they were tariffs on it, there is 25% tariff format. So, they bring the product to U.S. with 25% tariff on it and having then the uncertainty to be able to pass on that tariff to the end customer. They don’t know whether they can or they can’t. And the second risk is to bring the inventory to U.S. and then there is settlement announced. Once a settlement is announced, no end customer will pay the 25% tariff, because the manufacturer brought it here with tariff at their own risk. So, what it does is it makes everybody stop in their tracks. They cut down the inventory on the loading dock to the manufacturing lines, to the raw material, to the finished goods, to the transportation hubs everywhere, people draw down the inventory, because they do not know what the landed cost is and what they can pass to their customers. That is the impact we have seen in many, many of the market. And when there is the clarity on the tariff front, then you will see the rebuilding of that supply chain inventory, which would have a very positive effect on us.
Christopher Rolland: Got it. Thank you for that extra insight. Very helpful. Yeah, that’s great. Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. We’re going next with Gil Alexandre from the Darphil Associates. Please go ahead.
Gilbert Alexandre: Good evening. I assume as you look at your long term models that you still have gross margins at 63% and operating margins at 40.5%, once we get over these problems?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, Gil. We have not changed a longer term model. In fact, the changes we announced today on the restructuring of our Colorado fab and bringing some of those 6-inch products to our higher volume 8-inch fabs and really creating $65 million in savings and the process. What we have done is we have lowered the revenue at which we achieve our target model. So, prior to that, it required a certain amount of revenue to fill up our factories and remove the underutilization to achieve a 63% target margin. By making those changes we are not galvanized for you how much, but we have lowered the revenue we need to achieve to achieve the target margin because we’re taking so much cost out of the system.
Gilbert Alexandre: Thank you. May I just ask one question on China and you can skip it.
Steve Sanghi: Go ahead.
Gilbert Alexandre: You talk of this 25% tariff. Have you seen any talk that they may – that people want to reduce that tariff or is that all open ended?
Steve Sanghi: You have some information you are sharing.
Ganesh Moorthy: Are you talking about the trade discussion between the U.S. and China? Because I think that is that the entire point is going to be, the 25% tariff is creating uncertainty on both sides of the ocean, is creating uncertainty in other regions of the world as well.
Steve Sanghi: In phase one settlement that has been touted by the administration, the 25% tariff doesn’t go away. They only agreed to not increase the tariff from 25 to 30, but there is some talk whether it’s in phase two or gets done in phase one with certain $100 billion worth of goods, the tariff will go down, but those are just talk so far?
Ganesh Moorthy: I think we see different news reports. We don’t have any direct insight into the discussions and decisions. I think there is a, in good faith effort to try to deescalate from where we are, and it may take more than one phase, but the rate at which that comes down and the time when it impacts, the products that we are designed into, our customers are impacted by is unclear to us.Even if there is a settlement, which creates a finality, the tariffs are not zero, tariffs are some number 10%, 15%, but they are constant and it’s not going to be another tweet which is going to increase those tariffs. Once the customers, distributors, contract manufacturers, everybody has that finality and they can run the business in a normal way and the inventories will get replenished. It is the uncertainty which causes it because they don’t know what the landed cost will be.
Gilbert Alexandre: I want to thank you. Good luck.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Gil. Anything else, Operator?
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Craig Ellis from B. Riley FBR.
Carlin Lynch: Hey guys, this is Carlin Lynch on for Craig. Just wanted to ask a question on the cross selling opportunities with Microsemi. I think last quarter, you had said that the muted environment had kind of slow down some of that progress. If we were to get to a normalized environment next year, could we see those cross selling opportunities kind of springboard? Is the design activity going on and or just seeing muted demand everywhere, or any kind of qualitative color you could give on the cross selling opportunities would be great?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, as you note, the cross selling opportunities are all at the design in stage. So, these are platforms that get designed and then go to production over 18, 24 months of time. The design in activity is going extremely well. And across the board, the combined sales teams, combined business unit teams of Microchip are all highly focused on enabling that a new design. The environment today is really for products of design back in time. And that muted environment doesn’t change. But the seeds are being planted, new designs and the increased total system solutions were able to address are clearly will pay off in time as the current – as the new designs go to production in, 12, 18, 24 months of time.
Carlin Lynch: So, just if I could clarify there. So we would expect some of that cross selling opportunity to start to manifest next year, even if the demand environment kind of just skips along the bottom here?
Steve Sanghi: Yeah, and you got to take it over time, if this is not a single application, single customer that drives in one way or another. There’s hundreds of applications customers over which this would happen. But clearly there is a multiplier that comes from cross selling from selling a more complete solution to the customer. And as that ramps in, I don’t know if it is exactly first half of next year, second half, but in time, as the environment improves, these new designs go to production, we will see the benefits that come from it.
Carlin Lynch: All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. We’re going next to Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach: Question for Steve. One of the secondary impacts of the trade war is just the acceleration of China to try to move to more of a localization effort. Can you talk about just maybe parts of your portfolio where you see maybe some overlap to that versus other parts that you think, a lot more immune to what China might be trying to do from a development perspective?
Steve Sanghi: So, we hear a lot of talk and we don’t see a lot of action on that front. There may be action on certain product lines, I think they’re really maybe trying to build processes and graphic processes and others, we do not really see that can impact today on our data center products, on our FPGA products, on our discrete and other products, our microcontroller analog, we hear a lot of talk about it. In longer term, there could be an issue where they want to either design their own product or not prefer to design with Americans. I think in a short period of time, less than a year of this trade war, you can’t really design a massive portfolio that microchip has to make a meaningful impact on it. So, we really not seeing that on revenue today, but we seeing it in sentiment.
Ganesh Moorthy: And I would add to it, the threat from local suppliers in China is nothing new. It's been there for many years. It's a question of do they have the types of products, the quality of the product, the capability to support the designs, the wide range of applications and customers that you need to be able to serve with it. You know, that is a very large task. And they may be more environment today that says, you know, you should consider more of a local supplier, but the task is very, very large for anybody who wants to do it. And if they could, they would have been doing it for several years before.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We're going to Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for the very quick follow-up. Actually I wonder those same lines in terms of competition and substitution. Steve, have you seen any design shifts to your – perhaps your European or Japanese competitors who have been in the market for a longer period of time? You know, does that become a factor going forward?
Steve Sanghi: You know, like I said, first we have a very, very broad customer base, we serve over 120,000 plus customers. So it's very, very hard to track. We're not seeing any preponderance of evidence to see there is any design shift. We're hitting in sentiment, the so called non-sentiment, you may have, you know, heard that kind of language where, you know, government is saying, you know, design with Chinese customers first, design with Taiwanese or Asian is second, you know, design with the Europeans third, and Americans the last. But you know, 95%, 97% of products we build at all proprietary nature with no pin compatible part available. So in a short period of time, we really haven't seen any of that shift.The shift will first become visible at the design stage if it does, and I don't think we have strong evidence today that that's happening. We're not losing designs like crazy. Our funnel size is still very, very large. And we're able to leverage a lot of our more commodity like products with more advanced products, but the total system solution if they're on the same board.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: This cause for concern and we're watching and we are making the product better, finding other sales mechanisms to bundle it and all that. So negative sentiment in China is definitely there, but it's not really, you know, being seen in bookings and revenue dollars today.
Operator: Thank you. It appears that there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Sanghi, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Well, I want to thank everyone. This has been a difficult year with all the uncertainty. Please continue to bear with us and we'll see some of you on the road as we go to various conferences. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now go ahead and disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2019-08-07 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Please standby. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip’s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2020 financial performance. And Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on our ongoing integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the investor relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results.We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website and I understand that those schedules aren’t showing up right away but we should have that issue corrected very shortly here for all of you.I want to remind listeners that during the June quarter of 2018, we adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition standard which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to the distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy where revenue on such transactions was deferred until the product was sold by our distributor to an end customer.As discussed in previous earnings conference calls, we continue to track and measure our performance internally based on direct revenue plus distribution sell-through activity and each quarter we'll provide a metric for this called end-market demand in our earnings release. Therefore along with our GAAP and non-GAAP results based on distribution sell-in, we will also provide investors with our end-market demand based on distribution sell-out but will not provide a P&L based on end-market demand.End-market demand in the June 2019 quarter was $1.35 billion which was up 0.7% sequentially from the March 2019 quarter. End-market demand was about $27 million more than our GAAP revenue in the June quarter. I will now go through some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.Net sales in the June quarter were $1.323 billion which was down 0.5% sequentially and slightly below the midpoint of our guidance of $1.33 billion. I remind you that our guidance for the quarter was made prior to the ban on shipments to Huawei which has historically been between a 1% and 2% revenue customer for us. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales and end-market demand by product line and geography on our website for your reference.On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 62%, operating expenses were 25.8% of sales and operating income was 36.2% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $357.6 million, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a $1.41 which was $0.035 above the mid-point of our guidance of $1.375. On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.6% and include the impact of $4.9 million of share based compensation, total operating expenses were $643.6 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $248.5 million, special charges of $8.1 million, $9.6 million of acquisition related and other costs and share based compensation of $35.8 million.The GAAP net income was $50.7 million or $0.20 per diluted share. Our June quarter GAAP tax benefit included $12.6 million of discrete income tax benefits primarily related to tax reserve release due to a statute of limitation expiring. The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 5.5% in the June quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal 2020 to be between 5% and 6% exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as U.S. interest deductions that will that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The future cash tax payments associated with the transition tax is expected to be about $246 million and will be paid over seven years with $10 million of that being paid this quarter.We have posted a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2019 was $733.1 million. We had 132 days of inventory at the end of June, up four days from the prior quarters level. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter were at 32 days compared to 35 days at the end of March. We believe that barring any negative developments on the U.S., China trade front, our distributors are holding a reasonable albeit lower than normal level of inventory to support end-market demand.The cash flow from operating activities was $380.6 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $437.1 million, we paid down $257.5 million of total debt in the June quarter and the net debt on the balance sheet was reduced by $263.7 million. Our EBITDA in the June quarter was $537.1 million and our trailing 12-month EBITDA was $2.212 billion. Our net debt-to-EBITDA excluding our very long dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and as more equity like in nature was 4.65 at June 30, 2019. We are committed to using substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond our dividend payments to reduce our debt levels and we expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years.Our dividend payment in the June quarter was $87.1 million, capital expenditures were $23.9 million in the June quarter, we expect about $30 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to be between $110 million and $130 million. We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities of our new products and technologies and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect these capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business particularly for the outsource Actel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories.Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $46.2 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter and provide an update on some of our ongoing Microsemi integration activities. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric and good afternoon everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to clarify that the product line comparisons I will be sharing with you today are based on end-market demand which is how Microchip measures its performance internally. Also with the start of a new fiscal year and a full-year of Microsemi results under our belt, we are making an adjustment to our product line reporting for our conference calls.We will continue to provide product line reporting for microcontrollers, analog and FPGA which make up almost 90% of our revenue. We will report licensing, memory and MMO or multi-market and other as a fourth category called LMO which stands for licensing memory and other which is about 10% of our revenue. Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our Microcontroller business was sequentially up 1.8% compared to the March quarter reflecting some strength in what otherwise continues to be broad macro weakness in the markets we serve.During the quarter, we shipped our 25 billionth microcontroller, a milestone in our rich heritage as a microcontroller solutions provider. We also continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers including several new touch screen microcontrollers with industry leading noise immunity with screen sizes of 9 to 20 inches. The industry's first commercially available Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface known as eSPI to low pin count known as LPC bridge product for industrial computers, the addition of a single port solution to our USB smart hub family targeted at entry level automotive applications.And last but not least we unveiled our META-DX1 family of Ethernet devices the industry's first terabit scale Ethernet device that enables high density 400 Gigabit Ethernet and flexible rate Ethernet connectivity. Microcontrollers represented 53.8% of our end-market demand in the June quarter.Now moving to analog, our analog business is sequentially down 0.7% compared to the March quarter reflecting the broad macro weakness, Microchip and others in the industry are experiencing. During the quarter, we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products including the production release of our 700 volt silicon carbide MOSFETs as well as our 700 Volt and 1200 volt silicon carbide Schottky barrier diodes. High precision 16 bit and 24 bit analog to digital converters and IEEE 802.3 compliant Power Over Ethernet switch and the industry's first clock buffers that meet PCIe Generation 4 and Generation 5 specifications. Analog represented 28.5% of our end-market demand in the June quarter.Our FPGA end-market demand reached an all-time record even after going back through the Microsemi and Actel history with 7% sequential growth compared to the March quarter coming in at almost $101 million, the FPGA business does have some lumpiness because of our significant exposure to space, aviation and defense markets where procurement timing can be a function of programs and their shifting priorities schedules and budgets.Design wins on our new low power mid-range PolarFire family continue to grow strongly and we remain optimistic about this product family adding another leg of growth for the future. FPGA represented 7.5% of our end-market demand in the June quarter. Our licensing, memory and other product lines which we refer to as LMO was sequentially down 4.9% in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter reflecting the broad macro weakness that Microchip and others in the industry are experiencing.Collectively, LMO represented 10.2% of our end-market demand, a quick update about the ongoing Microsemi integration, business units and sales have substantially completed their integration activity. We are pleased with the synergies we have achieved since we closed the transaction despite the weaker macro environment over the last four quarters.As we said before, Business Systems and Operations Integration will take a longest time to complete as we execute this transition in phases, we expect the overall business and operational integration will take about another 12 months to complete and we expect continued synergy gains for many quarters to come. Finally, a short update about the Huawei situation from our perspective.We estimate that our exposure to Huawei to be approximately 1% to 2% of our end-market demand. Our revenue with Huawei is a combination of what we ship to them directly as well as what we ship indirectly to their subcontractors and in some cases through distributors. We stopped all shipments of Huawei when the Department of Commerce issued that Export Administration Regulation or EAR in May. About a month after that based on further analysis of the EAR, we began allowing shipments of Huawei for several products that were permissible to ship under the EAR.However the benefit for the June quarter was limited as Huawei in many cases did not want the product since they could not complete their bill of materials. There remains continued uncertainty as to whether Huawei will want all that we can ship this quarter as they may or may not be able to complete their bill materials. Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh and good afternoon everyone. Today I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2020. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2020. Before I analyze our June quarter results, I want to remind everyone that our guidance for June quarter was provided before the ban on shipments to Huawei was announced. The midpoint of our guidance was flat sequentially, Huawei is approximately 1% to 2% of our revenue and about half the quarter was impacted.Our June quarter GAAP net sales based on selling revenue recognition was down half a percent sequentially and without the Huawei ban, it would have been slightly positive. Our end-market demand based on sell-through was 0.7% up sequentially and would have been higher without the Huawei ban. The end-market demand was stronger than sell-in revenue which is consistent with our thesis that the channel is continuing to manage their working capital conservatively by reducing inventory due to uncertainty.As we stated on our February conference call, our view that the March quarter would mark the bottom for this cycle based on end-market demand is proving to be correct. This statement is also proving to be correct for GAAP revenue after excluding the impact of the Huawei ban. So given very difficult and uncertain market conditions, we are pleased with the net sales results that we have delivered. Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin at 62% was right at the midpoint of our guidance.Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 36.2% also was at the mid-point of our guidance. The integration of Microsemi continues to proceed very nicely since the closing of the acquisition, we are continuing to see strong synergies and improvement in gross and operating margins for Microsemi products. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was $1.41 and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.035 per share.On non-GAAP basis, this was also our 115th consecutive profitable quarter, a tribute to the employees of Microchip including employees from all of our acquisitions for their contribution to our success. In the June quarter, we paid down $257.5 million of our debt. Our total debt payment since the end of June 2018 has been $1.414 billion. The pace of debt payments has been strong despite the weak and uncertain business conditions that we have experienced with some of the inventory correction quarters rolling-off from four quarter rolling calculations, we’re optimistic that the peak of our debt-to-EBITDA leverage is behind us and we should see meaningful continuing reductions in leverage in future periods.Now I will provide you guidance for the September quarter. While the uncertainty begin with U.S., China trade friction. The uncertainty has become global. Europe was the weakest geography for us during the June quarter. Our customers and distributors are blaming the weak business conditions in Europe to the effect of very weak exports to China as well as uncertainty due to Brexit.The largest economy in Europe, Germany is near recessionary levels with auto production down significantly. Our China business was actually up recovering from the Chinese New Year with more shipping days as we expected. While there is this continued uncertainty in Europe as well as the U.S., China trade relations given the multi-quarter inventory correction we have seen at the distributors and customers, we expect net sales for our products in the September quarter to be between flat to up 4% sequentially. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61.8% and 62.2% of sales, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 25.3% and 26.3% of sales.We expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 35.5% and 36.9% of sales and we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.37 per share to a $1.49 per share. Given all the complications of accounting for acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and an inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its reserves on non-GAAP basis except for net sales which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide for more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. With this operator, will you please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take the question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach: Great, thank you. Steve, thanks for the color by geography. As you look into the September quarter, do you expect similar trends in terms of the recent stabilization in China, Europe weakened and any thoughts on just North America, how that's holding up into September?
Steve Sanghi: So I think it should be reasonably similar. The September quarter is usually a good quarter in Asia and that should continue Asia and China but Europe should continue to be the weakest geography and America is sort of normal.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it, thank you.
Operator: We will now take your question with Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. So Steve over the last few quarters we have seen your distributors reduced inventory, I think in the last two quarters they've gone from 36 days to 35 now, 32 days. Is this kind of the bottom and can you give us some historical context that outside of -- outside of the financial crisis, what's the lowest the distributors have gone to in terms of holding inventory?
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So this is Eric Bjornholt. So if you look at the last 10 years, our distribution inventory days have ranged between 27 and 47. You have 32 days that's the lowest that we've definitely seen in several years. And we don't really think that it's going to go much lower than this. So I think it's probably relatively stable here. But our distributors are definitely managing their working capital requirements given the uncertainty of the environment and last quarter we had made similar commentary that we didn't think it would go much lower and it went down by about three days. But we think this is likely to bottom. But it could fluctuate by a day or two in either direction. That's definitely possible.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: We'll now take a question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.
Harsh Kumar: Hey guys, quick question Steve. Seems like you sound a little bit more bullish than you have in the past three or four calls. I'm curious if you can share specifics. You talked a little bit but specifics of maybe what you're seeing within China that that might give you some optimism or why you might have been up, any color in product segments and you think we can go back to normal growth from here including seasonality or we're going to kind of chug along the bottom a little bit?
Steve Sanghi: Well Harsh, it's always the same saga in every cycle. We usually see the cycles coming ahead of everybody else and you sort of see it ending ahead of everybody else and we get a large amount of disbelief from the audience on both sides of the cycle. So we have -- we first experience down cycle starting in about July, August last year. So we've been in it for a year and have been reducing inventory in distribution in channel, in major OEM customers and inside and after multi-quarter inventory correction, we are actually seeing the backlog is up from prior quarter and we are seeing some strength coming back.So that's really kind of what I'm reflecting while you're hitting some of the other people in the industry talking about multi-quarter inventory correction ahead of them because they either went into it much later or they continued to sort of I would say based on sell-in revenue recognition continue to have strong shipments into the channel which we did not do. So I think that's really what I'm reflecting. Other than that, I think there is a significant uncertainty in the U.S., China trade relations as well as Brexit deadline coming in three months. And I don't really know what will transpire there.
Harsh Kumar: Appreciate it, Steve. Thank you.
Operator: We will now take a question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys. This is Jamison calling in for Ambrish. So I was hoping you guys could talk about some of your receivables and notes that they're up about 6% quarter-on-quarter on a dollar basis and five days sequentially. And I understand that there was some classification, reclassification in your receivables last quarter. But can you talk about what is at play here or is it just a timing thing. And do you expect them to come down in the upcoming quarters? Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. That's a good question. So there's no reclassification that's occurring this quarter. That was something that we did as part of our year-end process in March. So this is really just based on the shipment linearity in the quarter one quarter the next that drove that to be a little bit higher and we would expect that to really kind of correct itself over time and kind of be more in line with what the revenue curve is going to be in the future. So hopefully that answers your question but there's nothing unusual going on in receivables, there's no receivables are in good shape and won't have any significant bad debts or anything like that. So all that should come to cash year over time.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks. And then my follow-up is regarding CapEx looks like your 2020 guidance is reducing towards $120 million which I believe is around give or take a 2% capital intensity and lower than the last several years. So I was wondering what is driving these reductions. Just lower demand and do you expect CapEx to stay around these levels in the near-term or tick back up towards the more historical 4% to 5% in the future?
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So we were in last fiscal year, fiscal 2019 we were putting capital in place at least early in the year for an expansion environment which didn't come to fruition. So we're very well positioned from a CapEx perspective of what's in place. We've reduced the CapEx in the current year by about $20 million from when we last talked to the Street and just managing the business appropriately in that environment. So we tend to go through peaks and valleys in CapEx but I'd say over time you should expect CapEx to be in the range of 3% to 4% of sales.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Eric Bjornholt: Welcome.
Operator: We will now take your question from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities.
Gary Mobley: Thanks guys. Eric I had couple questions for you on the gross margin and OpEx, I believe you are guiding for the June quarter for underutilization impact gross margin by 70 basis points. Was that the case and were you sort of discounting in your September quarter outlook and then with respect to the OpEx, non-GAAP OpEx, you're I think guiding for a $10 million sequential increase based on the midpoint of the guidance. That's the first increase in five quarters. I'm just wondering what's behind that?
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So we'll take it one at a time. So on the gross margin side, we did have underutilization charge again this quarter, it was pretty much in line with what it was in the previous quarter it was $7.3 million, I think that's up 200K quarter-on-quarter. We're running our factories kind of at an attrition level in most cases at this point in time, so production has been coming down or inventory is higher than kind of our normal operating levels of 115 to 120.And at this point in the cycle that is not unusual but overtime we do want to bring that inventory balance down. So that's really hit on gross margin. On OpEx, you're right we are guiding to an increase and we've managed operating expenses very tightly really since the September 2018 quarter and have really kind of beaten our guidance on OpEx in September, December and March quite significantly and came in kind of at the target in the current quarter and running the business conservatively but there are investments that we feel we need to continue to make in this business to drive the ongoing health of our business and future growth opportunities.So we view that change is relatively small in the current quarter as a percentage of revenue, it is targeted to be flat at the midpoint of guidance at 25.8%.
Gary Mobley: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: We'll now take a question from William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good results considering such a tough demand environment. I'm hoping you can quantify the dollar savings or the synergies that are remaining with regard to the Microsemi acquisition and your anticipated timing on achieving those? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: So I think we can order that genetically because really not at this point in time breaking results out. We had guided at the end of first year of our synergy to be at the radar for $0.75 per share on an annualized basis. We can tell you that we’re ahead of it, after one year we have really exceeded those targets. And then the longer-term three years synergy targets that we had identified were $1.75 which were and you can pick the second year numbers somewhere in between $0.75 and $1.75 and the $1.75 number was consisting of three items although we didn't provide a breakdown of those three items, one was the OpEx synergy, second one was COGS synergy with bringing stuff inside and improving gross margin.And the third one was the benefit coming from sales, incremental sales growth and all that. There was actually a fourth item which was tax although we originally did not mention tax. So as we look at it about a year and a quarter after, we are head of synergy targets on the expenses, we’re ahead of our synergy targets on the COGS side and we are ahead of our synergy targets on the tax side. So three out of four are ahead and one we are behind which is that revenue largely driven by the environment that we face. So that's kind of where we are.
William Stein: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take a question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Christopher Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess a question on some of the ongoing trade tensions and specifically some of the new tariffs are going to come into place. I know Steve you've been watching this closely with respect to your business. And I guess with this next round, do you expect any activity from the channel kind of pull forward, push outs as a result of that or going on long enough now that maybe there's some exhaustion in the channel and it's having a less of an effect. Appreciate your perspective.
Steve Sanghi: I think first thing I would say is that this is a second quarter in a row where there has been a significant tweak between the time we prepared our guidance and prepared our notes for the time, we delivered our guidance and delivered our notes and quarter-ago, I said the same thing in the conference call that based on that tweet we had to nudge the middle of our guidance down. We had to do exact same thing this time where we had to nudge the middle of our guidance slightly down because of the tweet and the extra tariffs to go into effect on September 1 whether that would happen or not.I think this is a whole lot of uncertainty. Nobody really knows what would happen what not. In terms of the tariffs that Microchip pays, the effect of this additional $300 million is virtually nothing. There could be small amount of our development tools or something, we're talking thousands of dollars not millions of dollars. So that is not effect. The effect really is how will Chinese customers behave in terms of buying our products to parts which are being exported back to China. Will the customers prefer to buy it from somewhere outside of China. And if they choose a brand outside of China, does that have also other parts of designed in or it’s not. And I think it’s always some in some, in some cases we will gain business because of the outside brand, outside of China has more of products and sometimes we lose because the given brand outside of China has more of the parts from Japan or Europe or somewhere. This is very, very hard to figure out especially when you're dealing with 120,000 plus customers. So hopefully we have navigated this well in the last one year. I think when you write the history of this last one year, I'm not sure how you would conclude that we were not correct.And hopefully we have navigated it correctly and have guided you correctly and all that wisdom, we have tried to put it in our guidance. That's the best I can say.
Christopher Caso: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll now take a question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Lots of recent consolidation maybe if you want to call it land grab for wireless connectivity assets especially Wi-Fi maybe you guys can just remind us on Microchip’s connectivity portfolio I believe it's pretty comprehensive. I know you guys have Bluetooth, Zigbee, Lora I believe you guys also have Wi-Fi capability but if you could just clarify that and if you can maybe qualitatively sort of quantify the attach rates of your connectivity solutions with your microcontroller platforms and opportunities that do require this type of connectivity capability?
Steve Sanghi: Okay, so you're right. We do have a pretty broad portfolio of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and other solutions. So just about all the major requirements that are standards based and even many that are proprietary based wireless solutions, we have in our portfolio. They have come through organic work and they've come through several of the acquisitions that we have done over time. So we don't have a particular glaring issue with a particular wireless requirement that we're not able to meet in the marketplace today.It doesn't mean we don't have new products, new innovations coming. Those are a normal part of doing the business itself. As far as attach rates go, we don't track as closely what is the attach rate of wireless, we think of systems, our customer systems needing to have smart connected and secure capabilities in them and we provide the building blocks of many different types of smart capabilities with our microcontrollers, processors, analog and other products many different connectivity options not just wireless, wireless and wired and we have a very leading portfolio of Wired analog of wired connectivity solutions as well. And then finally security itself. So that's how we go to market. Looking at how do we enable smart connected and secure solutions but we don't have to have a close tracking of how many of them have connected and off those that are connected how many of those are wireless and if they're wireless, what exactly is the standard that goes behind them.But we're very happy with the portfolio we have and are able to prosecute the markets and the businesses we want to be able to go after.
Harlan Sur: Yes, great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Matt Ramsey with Cowen.
Joshua Buchalter: Hi this is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results in a tough environment with gross margins hanging in pretty nicely, I was hoping if you could provide an update on the overall pricing environment you've seen through this down cycle. It seems like things have hung in there pretty well all things considered and it would be helpful to hear your view particularly how it compares to prior down cycles? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: So I think when we talk about pricing, I would say that the pricing has held up in this environment better than really it has held up in any business cycle before Microchip pricing in general held up in the prior business cycle also because so many of our products are proprietary but as you talk about this particular business cycle, I would say 95% of what we make today across various different business unit is proprietary where you cannot take our part out and plug somebody else's part in. So therefore we really have never competed for pricing at the buyer's desk.We often compete with pricing at the designer's desk which is usually two-years ahead of time and the part is going to go to production and whatever quotation you're making at the designer's desk, you have the time to achieve and do cross reduction or achieve the results you need to achieve when the part goes into production. Now especially in this cycle, I think it could be somewhat driven by the consolidation industry has seen, somewhat driven by the players who have been taken out where the weaker player in price management and some of them we ourselves took them out. I think a result of all that is that the pricing has held up or our record all-time high record gross margins, I believe were 62.23% that we made two or three quarters ago and the quarter we just announced that gross margins were 62.2%, that's 23 bps below the record and we're sitting at the bottom of the cycle.So I think that's good news as the cycle improves and as our factories get further full and as we complete the rest of the Microsemi integration and as we bring more of this stuff from outside to inside, the remaining stuff from Actel and some from Microsemi, it's really interesting to think about where this whole business model goes.
Joshua Buchalter: Very helpful, thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take your question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.
Craig Ellis: Thanks for taking the question and like many others congratulations on the good execution guys. Steve I wanted to follow-up on your remarks regarding an earlier synergies question. You mentioned that that the difficult macro environment has made it tough to realize revenue synergies which is understandable. But the question is this do you still think there is the same degree of revenue synergies that's possible from the combination. Or is there something about what's happened over the last year that would cause you to lower your view of longer-term synergies potential with revenues? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Yes, the opportunity for revenue synergies a theme and some of the earliest piece of revenue synergy where we have gotten our parts around Microsemi sockets and their part around Microchip socket is kind of already beginning to happen but the starting point is lower. The whole industry has lost significant amount from the top line as a starting point.So even though we may be adding a little bit of the revenue synergy already, the total revenue is still below where we started and that's the more difficult part but the longer-term as the industry recovers from the cycle there is the funnel is very healthy. The indicator we track internally which is the number of Microchip products per customer design, extremely proprietary indicator is continuing to increase and as the baseline business goes up, I think this should be working pretty well. So no we have not lowered the long-term target at all.
Craig Ellis: That's helpful, thank you. And then if I could ask a follow-up to Eric. Eric I recall when the Microsemi transaction was announced that there was an element of the debt burden that was variable rate. Can you confirm how much that is at present and given the decline in interest rates that we've seen especially over the last three to four years. When would that be expected to benefit the interest burden that exists on that debt?
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. Sure. So we have two pieces of variable rate debt in the portfolio. We've got a revolving line of credit and then a term loan B, the revolving line of credit had a balance of $3.197 billion at the end of June and the term loan was $1.724 billion. So roughly $4.9 billion of floating rate debt and we are seeing the Fed cutting interest rates that we are getting a benefit of that today. And that's been reflected in our guidance for the other expense that we've guided to the Street. That is the debt that we are paying down those still, we are paying down the variable rate debt and that come down, we should see the benefit in the overall operating results. Does that address your question?
Craig Ellis: Yes, it does. Thanks guys.
Steve Sanghi: So that variable debt was $1.414 billion higher a year ago. Everything we have paid has been variable so far. So that's what we have paid down in the last year.
Craig Ellis: Got it. Thanks Steve. Thanks Eric.
Operator: And we'll now take your question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon guys. Steve, thanks. Let me ask the question. Steve, I think one of the challenges that all the M&A you guys have done over the last several years has been both for the industry analysts and I think internally for you guys is to getting a better understanding of how seasonality is in your business? I'm kind of curious if you can give us some insights when you look at the September guide you just gave a flat-up for how did you peg that against sort of “normal seasonality” And I guess more importantly as you look into the December quarter, are you guys any closer to helping us understand what normal seasonality might look like in December?
Steve Sanghi: So I think John very, very good question. We always try to figure out the same pain. However seasonality is very hard to measure. Number one with all the acquisitions that keep changing the seasonality because different acquired businesses work differently but also in the current environment with trade tensions and general economic conditions, the variability on the business caused by the U.S., China trade friction and general economic conditions is much larger than any impact of seasonality.So we can't really compare this to any kind of seasonality. Seasonality is also driven by kind of how somebody was measuring the revenue. Historically, we measure the business based on sell-through revenue recognition and now based on the GAAP standard, we're having to report the numbers based on sell-in and sell-in and sell-through work differently. We have much more cycles learning on a sell-through revenue recognition on seasonality than we have on sell-in. So I think with changing revenue recognition totally different seasonality for Microsemi business with defense and aerospace and FPGA in discrete parts and uncertainty of China, U.S., Brexit and general economic conditions. I think this one remains a very, very good question with no real answer today.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful, Steve. If I could sneak one in. You did a very good job quantifying the impact of Huawei in the June quarter. I'm just kind of curious and I apologize if I missed this. What's embedded in the September guide. Is it a similar dollar magnitude or would it be more given that that you're taking a view of the entire quarter instead of just half the quarter?
Eric Bjornholt: It's not that easy to answer, it’s not only a function of what is it that we're allowed to ship but what is it that Huawei is able to use. And that is changing day by day as they get inputs from their various suppliers of what they can and cannot ship as well. So what we have built in is less than what a full board would be for a quarter. But it's a conservative estimate that we have put in with our best judgment of what we think Huawei is likely to take. And that changes day to day as we go along.
John Pitzer: Helpful, thanks guys.
Operator: We will now take your question from Christopher Rolland with SIG.
Christopher Rolland: Hey guys, thanks for the question. Any early feedback so far from your silicon carbide products. And then also do you guys have any plans or have you thought about expanding into other compounds semi's out there or perhaps even vertically integrating like guys like wanted to do and then Eric just one for you, the IT security remediation that you guys referenced in non-GAAP expenses, just any details on that? Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: So with respect to our silicon carbide products and the customer reaction has been extremely positive. I think that is driven by one, we are a known provider into some of the markets that care most about silicon carbide automotive in particular. But second what differentiates our silicon carbide solutions is the robustness of the product line and that robustness is measured in different ways that we've been able to demonstrate through test results. And in this area where there's very high voltages that are involved in the applications that need silicon carbide robustness is highly valued in what we've done. So the discussions with customers are going well, there's high interest in the product line. It's early days as we are launching and then starting to go into design and activities with them. With respect to any other compounds that we might be looking at. There's really nothing exotic at this point to talk about and we need to really harvest the places where we have investments and make sure they go into production and in time there may be other things we would do but nothing to report on at the moment. Eric?
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. And then on the security matter, I mean we kind of fully disclosed this in our 10-K which was filed in late May that we had a security incident that we are in the process of remediating and it did cause a weakness in our internal controls. So we are working hard on remediating that issue and that that's really what those costs are associated that we are excluding from the non-GAAP results.
Christopher Rolland: Thanks guys.
Operator: We'll now take your question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya: Steve I had a longer-term question, do you think because of the U.S., China trade conflict there is the possibility of market share shifting onto non-U.S. microcontroller companies, I understand there's obviously nothing near-term but do you think that becomes a risk factor longer term?
Steve Sanghi: That suddenly becomes a risk factor, if Chinese were to think that designing parts from suppliers outside the U.S. is safe for although they have similarly strange relationships with Japan. I'm not sure they like those people either. The other thing is you have to look at the complexity of the products, so commodity products probably would be more subject to risk than many of our advanced products in their datacenter business, communication business, FPGA, 32-bit microcontrollers, networking products, USB, Ethernet, automotive and others where some of the commodity products will be more vulnerable.So but I think what is happening right now is that we’re seeing a large number of customers starting to move their production outside of China, they’re going to Malaysia, they're going to Thailand, they’re going to Vietnam, they're going wherever some may come to Mexico. So I think we're likely to pick up share in that part of the business that moves outside of China because in the local competition kind of disappears, they largely sell in China and many times passing out a very high quality and they maybe okay for the local Chinese market but naturally okay internationally. So there could be some longer-term impact from that but I think it's largely going to be a wash. Every decade or so another country appears that seems to threaten the world back in the 1980s and Japan was going to take everything and U.S. semiconductor industry was going to die in the 1990s, it was Korea then, then it was Japan, Taiwan and now seems to be China. I think this industry is still pretty innovative and it will survive in the world.
Vivek Arya: If I could sneak in a quick follow-up on gross margins. If I add back the underutilization charges, you're getting close to your longer-term 63% target. Is that the upper limit, is there something in the portfolio that kind of limits you to those kind of gross margins or do you think there is a potential to do better over time? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Well we haven't hit it yet, once we hit it then we'll take a look at it. But yes as I mentioned earlier that the gross margins we have today are I think 600 basis points or so better than in the bottom of the last cycle. So there is a significant accretion usually from the bottom of the cycle to the top of the cycle. So there's a significant opportunity here. Not willing to talk about another target yet but I think your question is a good one.
Vivek Arya: Thanks Steve.
Operator: We’ll now take your question from Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities.
Hans Mosesmann: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in congrats guys on a tough environment execution there. Hey Ganesh maybe this is one for you. For the FPGA business, how much of that is coming from aerospace, defense and aviation?
Ganesh Moorthy: So we don't break it out by segments but sufficed to say based on whatever data has been provided previously through Microsemi or Actel, it is a significant portion of the business that's where many of the differentiation of the FPGA product line was built around low power around security, around robustness, reliability et cetera which are highly valued there. But it is a pretty significant amount that is also in non-aerospace and defense business and it's growing in those areas quite a bit more as well. So as time goes on, we will retain the strength we have in defense and aerospace but we will also gain in many new areas. As you might see in the most recent announcement we made of a smart and better vision solution using the PolarFire FPGA solution.
Hans Mosesmann: Okay. And then as a follow-up Ganesh, is there on the non-aerospace FPGA business, is there a 5G angles to that business over the next several years?
Ganesh Moorthy: There is and it's being worked on. It's I would call an emerging opportunity for where it's not the same places as some of the high performance players are playing in today but yes as 5G rolls out, there are going to be opportunities and it's on how intelligence is embedded into the edge and less into where it is in the core. And again some of the smart embedded vision solutions that type of opportunity will show up on the 5G side as well. But it's more on the Ed side not in the core network.
Hans Mosesmann: Great. Thanks again.
Operator: We'll go next to Raj Gill with Needham & Company.
Rajvindra Gill: Yes, thanks and congrats as well in a precarious environment good results. And forgive me if this question was already answered but I wanted to get a census some of the other players in the space noted the inventory correction in the China automotive market is coming to a completion and that that particular segment which had been affected pretty significantly less than the first two quarters is starting to perhaps recover. Same thing with China Industrial and again if you answered this before forgive me but just wondering if there is any thoughts there in terms of China auto and China Industrial as we go into the second half?
Eric Bjornholt: So I think automotive in China continues to have pretty significant year-over-year declines. I think what we may have seen and maybe the data you saw was in the month of June, there were stronger sales that took place in part that was driven because there was emissions change that was happening on July 1 and cars that were sold before the end of June qualified under the old requirements and then the new requirements went into being. So I don't believe that fundamentally the China automotive market has strengthened in any recent timeframe. It will obviously has more probability to bottom and go up given how far it's come down but I wouldn't say there's anything in the short term that has shown up in China automotive.
Steve Sanghi: Let me add to it, Raj you begin with talking about inventory correction in the China automotive. I don't know if that is the case. I don’t think we have seen an inventory issue in China automotive that inventory needed to be blown out. We have seen a reduction in demand driven by just duties and problems in China economy therefore lot of the luxury car manufacturers are building much, much less. So we have seen demand disruption. I don't really think there was at least from a Microchip standpoint, there was not a high inventory in China automotive.
Rajvindra Gill: Go ahead.
Steve Sanghi: With respect to your question on industrial, I think industrial weakness is not limited to just China alone. I think industrial in Europe, in the Americas, in China across the board has seen weakness. I think you've seen that in some of our competitors releases as well. Some of it has been initiated from the trade and tariffs and impact from about a year ago. But industrial remains a weak segment.
Rajvindra Gill: And this is my follow-up also a question on the silicon carbide offering. So my understanding is if you're targeting 700 volt, 1200 volt diodes and MOSFETs, I’m wondering how we think you should think about the revenue opportunity for SIC. I believe you've got the technology you heard it from Microsemi. Just wanted to get some details on kind of the history of that and how we think about the revenue stream?
Steve Sanghi: So yes the technology did come from Microsemi, it was being incubated inside Microsemi. I think what Microchip has been able to do is use our automotive strength where we have substantial market position with automotive Tier 1s and OEMs to liberate what was a technology that was starting to come into fruition inside Microsemi but didn't have as much customer access and that's what we have done over the last year, it has been able to take that technology showcase it, demonstrate it and also internally work on what does it take to be automotive ready, what does it take to be qualified for automotive and dock workers for what we could bring to the Microsemi businesses that we're working on silicon carbide.I think from a revenue standpoint this is in a market where predominantly automotive has a large demand requirements that we believe will show up in time, it is an area that requires time to win designs, ramp into production, so it's not near-term revenue but it's sowing the seeds for mid to long-term revenue.
Rajvindra Gill: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll now take a question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. A question on the direct business. Appreciate all the commentary about what Microchip has seen through distribution, I know it’s an important channel for you but hoping to better understand what you may be seeing with your direct business in terms of orders and I realize it's harder to gauge inventory levels at your direct customers but any anecdotal commentary you can provide us about how inventory may be at those direct customers? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: I would say our direct business by channel is by geography is really no different than our distribution business by geography. Europe was weak and China saw recovery from the Chinese New Year and America was somewhere in the middle. So I don't think the customers will buy from distribution have behaved any differently than the customers who buy from us direct.
Mark Delaney: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We will now take your question from William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein: Great, thanks for taking my follow-up. It’s actually similar to the last question but some companies, some semiconductor companies have specifically called out the possibility that there were customers in particular in China that may have been pulling forward demand in the fear that either well some trade friction either a tariff or a ban would influence their business going forward. Are you seeing this to any degree in your customer base, do you believe that you're able to see it or any sort of comments or update in that regard would help. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: So one thing you have to remember is that Microchip does business with a long tail of the customer, average customer is relatively small. And when they're small, they usually underfunded with very not as healthy balance sheet. So we have not really seen this pulling phenomena as much as we read and listen to other people's commentary. If you saw little bit from the larger customers, it was kind of last year. I think that has kind of run its course. Every two, three months the rules are changing. You have an equal amount of risk by bringing lot of buying it ahead and then have tariffs shortly go away. There is a settlement then you get stuck with a large amount of inventory that you have paid lower amount of tariff on that you can get it back from your customers.Let me say that one more time to explain. Let's say tariff on a given amount of product is supposed to go from 10% to 25%. To avoid that to bring in a lot of inventory at 10% tariff and then it results into a settlement with a tariff go to zero. Now the large amount of inventory you brought at a 10% tariff, you cannot recover those 10% tariff. None of your customers will pay for it because the current rules of tariffs are zero. So this is an equal risk reward game. And some people may have done push pull but I don't think it has affected our revenue at all.
William Stein: That's helpful. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: You’re welcome.
Operator: We’ll now take a question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Yes, hey thanks for taking my follow-up. Content game for opportunity is the strong driver of the business. Obviously, it's a part of the Microchip 2.0 strategy, last year you guys updated as you were driving about 20% year-over-year increase in number of Microchip products per customer program. You've got a plethora of analog interface, connectivity solutions alongside MCU, FPGAs. Are you guys still driving that type of content growth on new opportunities?
Steve Sanghi: We are, I mean I think the last time we measured was about a quarter or so ago leading up to some of the conferences we go in September, we will try to add another data point on it. I don't have the number right now but I think with all we see through the reviews, our total system solution trust with more and more of Microsemi businesses integrated with Microchips that only get stronger not weaker. So I think yes, we will be seeing that kind of content growth. But remember the base water level has gone down.So when the base water level has gone down on Microsemi business as well as Microchip business because of those uncertainty, the goodness you're getting through total system solutions is not showing up. It's very hard to measure because that should be accelerating our growth. And so far it is not because we're fighting the downturn. But the indicator looks very healthy when we look at it.
Harlan Sur: Yes, thanks for the insights.
Steve Sanghi: You’re welcome.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.
Craig Ellis: Thank you very much for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to reconcile what I thought were two comments that were in conflict a bit, so Ganesh I thought I heard you note that with respect to Microsemi synergies there were still some business systems and operational synergies benefits to be realized and that those would have economic benefit. And then Eric you noted that OpEx would be up $10 million quarter-on-quarter. So I would have expected that the synergies would offset incremental expenses.So is there just a timing issue there and then just further clarifying the OpEx point, you made Eric if OpEx is up in the quarter. Are we seeing the full benefit of whatever initiatives the management team is executing in the quarters or some follow-on effect to a subsequent quarter? Thanks guys.
Ganesh Moorthy: Craig, it is correct that we have continuing synergies coming from operations and business systems that are being combined into the Microchip systems or bringing them down from the number that were there. If you remember we started with 22 systems, 21 from what we inherited from Microsemi, one from Microchip, we're about a little more than a third of the way through bringing that down, we still have a fair number to go through in the next four quarters.And that takes time because it's not a quarter-to-quarter, you're going to get instantaneously all of that benefit that comes out, there are support costs that go into these things, there are system costs that go into these things. So on a quarter-to-quarter basis, I would not draw a conclusion that when expenses as a percentage are flat that somehow we have no longer got any more synergies coming, they will come, they will take time, they could be more in a certain quarter, it could be less in a certain quarter. Do you want to add to that, Eric?
Eric Bjornholt: Yes, I think that's absolutely right. So we’re essentially driving OpEx to be flat and percentage of sales in the current quarter and I talked a little bit in my first response to the question that we drove OpEx down very, very significantly over the last four quarters and we do have some investments that are needed to be made in the business and we're making those, we consider those modest but absolutely believe as we get some consistent revenue growth behind us that the OpEx as a percentage of sales are going to go down as we work towards our long-term target of 22.5%.And we will get some dollar savings as Ganesh was referring to as we continue to go through these business integrations over the course of the next year.
Steve Sanghi: I would add that if, yes this is Steve. If we hadn't beaten the OpEx in the last four quarters, you wouldn't see this as much of an increase but we got the OpEx synergies very aggressively early on, that has established lower mark and some of the investments we delayed and now we're having to make those investments, a number of very advanced technology tape-outs in the coming quarters. And that those tape-outs are very expensive and I think that's leading to some of the increase quarter-over-quarter. But I think the main issue is that we got the OpEx synergy much faster and not having to make some investments.
Eric Bjornholt: And it's actually about a $6 million increase quarter-on-quarter not $10 million.
Craig Ellis: Appreciate the color guys. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll now take a question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.
Harsh Kumar: Yes, hey guys. I'm surprised nobody asked this but in the September quarter Eric and Steve and Ganesh as you guys look out. Sounds like from your commentary correct me if I'm wrong FPGAs are doing really well. So I would expect that to grow better than the midpoint of 2%. But any thoughts on Microcontroller on the analog business that one will outperform the other or just kind of think about 2% kind of a growth rate on average for those?
Eric Bjornholt: We don't breakout by product line segments on our forward-looking guidance. So I would just look at the forward-looking guidance to 2% midpoint as for the company overall.
Steve Sanghi: I mean I think you trying to divide 2% breaking that really is tough.
Harsh Kumar: Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.
Operator: And it appears, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Okay. Thank you very much everybody attending this call. I think I like to reemphasize that we've been providing good guidance and managing this business through very turbulent times. We in fact started talking about these tariffs and all that before anybody else. Last year and I think our guidance has been kind of right on.We guided March quarter to be the bottom and I think we have largely delivered that without the Huawei ban we would have delivered that both on end-market demand as well as sell-in. Current quarter we're guiding up a little bit 2% up on the midpoint and we'll go from there. We'll see you at some of the conferences coming up in early September.
Eric Bjornholt: Maybe even before that. So next week we’ll be at the KeyBanc Conference, we’re at Jefferies Conference, we’re at the Citi Conference in September and in Raymond James conference. So four conferences and a couple of other investor outings this quarter.
Steve Sanghi: So heavy schedule, so we’ll see you some of you in the road. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today’s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-05-08 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Good morning, everybody. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of last evening as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2019 financial performance. And Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, provide an update on our integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the investor relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I want to remind investors that during the quarter ending, June 30, 2018, we adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition standard, which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy for revenue on such transactions were deferred until the product was sold by our distributors to an end-customer. We continue to track and measure our performance internally based on direct revenue plus distribution sell-through activity and we'll provide a metric for this called end-market demand in our earnings release each quarter. Therefore, along with our GAAP and non-GAAP results based on distribution sell-in, we will also provide investors with our end-market demand based on distribution sell-out, but will not provide a P&L on end-market demand. End-market demand in the March 2019 quarter was $1.34 billion, which was $10.4 million above our GAAP revenue. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments. Our fiscal 2019 non-GAAP results are calculated as the sum of the non-GAAP sell-through based information we disclosed previously for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, plus the non-GAAP sell-in based information disclosed today for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Net sales in the March quarter were $1.33 billion, which was above the midpoint of our guidance and down 3.3% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales and the end-market demand by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 62.2% and well above the midpoint of our guidance, which was 61.5%. Operating expenses were at the low-end of our guidance range at 25.8% of sales. And operating income was $484.1 million and 36.4% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $370.4 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.48, which was over $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance of $1.395. For fiscal 2019, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $5.476 billion and up 37.6% year-over-year. Gross margins were a record 62.1%, operating expenses were 24.3% of sales and operating income was 37.7% of sales. Net income was a record $1.636 billion and non-GAAP EPS was a record $6.55 per diluted share. Please note that for fiscal year 2019, our non-GAAP results are based on our publically reported non-GAAP results, which Q1 through Q3 as mentioned before were based on sell-through revenue recognition in the distribution channel. And Q4 was based on sell-in revenue recognition in the distribution channel. Fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP results will be based on sell-in revenue recognition, in line with our GAAP revenue reporting and the revenue recognition standard adopted during first quarter of fiscal 2019. On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.7% and include the impact of $4 million of share based compensation and $1.8 million of acquired inventory valuation cost. Total operating expenses were $535.9 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $176.9 million, special income of $23.3 million, $4.4 million of acquisition related and other costs, and share based compensation of $35.1 million. The GAAP net income was $174.7 million or $0.70 per diluted share and includes an income tax benefit of $23.5 million. The GAAP tax benefit in the quarter related to a variety of matters, including tax reserve releases due to statute of limitations expiring, tax reform refinements and tax benefits associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure. On a GAAP basis for fiscal 2019, net sales were a record $5.35 billion and up 34.4% year-over-year. Gross margins were 54.8%. Operating expenses were 41.4% of sales and operating income was 13.4% of sales. Net income was $355.9 million and EPS was $1.42 per diluted share. The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 1.4% in the March quarter and 3% for fiscal year 2019. For cash planning purposes, we were able to defer the payment of some of our fiscal 2019 taxes into fiscal 2020. And this is one of the reasons our FY 2019 tax rate was lower than originally projected. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2020 to be between 5% and 6%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits, as well as U.S. interest deductions that we believe will keep our tax cash payments low. The future cash tax payments associated with the transition tax is expected to be about $246 million and will be paid over the next 7 years. We have posted a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website. Moving on to the balance sheet, you will notice that Microchip's accounts receivable balance is up significantly from the prior quarter. We have made an accounting presentation change to reclassify the distributor price adjustments that reduce the amount of cash we ultimately receive from our distributors from a reduction in the AR balance to an increase in accrued liabilities. Remember, that we generally sell to our distributors at a price that is higher than the ultimate sales price and then that price is reduced by a distributor price adjustment when the ultimate sale occurs to the distributors' customers. Excluding this reclassification, our accounts receivable balance was up about $5 million in the quarter. Our inventory balance at March 31, 2019 was $711.7 million. All the inventory markup for Microsemi required for GAAP purchase accounting has now been sold through and is no longer reflected in the ending inventory balance. We had a 128-days of inventory at the end of the March quarter, up 5 days from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the March quarter were up 35 days compared to 36 days at the end of December. We believe that barring any negative developments in the U.S./China trade front, our distributors are holding a reasonable level of inventory to support end-market demand. The cash flow from operating activities was $403.4 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $430.9 million. We paid down $277.5 million of total debt in the March quarter. And the net debt on the balance sheet reduced by $272.3 million. At March 31, our debt outstanding includes $3.267 billion of borrowings under our line of credit, $1.912 billion of term loan B, $2 billion on high grade bonds and $4.481 billion of convertible debt. Our EBITDA in the March quarter was $544.4 million, and our trailing 12 months EBITDA was $2.212 billion. Our net debt-to-EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 4.8 at March 31, 2019. Our net leverage metrics are based on a 12-month trailing EBITDA, which will continue to provide some headwinds due to the distribution inventory reductions that were made in the June and September quarter for Microsemi, which caused our shipment activity to be significantly less than the end-market demand during these periods. The weaker economic environment also has negatively impacted our EBITDA in the December 2018 and March 2019 quarters. We are committed to using substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond our dividend payments to reduce our debt levels and we expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our dividend payment in the March quarter was $86.7 million. Capital expenditures were $40.1 million in the March 2019 quarter and $228.9 million in the fiscal year 2019. We expect about $35 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2020 to be between $130 million and $150 million. We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the outsourced to Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $48.4 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter and provide an update on some of the Microsemi integration activities. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to clarify that the product line comparisons I will be sharing with you today are based on end-market demand, which is how Microchip measures this performance internally. Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was sequentially down 4.6% compared to the December quarter, reflecting the broad macro weakness in the markets we serve. Microcontrollers, however, were up 8.6% from the year-ago quarter. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2019 microcontroller revenue was a record at over $3 billion and grew 15% over fiscal year 2018. Microcontrollers represented 53.3% of our end-market demand in the March quarter. During the quarter, we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers, ranging from the industry's first Arm-based microcontroller with space-qualified versions that have scalable levels of radiation performance; new dual- and single-core dsPIC33C Digital Signal Controllers with built-in functional safety; the industry's smallest IEEE 802.15.4-compliant module that combines an ultra-low-power microcontroller with a sub-gigahertz radio. And last but not least, we unveiled our unified 32-bit microcontroller software framework called Harmony, extending support for Atmel-originated SAM microcontrollers in Microchip's development tool environment. We now support our MIPS-based microcontrollers as well as our Arm-based microcontrollers on a single development environment of MPLAB and Harmony. Last month, Gartner released their microcontroller market share report for calendar year 2018. We're pleased to report that Microchip retained the number one position for 8-bit microcontroller. Once again, we gain market share as we grew faster than the 8-bit microcontroller market overall. And in fact, we are now 73% larger than the number two player. In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we remained in the number five position and continue to gain significant market share, as we grew faster than all our top competitors and at about 5x the growth of the 16-bit microcontroller market. In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we remained in the number six position and gain significant market share, as we grew almost at 2x the growth rate of the 32-bit market - microcontroller market. We were also the fastest growing franchise among the top six players, who make up over 80% of the 32-bit microcontroller market. These results are despite, Gartner rolling up our 32-bit microcontroller revenue to be 30% lower than the over $1 billion revenues that we informed you of in our last conference call. Had Gartner used our actual calendar year 2018, 32-bit microcontroller revenue, we would have moved up to the number four ranking. Additionally, our 32-bit microcontroller revenue in fiscal year 2019 was over $1.1 billion demonstrating continued momentum. For microcontrollers overall, we remained in the number three position and grew faster than the two players ahead of us. The Gartner reported revenue is considerably lower than our publically reported revenue for calendar year 2018. Using our publically reported revenue, we would be approximately 13% and approximately 18% away from the top two players ahead of us. As we continue our relentless march toward the number one spot. Our microcontroller portfolio and roadmap has never been stronger. We believe we have the new product momentum and the customer engagement to continue to gain even more share in 2019, as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Now moving to analog. Our analog business was sequentially down 5.8% compared to the December quarter, reflecting the same broad macro weakness our microcontroller business experienced. Analog, however, was up 60.2% from the year-ago quarter. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2019 analog revenue was a record at well over $1.5 billion, and grew 64.6% over fiscal year 2018. Analog represented 29% of our end-market demand in the March quarter. During the quarter, we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products, including a new analog to digital converter family that enables high speed, high resolution analog to digital conversions in harsh environments. Our FPGA business was sequentially down 5% as compared to the December quarter, reflecting the same broad macro weakness. However, design wins in our new low-power mid-range PolarFire family continue to grow strongly. And we are optimistic about this product family adding another leg of growth for the future. During the quarter, we introduced the PolarFire FPGA imaging and video solution that supports resolution as high as 4K in the small, low-power form factors necessary for a wide variety of imaging and video applications. We also released our Libero SoC design tool, which offers a unified suite. FPGA represented 7% of end-market demand in the March quarter. Moving next to our licensing business. This business was sequentially down 42.3% as compared to the December quarter. The production activity of our licensing customers has been cut significantly in response to industry conditions. Also as we mentioned in our February conference call, we did not expect nor have any meaningful patent licensing revenues in the March quarter, while we did in the December quarter. Our patent licensing strategy is to monetize portions of the substantial patent portfolio, we inherited through our acquisition by licensing select patents to players in non-competitive fields of use, while retaining the rights to these patents in our products as well. Investor should expect that the revenue contribution from patent licensing in the future will be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. Our memory business was sequentially up 3.8% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter. And finally, our multimarket and other business was up 3.5% sequentially as compared to the December quarter. A quick update about our Microsemi integration, as we come up on the one year anniversary after the close. Business units, sales, operations and support groups are all making good progress. Our thanks go to the combined company employees, who are working hand-in-hand to achieve accelerated synergy results. Overall, we are ahead of our synergy targets and expect continued synergy gains for many quarters to come. Business systems and operations integration is taking the longest time to complete, as we're conducting this complex transition in phases. The first and second phases were completed on November 1 and February 1, respectively for a combined total of four business units. The third phase went live on May 1 and involved four more business units. With that, we are about one-third of the way through the business systems and operations integration, and more phase releases are planned every quarter. We expect the overall business and operational integration will take about another 12 to 15 more months to complete. Finally, prior to our acquisition, Microsemi had announced the closing of the small 4-inch fab Bend, Oregon. The last wafers came out of this fab at the end of the March quarter and we ceased production on schedule. Additionally, we were able to find a buyer for the fab and closed the sale last week. The sale price was not material to Microchip. Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2020. Our March quarter GAAP and non-GAAP net sales based on sell-in revenue recognition came in just a tad above the midpoint of our guidance. The business in the quarter proceeded as we had expected. Our end-market demand measured by sell-through was about $10 million higher than the sell-in revenue. But unfortunately, we cannot call sell-through based market demand as revenue anymore based on the new revenue recognition standard. The end-market demand were stronger than sell-in revenue, which is consistent with our thesis that the channel is continuing to manage their working capital conservatively by reducing inventory due to uncertainty. Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin at 62.2% exceeded the high-end of our guidance. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 36.4% was also above the high-end of our guidance. These gross and operating margin percentages are the highest results we have ever posted at the bottom of a cycle. Our consolidated non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by over $0.08 per share. On non-GAAP basis, this was also our 114th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all employees of Microchip including employees from all of our acquisitions for their contribution. One other area I wanted to point out is our debt payments. In the March quarter, we paid down $277.5 million of our debt. Our total debt payment since the end of June 2018 has been $1.156 billion. With expected $250 million payment in the June quarter, we expect to have paid down about $1.4 billion of our debt since the closing of the Microsemi transaction on May 29, 2018, which we feel is excellent progress. In addition, with Federal Reserve Board expected to be on hold for any further interest rate increases, we're optimistic that the peak of our debt-to-EBITDA leverage is behind us and we should see meaningful reduction in leverage in the next one year starting this June quarter. Now, I will provide you guidance for the June quarter. The guidance we provided for the September quarter of last year, which reflected our caution on business conditions, turned out in retrospect to be spot on and was a harbinger for broader industry weakness through the last several quarters. In our last quarter earnings call, we said that barring any negative development on the trade front, we see the March 2019 quarter to mark the bottom of this cycle for Microchip. Secondly, we said that last quarter we did not know the shape of the recovery, whether it is V, U or L shaped. And it would depend somewhat on the outcome of the trade talks. Towards that end, we did not get a settlement on the trade front. In fact, in recent days, the rhetoric has turned more negative with 25% duties on $200 billion of Chinese goods expected to go into effect this Friday. Therefore, the uncertainty related to U.S. China trade relations continues. Given this continued uncertainty, we see weaker than seasonal business conditions for Microchip. We continue to operate our business prudently for long-term shareholder value and we believe that the end-market demand will continue to be stronger than the GAAP sell-in revenue in the June quarter, and the channel and customer inventory will continue to decrease. Given this color about business conditions, we expect net sales for our products to be about flat sequentially plus or minus 5% in the June 2019 quarter. We want to correct some of the analysts' and investors perception about what is the seasonal growth for us in the June quarter. If you take our past year's revenue as it reported and average them for a calculation of the June quarter seasonality, you will get a very wrong result, it is because several of our acquisitions closed in April. Supertex acquisition closed on April 1, 2014. Atmel acquisition closed on April 3, 2016. And Microsemi acquisition closed on May 29, 2018. If we make the calculation based on moving the acquired company sales in the first quarter then based on the last seven years at average net sales in the June quarter were up about 3% sequentially. Therefore, our current flattish guidance at the midpoint for June quarter is below historical seasonality for classic Microchip. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61.8% and 62.2% of sales, we expect the non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 25.3% and 26.3% of sales. We expect the non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 35.5% and 36.9% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.26 per share to $1.49 per share. Now the next question is what happens after the June quarter. The hints coming out of Washington regarding the status of U.S. China trade talks continue to oscillate between positive and negative. While there is no guarantee that talks will end successfully with the settlement, we believe that any finality of such talks will remove some of the uncertainty and will have positive effect on the business. China has already taken a number of stimulus measures to boost business including a cut in the VAT from 16% to 13%, cutting the personal income tax rate and cutting reserve requirements of the banks thus increasing the money supply. We have seen some strength in our China business from the bottom in the March quarter and expect more strength to pick-up in the second half of calendar 2019. The automotive business continues to be weak around the world, because of car production down in U.S., Europe and China. We expect that our automotive business, bottomed in March quarter, too, and should start to recover from the low base and strengthen into the second half of calendar 2019. Considering all of the above factors, we are renewing our belief that barring any negative developments on the trade front, we will expect the business recovery to pick-up in the second half of calendar 2019. Given all the complications of accounting for acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis, except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: Of course, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay. We will now take our first question from John Pitzer from Crédit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yeah, good morning, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Steve, my first question, very helpful to - help us understand how you're viewing seasonality into the June quarter, but just given all the acquisition, and I think a couple of quarters ago you talked about still trying to understand the seasonality of all the new businesses together. I'm wondering if you could just level set everyone on the call and help us understand how you think about seasonality in September, December, in March as well as June?
Steve Sanghi: John, we're not able to give forward-looking seasonality for multiple quarters yet. We haven't had enough experience on the Microsemi front. Some of the last year's performance was affected by the inventory reduction we undertook in distribution. So we haven't had number of normal quarters. Then we got hit by all these U.S./China trade issues for the last couple of quarters that we have been fighting and are now looking for the recovery. So the historic seasonality for June quarter I mentioned was to remove the acquired company's first quarter revenue and then average the last 7 years. We certainly can do that for the September and December quarter, and provide that information to the investors, but that would be backward-looking seasonality. We are not yet able to give you information on the forward-looking seasonality.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then just as my follow-up, on the CapEx guidance for the new fiscal year, it's down fairly meaningfully year-over-year. To what extent is that just a reflection of the weak business environment? Or is this just really some of the CapEx projects you had in place to help integrate the acquisitions are mostly behind you? And how do we think about kind of the run-rate of CapEx, whether as a percent of sales or an absolute dollar number from kind of what you're projecting for the current fiscal year?
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. This is Eric. I can take that question. So as indicated, we're projecting somewhere between $130 million and $150 million in CapEx for fiscal 2020. That's down from about $230 million in fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 we have some kind of onetime events associated with some building projects that we talked about at the last few conference calls that was in the $60 million to $70 million range. And we have put capacity in place in the first half of last fiscal year, expecting the environment to be stronger. So I think we're pretty well positioned. And then we also have a full year of Microsemi, couple of months in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. So all that combined, I think our CapEx projection is reasonable range for the current year. I think over the course of time, we'll be in that 3% to 4% of sales and there will be peaks and valleys to that just based on the environment that we're facing at that time.
John Pitzer: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Chris Danely from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Christopher Danely: Hey, thanks, guys. So, Steve, your tone seems a little more pessimistic than it did three months ago. So has anything changed? Is this just because we're looking at another $200 billion? Has anything changed in your business over the last week or the last, I guess, three months since you're last on the call to make you little more pessimistic on how things are going?
Steve Sanghi: Well, what changed is really the tone on the U.S./China trade front, going from lot of positive signals coming from various officials, including Secretary Mnuchin and all that over the last couple of months. And then, turning into a tweet by President Trump on Sunday that the 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods are going into effect this Friday, resulting into cancellation of the visit by Vice Premier of China first and then later on he put back the visit and he is now arriving on Thursday. So the rhetoric has turned meaningfully negative here and causing significant uncertainty. Now, there hasn't been a lot of time since that news to gauge the reaction of our distributors and customers. And as you know, we have very broad distribution and thousands and thousands of customers. And in couple of days you cannot really gauge all that. So, yes, our tone has turned distinctly negative due to those developments.
Christopher Danely: Sure. I guess, if this wasn't going on, maybe last week or the week before, what would your guide just be and what have you heard from customers kind of as the quarter has progressed on the their tone of business?
Steve Sanghi: I think that's kind of would I, should I, could I, we don't know. But certainly, our guidance would have been much more narrower in the range versus a wide range. And the guidance would have been more positive on the midpoint than the one we have provided now.
Christopher Danely: Okay. Thanks, Steve.
Ganesh Moorthy: Chris, I would add also, the trade resolution has also been delayed. So not only the most recent news from the weekend, when we were speaking to everybody back in February, there was a much earlier date for resolution. So that continues to push out and create uncertainty as well.
Steve Sanghi: During our conference call last quarter, which I think was on February 9 or something, the trade resolution was supposed to happen prior to March 1. So it was relatively imminent. Then it was delayed to May 1 and then it didn't happen on May 1. And then the events turned negative. So there has been a substantial delay and change on that front.
Christopher Danely: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Morning. Thank you for taking my question. Last year Analyst Day which was held in early March of last year, you guys were able to accurately call out the trends for the June quarter and even provide June quarter sequential growth outlook. And I think a big part of the analysis back then was the rate of backlog built for the June quarter post Chinese New Year, so which in a normalized environment kind of flattens out during CNY and then rises post Chinese New Year. So, I guess, the question is what seems like you didn't see this type of recovery in the backlog this year. So maybe if you could just provide us with some color here on the backlog trends, post-CNY this year? And what are the current backlog trends telling you about the September quarter?
Steve Sanghi: So I think the environment is of significant uncertainty, because of U.S./China trade talks this year than it was last year, there was no such uncertainty. The only uncertainty we were dealing with last year was investor's perception about the letters we had written a year before, which many investors felt that pulls demand up and there will be a correction. And I think we showed through the charts that there was no such effect of the letters we write. Those letters are simply to inform our customers' broad base of 120,000 plus customers, the environment we were dealing with. And through backlog in turns and various metrics we show to the investors that our business was in good shape and we were not really seeing any challenges. The environment today with uncertainty with the two largest markets we have, which are the U.S. and China, together they make close to 50% of our business, if not more, is of significant more uncertainty. And simply looking at the backlog in turns and all that in the middle of the quarter cannot make up for large amount of customer sentiment. So having said all that, our backlog on April 1 started lower than our backlog was on January 1, because last quarter bookings were weak. So our backlog started lower. However, the bookings quarter to date in this quarter for the month of April and few days in May has been stronger than the bookings we got at the - during the same time last quarter from January 1 to February timeframe. So the bookings are stronger. And the turns coming from those bookings are stronger, because the lead-times are short. But with significant change in the sentiment, driven by just the events of last few days, it's very difficult to project what the distributor and customer sentiment would be in the balance of the quarter. Just imagine if you were a supplier and you didn't know whether you will be able to pass on a 25% tariff increase to your customers, whether your customer will then choose to buy that product from Korea, Taiwan or somewhere else and that's from the Chinese supplier. In that environment, you would take actions to protect your business by not having large amount of inventory only building to form orders and negotiating with your customers, what kind of price increase you can pass on. Those are all uncertainties of thousands and thousands of customers have been dealing with for quite a while impacting our business.
Eric Bjornholt: I think, one of the thing I would add to what Steve said is, comparing the sentiment at March 1 last year when we did our Analyst Day to today, the other significant change over that time period is lead times have contracted significantly. And so that gives customers flexibility to place very short-term orders on us and to be responsive, which wasn't necessarily the case over a year ago back in March.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thanks for the insights there. My follow-up question is strong showing on the market share front in MCUs for 2018. On 32-bit, you guys do your business almost 900 basis points, faster than in the overall market. And I don't think, Microsemi had any 32-bit MCUs, so pretty much all organic, you've got your MIPS architecture, you've got your ARM family. You guys could just help us understand the drivers of the strong outperformance. I assume maybe part of it is helping your customers move up stack. But what are some of the other dynamics driving the strong market share performance?
Ganesh Moorthy: So it is not completely correct, that Microsemi had no 32-bit microcontroller. They did have a class of what we call specialized microcontrollers, which are 32-bit microcontrollers. But in general, the classic Microchip 32-bit products of both architectures, MIPS and ARM, have been doing extremely well. As you know, we acquired the ARM microcontrollers through the Atmel acquisition, so that is given us the ability to serve a broader set of customers, a broader set of applications. And so that combination of both what classic Microchip could do with the 32-bit microcontrollers we have, that a more general purpose, plus some of the specialized microcontrollers that come through Microsemi, all contributed to the last 12 months or the calendar year 2018 growth numbers that you see.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Rajvindra Gill from Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Rajvindra Gill: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Yes, just to follow-up on the China trade issue, I'm trying to get a sense in terms of how the issues with trade, how it translates into actual orders on the ground. A lot of the companies in the coverage, that you saw kind of an abrupt cut in orders from their customers in China starting in December different from kind of past cycles and then have been starting to see some rebound, and given kind of your guidance in June reflecting kind of weaker seasonal trends even though the comment from Trump came out on Sunday. I'm just trying to reconcile your guidance and the short nature of the change in sentiment, because this only happened last week, and the actual impact that you're seeing on the ground to give you - to give way to give the guidance in the first place.
Steve Sanghi: Hi, Rajiv. It's very, very difficult to accurately assess the impact of the substantial negative turn on the developments of trade talks. That's why we have a fairly broad guidance not being accurately able to model the impact. These are not the issues where there is a - historic record of what happens, and then these kind of things haven't happened in history, so only in the last couple of quarters. And I think, we predicted the downturn better than anybody in the industry, we were the first one to predict that. And many of the earnings report, this season came before the Trump's tweet on Sunday citing the talks have turned negative. So having that knowledge that these talks have returned negative, in our announcement last night in our earnings, we have to put the possibility of negative customer behavior. One thing I have described before to analysts and investors in various calls and meetings. The world economy largely runs on people building to forecast. Every manufacturer builds large amount of their products on forecast form electronic stores to grocery stores to furniture stores. You go to a store and grocery store is full of grocery and you put it in the bags and you go home. If the manufacturers did not put the grocery store inventory, you would go there and just place your order and come back in two days to pick it up. So in an uncertain environment, when the - when our customers, I'm not able to figure out the demand for the products, because they do not know, whether they will be able to pass it 25% tariff to their end customers. In their environment, they stop a building to a forecast, and they largely want to build to hard orders, where they can negotiate the price increase. And that is happening with our industrial customers, with our consumer customers, housing appliance customers. You have heard where prices for washers and dryers and others have gone up 20%. So in that environment, the ecosystems squeezes down the inventory from end customer inventory to loading docks to intermediate hubs to stores to everywhere else. And that creates a negative impact on our ability to supply chips, which then eventually going to products. And you have seen that phenomena experienced by every other semiconductor manufacturer whose revenue has fallen in the last six, nine months, where back in August, nobody was confirming that there's a problem, when we said there was a problem. Does that make sense, Rajiv?
Rajvindra Gill: Hello?
Steve Sanghi: Yes.
Rajvindra Gill: Yeah. I think that makes sense. It's a moving target, I just read that now, that Trump said, the Chinese Vice Premier is coming to the U.S. to quote make a deal. So I guess, it's a constant change. But I appreciate. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I know, we're trying to get the best sense for June, and I understand and appreciate that it's a moving target. So the conservatism is justified. My first question is that in just in terms of what you have actually seen so far in terms of bookings from your customers in China or U.S. or Europe. Is it fair to say that any of these concerns about trade have not yet reflected in those bookings so far? But have you seen any trend, I realize that we are just within a week of all these political development. But so far, is it fair to say that you've not really seen any negative development in bookings from any geography or end-market or anything along those lines?
Steve Sanghi: So Vivek, you have to first decide from what timeframe you're comparing. If you're simply comparing it to what we talked last Friday, yes, we have not seen an impact in the last two days, because it's just too hard to gauge. But if your timeframe is February 9, our last call, then we have seen the impact. At that time, the trade settlement was supposed to happen prior to March 1 then it got delayed to May 1, and we didn't - then we didn't see it on May 1 either. So all the time, we have seen the impact on bookings and customers' ability to want to build the appropriate amount of inventory for the business from the endpoint inventories to loading docks to hubs to everything else. If your reference point is our last earnings call, yes, the business is weaker than what it could have been, if there was a settlement on March 1.
Vivek Arya: Got it. I asked that Steve, just because I think your March numbers were actually fine, and I think, what you mentioned was that so far in June. The bookings have also been fine. But let me leave that aside for a second. On Microsemi, could you remind us how much earnings accretion you finally saw now that fiscal 2019 is over? And how much earnings accretion, we should be thinking about from a fiscal 2020 perspective? Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So we have not broken out in the current quarter, what - the quarter we're just reporting what the Microsemi contribution was. We are definitely ahead of schedule. We had mentioned last quarter that we had achieved kind of one-year target of run rate of 75% accretion. We were above that as the end of December. And that things are continuing to progress, we're taking cost out of the system. Ganesh gave commentary in terms of how we're doing on business units and sales and support groups from an integration perspective, so making good progress. We still feel good about our long-term synergy numbers and are working towards that. But we haven't broken out and aren't breaking out at this point in time, that specific accretion that we've achieved so far.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from William Stein from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First, the company posted some better-than-expected results on the gross margin line. Can you help us understand whether that's attributed more to mix or cost savings from Microsemi or anything else? And then I have a follow-up, please.
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So I'll take that. So we exceeded the midpoint of our non-GAAP gross margin guidance by about 70 basis points. The very strong gross margins were driven by a variety of reasons, including favorable product mix and ongoing cost reduction. So it always is a mix of things. There's a lot of moving parts, margin, but we're making good progress on integration and the product mix was favorable in the quarter also to help us with that. And even at the midpoint of our guidance on the current quarter at 62%, we're only really 1% away from our long-term target of 63%. So I think things have really held up well in this downturn. Yes, our inventory situation is a little bit higher than our target, but with short lead times and customers and distributors been in the pattern of decreasing their inventory levels. It gives us the visibility to respond very proactively to their needs.
Steve Sanghi: I would reemphasize one point that I made in my prepared remarks that as we go through various cycles, you can look at in the last 20 years. This would be the highest growth in operating margin nearly at the bottom of the cycle. In the past, you will see this kind of growth in operating margin usually on the top of the cycle. So this is how much we have improved creating higher highs and higher lows. So as we go further in the next couple of years, complete this integration, have better loading in the factories with the demand coming back. It's really a good feeling to think about where the growth in operating margins could go.
William Stein: I appreciate those comments. One follow-up, if I can. Turning to the Microsemi acquisition, less about the integration, but more about the inventory, I understand from the prepared remarks that you've worked through all of the Microsemi inventory that was on your balance sheet. I was hoping you could comment on inventory, not only in the channel, but in any other places like at customers to the degree you can see it. Is that work down to more normal levels where this is less of a deterrent to grow going forward? Or is there still some inventory in channel or at customers to work down? Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: Yeah. So I think, we've done a good job of working through the issues that we've identified early on in the acquisition. The Microsemi distribution inventory, take you back to the September quarter. It was reduced to about 2.6 months over the course of the first four months of holding the assets, and the shipment activity into this distribution was impacted dramatically by that. But that has stayed very constant, that 2.6 months has stayed the same and the December quarter and the March quarter. So we think, we've got a good balance there. There can be a business unit or two that adds a little bit of elevated inventory, and just taking some time to leave that down? But overall, I think, we are in good position. And the other things, that we had talked about was contracts, manufacturing inventory; and things like that. And I think all those have been corrected at this point in time. Steve or Ganesh might have some additional comments.
Ganesh Moorthy: The only comment I'll make is, I think, in terms of end customers, we really don't get inventory reports. So we don't think there's a big overhang there. But we don't have much visibility into it. Our own inventory internally, we're continuing to work down. So this is our production areas and we have been running lower than what the sell-through as in terms of what we're building, and that is slowly coming back into levels that should be, but it's not completely where it needs to be.
William Stein: Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: And we did take a under capacity utilization charge in the quarter overall for various factories of a little over $7 million in the last quarter.
Steve Sanghi: And as the demand comes back, and when that $7 million charge goes away, that $7 million ends up in the gross margin.
William Stein: Yeah. Excellent.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Craig Ellis from B. Riley FBR, Inc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Craig Ellis: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I'll start with clarification on two operating items. First, debt reduction came in much better than expected at least on my front, and the outlook suggests that the improvement that the company saw versus expectations is structural. So I wanted to get some clarification on that, and further on the comments that Ganesh had in his prepared remarks, where he outlined three milestones that have been achieved with business integration. The clarification there is, is the financial benefit fairly linear with the milestones achieved, so that we're about one-third of the way through the financial benefit? Or is it front-end loaded or back-end loaded?
Eric Bjornholt: So Craig, just to clarify, you had started off with - it's an OpEx question, right?
Craig Ellis: The first one is debt reduction. And the $277 million, I thought that was above the expectation of the company. What's the cause of the positive variance?
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. All right. So we continue to really manage our working capital requirements quite tightly, and had a good execution there, and just managing our overall cash balances worldwide. So we've outperformed on debt pay down, no doubt about that, over the last couple of quarters and made good progress. I've mentioned that our debt-to-EBITDA is still 4.8 and we expect as we progress in the second half of 2019. And the EBITDA improves, and we're going to continue to be using all of our excess cash generation to pay down debt that we will see some significant improvements in our debt-to-EBITDA. So I think, it's the working capital management, we talked about CapEx a little bit earlier, also CapEx being down significantly in fiscal 2020 as a projected number compared to fiscal 2019 will also help on the cash flow and we should expect to see debt come down significantly over the course of the next 12 months.
Ganesh Moorthy: To your second question on the business and operations integration. It's on a longer-term basis, it's more linear, but quarter-to-quarter, we're going to see more or less effects depending on are we able to retire some of the prior ERP systems completely or not. And so it's not entirely linear looking at the quarter-to-quarter.
Craig Ellis: Thank you. And then the follow-up is for Steve. Steve, you given us a very clear picture of the dynamic that you're seeing now and the way recent political developments are impacting, you're thinking. What I wanted to do is, is reconcile that with comments that I thought, I heard you say that there could be a pickup in the back half of the year. Is that potential pickup more predicated on a favorable set of developments that could happen on the macro front? Or is it closer proximity to typical enterprise and consumer bills that would take place in the back half of the year or something else? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: I think there are two possibilities on the trade front, actually three. One, the worse would be that trade talks break and there is 25% duty, not only on the $200 billion of goods, but another $325 billion of goods that are threatened. That will be the worst-case scenario. But the other possibilities are there is some very good settlement, where whatever the issues are between the two countries on IP theft and forced transfers of technology, and all those things, there is a system put in place to monitor all these and issues are resolved and tariffs come down. That would be the best-case scenario. And the other one is that there is some sort of finality, but it's not as good as U.S. wants. As long as there is a finality on the settlement, where the people know what the rules are, then the manufacturers can adjust to those rules and can negotiate with their customers to pass the additional cost, whether it's 5%, 10% duty cost, as long as there is a finality, I think will be positive for the business. Of course, it will be extremely positive if there is a settlement and duties go away, and there is a very good environment. But even if it is not the ultimate best, but there is some sort of finality, I think they would be better than the uncertainty we're dealing with.
Craig Ellis: That's very helpful. Thanks, gentlemen.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Harsh Kumar from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Harsh Kumar: Yeah, hey, guys. First of all, we appreciate your position, trying to guide in all this seesaw trade chatter and running the company prudently for the long-term. Steve, now, you're taking share for quite a bit of time in what is a mature 8-bit market. What do you think are some of the things that Microchip specifically is doing that is helping you take share in that market?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I don't really want to tell my competitors how I'm taking shares. I would simply say that if somebody doesn't develop any more 8-bits parts and adds no innovation to them, simply because that by a thesis that 8-bit market is not growing and put all their energy in the 32-bit, then they will continuously become more and more uncompetitive in the 8-bit and will continue to gain share, which is really what's happening. There are many more things we're doing, but we are continuously able to show 8-bit customers how they can keep on utilizing our newer and newer 8-bit microcontrollers and continue to add innovation and not having to go to 16 or 32-bit microcontrollers. And therefore, we've taken a lot of share.
Harsh Kumar: Fair enough, Steve, thanks for that color. And then, I wanted to ask about - you cited some bookings data and some order data, all of it seems to be improving, the back-half commentary is improving. Would it be fair for me to assume that, that you basically haircut it what you might - let's say, you were doing earnings last week, you might have had a completely different commentary, completely different set guide. You simply haircut it that based on the developments this week, is that a fair assumption?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, that's a fair assumption.
Harsh Kumar: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now move on to our next question from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay. Thank you for taking my question. Steve, you mentioned the automotive market. You thought that that had hit a bottom and is coming back. Can you give a little more details around that? And, also just maybe what your content increases might be for this year?
Ganesh Moorthy: So I think the way to think about it is not that it is rebounding into this quarter. I think we said it's hitting bottom and it is heading to where as we look into the second half, things are getting better. The content increases, a constant effort that we drive. We have shown you some of the slides in investor forums where we have 60, 70, 80 different components. And that continues to take place. And various carmakers may not be for the same design in every carmaker. But it is a part of how we drive the market. It is a part how the market is evolving. There is more and more electronics that is going into safety, into convenience, into some of these new electric and electrification and ADAS, those types of trends. And we have our fair share in all of those areas. And I think the last piece is the European WLTP regulational change, I think the last remnants of that will cleared into the - by the end of this quarter. It has taken longer to clear. But believe that all that clears as we go through the end of this quarter. So those are all the different factors going into some of the color that Steve provided.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay, maybe just as a follow-up, that China VAT tax, have you seen a more positive bookings from the Chinese automotive companies?
Ganesh Moorthy: We haven't really broken down to Chinese automotive specifically. I think if you look at China overall, we are seeing stronger bookings. And there should be a part of that reflected in most of the other areas, markets that are in China.
Steve Sanghi: The lower VAT went into effect I think on April 1, so just like in U.S., when tax law changes or sales tax changes in a city or a state or some of those rule change or interest rate changes. I mean, it takes a while to affect the economy. And I don't know if that's enough time for us to measure that a Chinese customer changed their orders based on the VAT. I think that takes longer term to take hold in the economy. We're going to get orders from Chinese customers based on them having orders from their customers to build modules, build cars or whatever. And that's not likely to change in four weeks of VAT changing.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First question was on operating expenses, which was pointed out, came in at the low-end or just below guidance. Can you help us better understand to what extent those structural cost takeouts that helped the better performance on cost or more timing or other temporal factors?
Eric Bjornholt: All right, so, I mean, we've done what I consider to be a very good job in managing OpEx over the last several quarters. We've essentially beat significantly on OpEx on both September and December and came in at the low-end of guidance here in the current quarter. So we're managing the operations very tightly, given the environment that we're facing. And as the environment improves in second half, if it improves, we will have investments to make in the business that will have those dollars go up. So we're holding OpEx flat at the midpoint of guidance in the current quarter. And that's pretty tight controlled, and again, would expect that OpEx will increase over time as we need to invest in the business to drive the long-term health at 40% plus operating margin goals that we have.
Mark Delaney: Okay. It's helpful. And there's a lot of discussion on the call about the distribution business. So I was hoping maybe to pivot a little bit and better understand some of the trends in the direct business that came over from Microsemi acquisition. I believe servers and storage were markets that were served on an OEM direct basis. Help us understand how bookings and market share is trending in those areas and I think cross-selling the full portfolio was part of the strategy. How successful has that been? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: So there is weakness in some of those markets as you have seen reported by other players as well. I don't think there is anything particular about bookings that would give us any insight there. In terms of the cross-selling, those customers have given us access for other solutions that classic Microchip had. And we're having good progress in discussions on how those can be incorporated into next generation designs using Microchip classic solutions that surround some of the storage and other networking solutions that Microsemi brought. So the customer access has been extremely useful to take solutions that are necessary in the market. But we did not have as good customer access as Microchip standalone.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. We will now move on to our next question. It comes from Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna International Group.
Christopher Rolland: Susquehanna. Yeah, one for Eric and then - and one for Steve. I guess, Eric, the $7 million in underutilization, is there a level of company utilizations which you deem underutilized? And then also, if you could talk about where utilizations are now and your inventory levels and if you have plans to bring them down. Thanks.
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So really the underutilization is looked at on a factory-by-factory basis, based on kind of the historical norm. So there isn't kind of a one-size-fits-all for that. And we've got our three large fabs, three large assembly and tests that Microchip classic has had historically, and then a bunch of smaller factories that have come through the Microsemi acquisition. So it's kind of a case-by-case scenario that we look at that. And we don't break out a specific capacity utilization percentage. We just haven't done that historically. But we've got lots of capacity in place, and so we're well poised to be able to respond to growth as it comes in the future with pretty low CapEx. So that's a good thing. The piece of your question was what?
Christopher Rolland: Was internal inventories, and do you have guys have a plan to work that down? And how do you feel about that level?
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So inventory was up 5 days in the quarter to 128. We've kind of had a target of 115 to 120 that we talked about. And so, inventory is on the higher end. But I think it is prudent for us to hold that level of inventory, given the fact that the distribution inventory has come down and customers are managing their own inventory quite conservatively, we believe, again, we don't give real-time reports from them. So it allows us to report quickly in this uncertain environment, where customers are needing to respond quickly when they get demand, because they're not building to forecast as Steve kind of described before. So longer term, our goal would be to get the inventory down to 120 days or less. But that's not the environment that we're facing right now.
Ganesh Moorthy: A little extra inventory at this part of the cycle also prevents CapEx expenses on the other side of the cycle. So these are products with very long life. There is a little to no obsolescence risk. And it does help from an overall cycle standpoint to have some inventory investment that can then defray CapEx spending on the other side of the cycle.
Steve Sanghi: I would say also that our inventory is a lot lower than some of the large other analog players' inventory I have heard about. So while our target is 115 to 120, you would expect that this part of the cycle, when you're at the near bottom of the cycle, the inventory to be higher than the high-end of that. And yet I think I'm - when I compare it our inventory is lower than a lot of other players.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yeah, many have 150ish.
Steve Sanghi: Yeah.
Christopher Rolland: Yeah, that is fair. And then, Steve, for you, if a trade deal was reached, would you still view kind of the return of business as a potential bonanza or are you more tempered here? So is there something that makes you more tempered? Just as these negotiations, it seems like, even if we think something is finalized, but they may not be.
Steve Sanghi: I think having seen the yo-yo sentiment on the trade talks, I would rather wait for the talks to conclude, then analyze what that finality is, whether it ends up at 10% duty or something higher than that or goes all the way to 0%, and have a chance to understand our customers' and distributors' reaction through our sales people and talking to some directly to really make an informed opinion rather than just throw something out.
Christopher Rolland: Yeah, that's fair. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Craig Hettenbach: Thanks. I understand all the focus on China in terms of what's happening from a macro. But was hoping, Steve, you can talk about trends that you're seeing in Europe and the United States as well.
Steve Sanghi: Well, trends in U.S. and Europe are really not that great either. Lot of our U.S. customers are impacted because of the same trade issues. Industrial customers build a lot of their products in China and are having to pay the tariff cost, which are currently 10% going to 25%. So our industrial business in U.S. is impacted. Our consumer business, which is in the consumer appliance area, is impacted. The automotive business is impacted not because of tariffs, but I think the automotive in general. Automotive production is down in all three geographies.
Ganesh Moorthy: But China is weak too. And China was a big export for European automotive.
Steve Sanghi: Yes, so go ahead, comment on Europe. I was going to go there.
Ganesh Moorthy: So I think Europe is seeing some of those headwinds that are - none of these are confined to just one geography. There is interconnection between how global economy is played. And so, for example, on the European carmakers, especially the luxury car makers, they've had significant declines, because the China market has been very weak for them. And that ripples through into some of the lower, in recent times, lower GDPs coming through some of the European economies. And many of them like Germany are highly export oriented and affected by any impact in other regions of the world. And so, there is a continuous uncertainty and weakness that expands beyond just China and the U.S., but in part driven by what's happening in these economies.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. And just a follow-up question on the commentary of inventory, the expectation that you think it will be drawn down again in the June quarter. Do you think that the customers or distributors will be reaching kind of limits of how far they will take it down? Or if things remained uncertain directionally, you think it would still go lower in terms of their inventory management?
Steve Sanghi: I think distributors will assess what the sales-out is and if the sales out is decreasing because of whatever, then they will continue to draw down inventory. If they expect that sales out is increasing then they would start to build inventories to serve that sales-out. So it's not that the inventory is changing that much in months of inventory. It's mostly multiple of really what their expectation of sales-out is. And many of the Chinese distributors, their sales out has been much lower in December and March quarters, lot of it driven by trade issues, because their end-customers couldn't sell the product given the duties.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. I appreciate your color.
Operator: Thank you. As there are no further questions at this time, I would like to hand the call back over to you, Mr. Sanghi, for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Well, we want to thank you. There was a very large participation on this call compared to what we have had in the last several quarters. We've got lots of very, very good questions from investors and analysts. And thank you for giving us a chance to explain our views on U.S./China trade, where the things are, how the business is. And we'll see some of you as we get on the road to various conferences this quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-02-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip's Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
James Bjornholt: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2019 financial performance and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on our integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I want to remind investors that during the quarter ending June 30, 2018, we adopted a new GAAP revenue recognition standard, which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy where revenue on such transactions were deferred until the product was sold by our distributors to an end customer. We recently went through a comment letter process with the SEC regarding our non-GAAP reporting. As a result of this process, we will now be referring to what we used to call non-GAAP revenue as a metric called end-market demand and we'll provide this metric in our earnings release each quarter. End-market demand is the net dollar amount of our products, licensing revenue and other services delivered to our direct customers to non-distributors and buyer distributors to their customers. We are able to calculate end-market demand by our distributors based on information that our distributors provide to us about their product shipments to their customers and inventory holdings. The value of end-market demand from our distributors is calculated as the net of transaction value of these shipments. We will continue to manage our business and distributor relationships based on creating and fulfilling end-market demand. All of Microchip's bonus programs will continue to work based on end-market demand. Therefore, along with our GAAP and non-GAAP results based on distribution sell-in, we will also provide investors with our end-market demand based on distribution sell out but will not provide a P&L based on end-market demand. So even though we are changing our guidance practice going forward, for transition purposes, today, we will provide a review of our Q3 results compared to our non-GAAP guidance provided on November 7, 2018, using our historical non-GAAP nomenclature. Our guidance going forward will reflect the outcome of the SEC comment letter process, which Steve will also comment on during his remarks about our guidance for the March 2019 quarter. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis using end-market demand metric as expenses and expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. End-market demand in the December quarter was $1.416 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance, which was $1.4 billion, and down 6.4% sequentially from end-market demand of $1.513 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our end-market demand and GAAP net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 62.2%, operating expenses were 24.8% of end-market demand and operating income was $530 million and 37.4% of end-market demand. Non-GAAP net income was $405.6 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.66 and was $0.095 above the midpoint of our guidance of $1.565. On a GAAP basis, net sales in the December quarter were $1.375 billion, GAAP gross margins were 56.7% and include the impact of $3.4 million of share-based compensation, $74.3 million of acquired inventory valuation cost and $23.8 million impact from the differences in GAAP revenue and end-market demand. All operating expenses were $584.9 million and include acquisition and intangible amortization of $193.7 million, special income of $1.3 million, $5.4 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $36 million. The GAAP net income was $49.2 million or $0.20 per diluted share and includes onetime tax expense of $0.4 million related to a variety of matters, including tax reserve releases due to audit settlements, statute limitations expiring, tax reform and transition tax refinement and fiscal 2018 tax provision to tax return adjustments. The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 3.5% in the December quarter and we expect a similar rate for all of fiscal year 2019. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '20 and fiscal '21 to be 5% or less, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with the restructuring of the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as U.S. interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The cash tax payments associated with the transition tax for the combined Microchip-Microsemi group is expected to be about $293 million and will be paid over eight years. We have a posted schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website. For GAAP purposes, we had a significant tax benefit in the current quarter for a variety of reasons discussed earlier. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at December 31, 2018 was $702.5 million. All of the inventory markup from Microsemi required for GAAP post-accounting has now been sold through and is no longer reflected in the ending inventory balance. We had 123 days of inventory at the end of December quarter, up six days from the prior quarter's levels. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were 36 days compared to 37 days at the end of September. We believe that our distributors are holding an appropriate level of inventory to support end-market demand. The cash flow from operating activities was $481.5 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $436.2 million. We paid down $377.5 million of total debt in the December quarter and the net debt on the balance sheet reduced by $349.4 million. At December 31, our debt outstanding includes $2.743 billion of borrowings under our line of credit, $2.713 billion of term loan B, $2 billion on high grade bonds and $4.481 billion of convertible debt. Our net debt-to-EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 4.8 at December 31. Our net leverage metrics are based on a 12-month trailing EBITDA which will continue to provide some headwinds due to significant distribution inventory reductions that were made in the June and September quarter for Microsemi, which caused our shipment activity to be significantly less than end-market demand during these periods. The weak economic environment also has negatively impacted our EBITDA in the December 2018 quarter and will continue to do so in the March 2019 quarter. We are committed to using substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond our dividend payments to reduce our debt levels and we expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our dividend payment in the December quarter was $86.3 million. Capital expenditures were $27.4 million in the December quarter. We expect about $45 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 to be about $235 million. We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the outsourced to Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $47 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter and provide an update on some of the Microsemi integration activities. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to clarify that the product line comparisons I would be sharing with you are based on an end-market demand metric, which is how Microchip measures this performance internally. Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was sequentially down 8.7% compared to the September quarter, reflecting a broad macro weakness in the markets we serve. Microcontrollers, however, were up 13.2% from the year-ago quarter. Microcontrollers represented 52.9% of our revenue in the December quarter. During the quarter, we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers, ranging from the industry's lowest power LoRa System-in-Package family; the single-chip maXTouch touchscreen controllers for screens up to 20 inches in size; to Intelligent Network Interface Controller technology, the industry's most efficient automotive infotainment networking solution that supports all data types, including audio, video, control and Ethernet over a single cable. In my prepared remark last quarter, I mentioned that our microcontroller business was annualizing at over $3 billion in end-market revenue. Through our subsequent investor meetings, there seemed to be the perception that our 32-bit microcontroller business was not very big. To address this perception gap, we'd like to share with you that over the last two quarters, our 32-bit microcontroller business is annualizing at over $1.2 billion in end-market revenue. The 2018 microcontroller rankings from Gartner are normally available in April and, as we have seen in prior years' results, we expect to see significant market share gains again. We will report on these results during our next conference call. Now moving to analog. Our analog business was sequentially down 6.2% compared to the September quarter, reflecting the same broad macro weakness our microcontroller business experienced. Analog, however, was up 77.9% from the year-ago quarter. Analog represented 29.1% of our revenue in the December quarter. And during the quarter, we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products as well, including the industry's smallest multi-output MEMS clock generator, the industry's smallest five channel temperature sensor and the most robust silicon carbide diodes and MOSFETs in the industry. Our FPGA revenue hit another all-time record even after going back to the Microsemi and Actel history with 8.7% sequential growth compared to the September quarter. Our low-power, midrange PolarFire family continues to go on a -- garner strong market acceptance, while the prior generations continues to demonstrate consistent growth even in the current market environment. We also unveiled the industry's first RISC-V system on a chip FPGA architecture, combining the industry's lowest power midrange PolarFire FPGA family with a complete microprocessor subsystem based on the open, royalty-free RISC-V instruction set architecture. FPGA represented 7% of our revenue in the December quarter. Next, moving to our licensing business. This business is sequentially up 7.9% as compared to the September quarter. Our results reflect the sale of another type of license for a specific set of patents that can be used in noncompetitive fields of use. We anticipate that this patent license to close in the December quarter and include it in our guidance. We continue to retain indefinite rights to these patents for the field of use that are of interest to us. Our patent licensing strategy is to monetize portions of the substantial patent portfolio we inherited through our acquisitions by licensing select patents to players in noncompetitive fields of use. In all cases, we retain rights to use these patents in our products as well. We had meaningful patent license transactions in September and December quarters. Investors should expect that the revenue contribution in the future from this effort will be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. We do not expect meaningful contribution from the patent licensing in the March quarter. Our memory business was sequentially down 15% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. And finally, our multimarket and other business was down 3% sequentially compared to the September quarter. A quick update about the Microsemi integration. Business units, sales, operations and support groups are all making rapid progress. Our thanks and kudos go out to the combined company employees who are working hand-in-hand to achieve the accelerated synergy results. Overall, we are ahead of our synergy targets and expect continued synergy gains for many quarters to come. What will take us the longest is the business systems and operations integration, which is being done in phases. The first phase is where one of the business units went live on November 1, 2018. The second phase just went live on February 1 and involved three more business units, and more phase releases are planned with a steady cadence. We expect the overall business and operational integration will take about 15 to 18 more months to complete. Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Stephen Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2019. I will then provide update on our progress at Microsemi. I will then provide guidance for fiscal fourth quarter of 2019. Our December quarter non-GAAP financial results based on end-market demand exceeded our guidance for net sales, gross margin percentage, operating profit -- operating margin percentage and earnings per share. Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin reached an all-time record at 62.2% of net sales and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by about 100 basis points. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margins were strong at 37.4% of sales and exceeded the midpoint of guidance by about 130 basis points. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.095 per share. We are pleased with the financial results despite a very unfavorable business environment with the tariffs, slowdown in China, the European automotive issues, higher interest rates and under absorption charges from some of our factories. Let me also touch on the performance of Microsemi. Microsemi's non-GAAP operating profit reached a record. We are systematically improving Microsemi's financial performance and realizing significant synergies. At the time of our announcement of Microsemi acquisition, we had guided to $0.75 accretion run rate after the first year. After nearly seven months, we are well ahead of the $0.75 run rate for accretion from Microsemi. On non-GAAP basis, this was also our 113th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all employees of Microchip, including employees from our acquisitions, for their contribution. Now, let me provide you some further update on the progress we have made with the Microsemi integration. First, distribution inventory. After reducing the inventory and distribution channel in the September quarter, Microsemi distribution inventory remained stable at 2.6 months in the December quarter. We believe that at the current levels, distribution is holding the amount of inventory it needs to support the end-market demand. In last quarter's earnings conference call, we discussed moving several Microsemi customers back to being serviced directly that Microsemi had transferred to distribution. We completed this transition during the December quarter. Microsemi internal inventory. Microsemi's internal inventories are still high as we continue to maintain lower loadings in Microsemi's internal factories as well as subcontractors until the inventory comes in line. As we said from the beginning, Microsemi has very good engineering teams and very good products. The customers' pockets are sticky and we continue to believe there are very good end-market opportunities for the combined company. Our strategy for the better part of this decade has been to buy businesses and turn them into world-class performers in the likes of Microchip. Here, we started with excellent products, excellent gross margins and excellent engineering teams. With distributor and contract manufacturing inventories reduced and with Microchip's operating expense approach, we are optimistic about achieving our long-term targets for attrition from Microsemi. So far, we are ahead of our original target. Now, regarding guidance going forward. Beginning with this March quarter, as Eric mentioned, we are changing the information included in our financial guidance in response to comments and discussions with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission. After the GAAP standard change to sell-in revenue recognition, we continued to provide guidance and track our results based on sell-through revenue recognition and refer to the sell-through revenue as non-GAAP net sales. After the adoption of ASC 606, the feedback we received from investors and sell-side analysts had been very positive on a continuing use of sell-through revenue recognition in our reporting of non-GAAP net sales. We continue to strongly believe that managing our business on a sell-through basis is the appropriate way to run Microchip. Therefore, we will have preferred to continue to use our end-market demand as our non-GAAP sales. However, after receiving an SEC comment letter and discussing with the SEC, we have decided to provide net sales, sales guidance based on sell-in revenue recognition under the new GAAP standard. We will continue to provide non-GAAP guidance for gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share, but we will use sell-in days GAAP revenue for these calculations. When we report our results, we will also provide information on end-market demand so that investors can understand the consumption of our product in the marketplace, but we will not use the end-market demand for calculation of the non-GAAP P&L. Now, I will provide you guidance for the March quarter. The guidance we provided for the September and December quarters, which reflected our caution on business conditions, turned out in retrospect to be spot on and was a harbinger for broader industry weakness. We continue to be cautious about the outlook for the March quarter. We see a very uncertain business environment with tariffs, slowdown in China, European automotive issues, higher interest rates potentially causing U.S. GDP to slow down, any lingering effect of U.S. government shutdown and potential for further U.S. government shutdown. With all this commentary, we expect our total GAAP net sales based on sell-in revenue recognition for March quarter to be up 2% to down 9% sequentially. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61.2% and 61.8% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 25.8% and 26.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 34.7% and 36% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.26 per share to $1.53 per share. Again, all these ranges for non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share are based on GAAP revenue and sell-in revenue recognition. We also want to give the investors and analysts a sense of how we see the Microchip business past the March quarter. As you know, there's a substantial pending date of March 1, 2019 when, if there is no settlement between U.S. and China, a 25% tariff would kick in for about $200 billion of Chinese goods shipped into U.S. We think that the two governments will make some progress, but it is likely that the data from March 1, 2019 will be extended further out. Barring any material negative development on the trade front, we see the March 2019 quarter to mark the bottom of the cycle for Microchip. We cannot yet say what the shape of the recovery would be, whether the recovery be V-shaped, U-shaped or L-shaped. That will depend somewhat on the outcome of the trade talks. What we do see a bottom forming and believe that the March quarter will mark the bottom for this cycle for Microchip. Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and the inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis, except for net sales, which will be on GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go now to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach: I appreciate the color around kind of tariffs and how you're thinking about things kind of post-March. Just any signals that you're looking at in terms of calling the bottom here, whether it's kind of run rate of business, inventory distribution or customers? Just how you're seeing kind of the business overall kind of beyond the March quarter?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, we look at a variety of factors, including bookings and billings activity, discussion with our direct and distribution customers, distribution sell-through activity, customer cancellations, customer pull-ins, delivery push-outs and pull-ins. Whether 120,000 plus customers that we service in a vast range of end markets and applications, we really believe that we get a very broad perspective of what is happening in our business. Today, these indicators are telling us that the environment is still very uncertain driven by a variety of factors, including the trade situation. However, we don't see things getting worse at this point unless something more negative occurs on the trade front. Based on the vast amount of data that we get, we're releasing a framework for the formation of a bottom for this cycle in the March quarter.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, can you talk about, so far this quarter to-date, kind of January to February, what type of linearity you're seeing and how the business has been?
Stephen Sanghi: So business is tracking well to the guidance we are providing. We have seen the bookings stabilize and even increase somewhat very recently, but I would say it's a very short duration indicator and it's really not enough for -- a long enough time to be really making calls based on that.
Operator: We'll go next to Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Steve, I was hoping, first, if you could give us about a sense, as you think about the March quarter, if you think sell-through will be above or below or similar to the sell-in revenue that you're giving guidance for?
James Bjornholt: Yes. So we are -- we do not really have a good process for forecasting what the change in distribution inventory is going to be. That's not how we used to run our business historically, you know that, and that's why we've given the sell-through information or end-market demand consumption historically. We really feel, as we said kind of in our prepared remarks, that distribution inventory is in a good position to support what end-market consumption is. So I think at this point in time, we've given a pretty broad range of guidance for the quarter of plus 2 to down 9, so that's probably the broadest range of guidance you've seen from Microchip in a long time and some of that is the unpredictability of what the sell-in versus sell-through is going to be.
Mark Delaney: That's helpful. And then my follow-up question on the completed quarter, revenue and gross margins were above your guidance. Can you just give us a better sense for what enabled the company to exceed its guidance on those financial metrics?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, do you want to take that, Eric?
James Bjornholt: Sure. So, I mean, revenue was roughly 1% -- a little more than 1% better than our guidance was. And I think that's just kind of the puts and takes that we saw in the quarter, but it was good that we came in above the midpoint. And then on the gross margin side, we had a very favorable product mix in the quarter. We continue to really focus on cost reductions of our manufacturing areas. You know that we made quite a bit of changes in terms of any discounts that were previously given for the Microsemi portion of the business, on sales to distributors or contract manufacturers, and we're really seeing the benefit reflect itself in the gross margin today.
Operator: We'll now take a question from Ambrish Srivastava from Bank of Montreal.
Ambrish Srivastava: Maybe just take stick to the gross margin side. Your guidance is, on a Q-over-Q, that's a pretty big delta, but yet your margins are coming in a much stronger than what I would have modeled it. Could you just help us understand the dynamics there in the guided two quarters, especially in light of your inventory came down as well? And I'm expecting you're not building inventory in the quarter. And then I have a quick follow-up.
Stephen Sanghi: Is your question that the gross margins are coming down, but the operating margins are not as much?
Ambrish Srivastava: No. My question is gross margin are -- gross margin is coming in stronger than what I would have modeled given your shortfall in the revenues versus what the street was expecting.
Stephen Sanghi: Well, I think the same reason why the gross margins were strong this quarter. We are getting an uplift from a lot of the discounts that were given to the distribution channel and contract manufacturers and others. And a lot of the business of that was moved to distribution from the Microsemi business, we have completed that conversion back to direct and, therefore, you take out the distribution margin hit. So all that is having a positive effect on ASPs and our margins. We are continuing to reduce cost in all of our factories. There is still a lot of Atmel products, which was outside. Every quarter, more and more of it is coming in. There is also some Microsemi product we're starting to bring in. Some of the expenses have been taken out from the manufacturing overhead in synergies. So we have a lot of moving parts and the product mix is very healthy.
Ambrish Srivastava: Okay. Good. And then my quick follow-up, Steve, usually things don't turn around that quickly. And it's a small piece of your business. FPGA, if my memory serves me correct, it was kind of in the $320 million, $325 million run rate annual, and you posted $100 million quarter. What's going on? Is there, hopefully not a last time buy, but some design wins that are ramping?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. There are no last time buys in FPGA that are driving that revenue. There has been feed zone for many quarters on some of the new products, the fourth and fifth generation of the FPGA products. There's some of the FPGA, which is exposed to markets like defense and aerospace, they have some quarter-ending budget that needs to be spent. But it's a stable, solid business and we see many, many good characteristics for how that can be continued to be built on. Quarter-to-quarter, we may have small changes, but our overall, if you look at annualized revenue, it's on a nice good growth path for us.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya: So Steve, can you give us some color by end market, whether it's industrial or autos or consumer or communications, where you are perhaps seeing better or worse trends than what the midpoint of your March outlook would suggest?
Stephen Sanghi: Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. Rather than going segment-by-segment, I think we have previously indicated that the automotive, industrial and consumer home appliance markets were weaker in the last quarter. Especially as we look at this in the guidance for this quarter, we're seeing the addition to that, the data center market, the communication markets have also started to have some softening that goes with it. So at this point in time, I can't pick any one of them to say this is the main reason why the strength is coming or the weakness is coming. I think we're seeing a broad-based weakness and even some which were stronger last quarter are less strong at this point in time. Defense and aerospace has continued to be strong. It could have some impact this quarter from the government shutdown and what impacts that may have, but that's all built into our guidance at this point.
Stephen Sanghi: I think aerospace and defense is a market in its own. It's in its own space and it doesn't really follow the usual -- what happens in industrial, consumer and other. It's a very different business. We did see some impact from the government shutdown where we couldn't get certain export licenses processed and some programs were not released, but we kind of expect it to square up in the quarter and that really help any significant impact going out of the quarter. There is some impact of a budget flush and there's a lot of budget flush in September and December quarters where all these large customers, they have government budgets and they need to spend it. Otherwise, they use it or lose it. And so March quarter is sequentially down in that segment because of the budget flush.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, Steve, if we, let's say, do have a trade resolution in the next few weeks, do you think there is a potential for an inventory refill? Or do you think the industry is shipping to consumption right now, so we should not be modeling any better than seasonal quarters going forward?
Stephen Sanghi: I don't know about how everybody else is doing, so I will just speak for Microchip rather than the industry. A settlement of trade would be a bonanza. Our customers and distributors are so cautious. There is low visibility. They're building bare bones what they need for the backlog from their customers. Nobody wants to get stuck with anything depending on what happens. If the trade talks are settled prior to March 1, this would be a big bonanza.
James Bjornholt: Yes. Vivek, just to add to that, as you can tell from our last two quarters of actual results where our end-market demand was higher than what the sell-in revenue was, there's definitely a bleed-down of the distribution inventory and we don't think that the end customer is probably any different, although we don't get real data points on that.
Stephen Sanghi: Yes. So we are not shipping to consumption as you said. We're shipping well below consumption.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: I guess, Eric, you said in your prepared comments, you made the comment that the guide for the March quarter on the revenue is wider than normal. Can you help me understand, to what extent is that just a reflection of how uncertain this environment is and to what extent is that just a reflection of having now to guide just sort of a sell-in revenue? And as we think about future quarters, is this now the right range of guidance around the midpoint you're going to give us or is this just wider because of uncertainty?
James Bjornholt: I believe it is the combination of both, right? I mean, we haven't given guidance historically based on sell-ins. So this is new to Microchip and we don't feel that we have a good way to understand if distribution inventory is going to increase or decrease in a period. So that is a factor, but obviously the environment is very uncertain. So I can't parse it out in terms of what percentage is each, but I -- this is just a pretty broad range of guidance...
Stephen Sanghi: Yes. So I think -- I would just say, maybe sticking my neck out a little bit, that over time, I think we will learn to have the guidance narrower. We have a very broad distribution. We do business with over 100 distributors around the world, which is not the case with many other semiconductor players that do business with largely 3 or 4 large distributors. We, as you know in the past, we have large distributors, which we call global distributors, we have catalog houses and we have nearly 80 to 100 distributors in China alone. So our distribution network is very, very broad. And to really figure out what everybody is going to buy, those are not the profits that we worked on in the past. We don't really care what distributor buys. We care about what distributor sells out and our processes take care of that. So we will get better at it very rapidly. We're not saying years. We're saying quarters. We'll get better at it and guidance will narrow. And the other impact is the uncertain environment. Once the environment gets more certain, I think we'll narrow it also.
James Bjornholt: Yes, and I think another contributor factor is that the lead times are very, very short today, right? So backlog visibility is not great.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. Then maybe for my follow-up, guys. I just wanted to go back to the gross margin, a couple of other questions were asked around that. I'm just kind of curious, given that, Steve, you mentioned you're undershipping demand today. In conjunction with sort of the slowdown at the industry level, you were also working through some excesses that the Microsemi business had when you bought it. I'm just kind of curious, how should we be thinking about utilization now? Have you done all the utilization adjustments you needed to? And I guess, more importantly, as business comes back and you benefit from increasing utilization and some of the more in-sourcing activities you're doing, how do we think about kind of that long-term target gross margin? Because relative to that 63% you've talked about, you're not too far away in what's a really rather lackluster business environment. Is 63% the right margin to think about or could it be higher?
Stephen Sanghi: Good question, as always. Just to keep that question on the back of your mind, and I think as we get further, as we establish 63%, then we will assess further. Right now, especially Microsemi factories are significantly underloaded because we first corrected the distribution inventory, and then the internal inventories were much higher, the internal inventories from Microsemi that we inherited are a lot higher than really the level of inventory at Microchip. So we have a number of factories running at 50% capacity, a number of them are running something higher than that. So overall utilization is very low. But, I made this point last quarter, I think only about 10% to 20% of -- 15% of Microsemi business is done in the internal factories, that comes from the foundries. So from foundries, we have aggressively cut the starts and assembly and test loading to really bring that down rapidly at subcontractors. Internal, we have carried and the factories are running below capacity. And when the business comes back, we get some improvement from utilization from the internal factories but there were only 15% of Microsemi business, they're only probably 5% of our business, total, Microchip. So just be careful.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.
Harsh Kumar: One for Steve and one for Eric. Steve, I wanted to ask about your comment about marking the bottom in March, a couple of other broad companies have said the same thing. But they are usually talking about either some sort of stabilization in the backlog or some kind of metric that they are watch and monitoring. I'm also -- when you make that statement, I'm also hearing sort of, Ganesh, in response to a question said, things are still getting worse in some of the markets. So I'm curious if you have any kind of tangible data in terms of either backlog or orders or something else you could point to. And do you think the China industry is sort of flushed at this point in time and that's we're basically shipping to true demand or maybe undershipping and that's the reason why you feel better about it? And then I've got a follow-up for Eric.
Stephen Sanghi: Well, I would say some of the data center and other business you're talking about, they're also down somewhat seasonally and they're weaker seasonally because March quarter is weaker compared to September and December quarters in which year-end shipments happen. But I think the question you're really asking is, what gives us the confidence that the March market will mark the bottom, is that the question?
Harsh Kumar: Yes, yes.
Stephen Sanghi: Okay. So I think I would say we really can't present you enough data to convince you and we're not going to try. What we can tell you is that our current backlog for June quarter is about flat with the backlog we had for the March quarter on November 5, okay? So that may look flat. But then you have to look at after November 5, we had a bunch of holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas and then Chinese New Year in the March quarter. There are no major holidays for June quarter. So starting with the flat backlog and going into the stronger quarters without the holidays, that's why we say barring any significantly negative developments on the trade negotiations with China, we believe that June quarter will strengthen or we're confident that it should not be sequentially down again. But the second point I would say, Harsh, is, and I don't mean this for all the analysts and for all the investors, there are lots of them that have followed us for a long time and believe the calls we make, but there are a lot of the others who don't.  We have made numerous calls in the last 15 years or so for the business environment to turn negative and then turn positive. When we first make a negative call, first it is not believed, it's even ridiculed a few times. Then 3 to 4 months later, what we say gets confirmed and everybody goes down. Then comes the recovery part of the call, it is not believed either. As we go on the road over and over and over we get the question, what gives you the confidence, and we answer it. That is not believed either. So to my recollection, we have not been wrong in 15-plus years in calling the downturn, and we have not been wrong in the same time frame calling the upturn. That's what gives us the confidence. Like you saying your business, past performance is no guarantee of the future results. So we don't guarantee anything. So of course, our confidence is subject to some number of risks, but I think that's the narrative I'd like to explain.
Harsh Kumar: No, that's very helpful actually. And then question for Eric was, how much free cash flow do you expect by your calculation to be available for debt payment in March? And if that's the base level number and we expect business to get kind of better so we can get an idea of what you're kind of going to be able to do hopefully going forward if nothing macro changes?
James Bjornholt: Sure. We expect somewhere between a $175 million and $200 million of debt pay down in the current quarter. The last two quarters were significantly higher than that. I would say that we obviously are coming off where accounts receivable is down quarter-over-quarter. We had some very good help from some of our customers and some of our vendors in terms of payment terms and negotiating that, and really making significant progress compared to what our guidance was in the December quarter, but we don't really have those levers to pull in the current quarter. So I don't think I'd use that $175 million to $200 million as kind of an ongoing run rate. We do expect that it will get significantly better from this point forward, but we'll continue focus really all of our excess cash generation outside of the dividend on paying down debt.
Operator: We'll go to William Stein with SunTrust for our next question.
William Stein: Steve, I'd like to maybe take a different approach to the sort of cycle and recovery question. Acknowledging that you've tended to call these turns early and correct, I just want to understand what's giving you the confidence -- from the perspective of trade, we have this March 1 deadline hanging over us, and it sounds like you're providing us with some, not guidance, but some sense of demand post-March quarter that implies this gets resolved constructively. And I'm just wondering why you feel confident to do that? And then I have a follow-up, please.
Stephen Sanghi: I don't know if that's what I'm saying. Actually, I'm saying very clearly that barring any significant negative developments from the trade front, that was the caveat in what I said. And what I also said was that I think with a month to go to March 1, I think the governments are making progress, there are positive signals coming out of the White House. You recall how negatively signals were coming out regarding Canada during one of the conferences, I think. And then all of a sudden, a week later it all came out good. So it's -- Trump had used that strategy in a way and then not those negative signals coming about China. So I think the progress must be good, but it's a lot of work to get done. And I'm simply saying, it's most likely that there's some positive announcement but the actual settlement gets pushed out further. The settlement gets pushed out further, the environment we're seeing remains. Our guidance assumes a fairly current environment continuing. And if that current environment continues, then June quarter is still better than March quarter.
William Stein: Okay. One other question on the Microsemi integration. I know that -- I recall they acquired Vectron, a lower-margin business right before you acquired the whole company, and that was a -- they had never reported a quarter with that asset. And there were some other things in their portfolio that might not have met Microchip's, I don't know, view of a great business to be in. I'm wondering if you've made any portfolio adjustments, if you've closed any of their businesses so that we can think about maybe a different margin profile or growth profile when demand normalizes and all the inventory adjustments are made?
Stephen Sanghi: We have not. We have not sold any of the businesses, we have not closed any other of the Vectron factories. We're running the business. You are correct that the business is at a lower gross margin. We're using our usual techniques. We are trying to improve the gross margins. We asked the management, they also -- Microsemi had to cut some expenses, and we have cut some. So the contribution to EBITDA is actually much higher than really what it was originally. But the gross margin, if you only focus on that, then the gross margins are lower. We have other businesses at Microchip where the gross margins are lower than our corporate margin. We have also many businesses that are higher, in the 70s and 80s. So at the end of the day, it's a mix.
Ganesh Moorthy: If your question goes beyond Vectron. In the last two conference calls, we've also mentioned as part of our integration effort, we have reviewed every single business. And while there are many, many excellent businesses, there were some that needed improvement. And we have made adjustments in terms of level of investment we're making in those businesses to be better overall result for us as well. So -- but that's all largely behind us. At this point, as Steve mentioned, on Vectron and all the other businesses, we're working on improving what we inherited and making significant progress towards that.
Stephen Sanghi: And when the factories come back to full production, as we take out these excess inventories, Vectron business will see substantial cost reduction through higher utilization in that factories, their numbers are going to start looking much better.
Operator: We'll now take a question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Christopher Caso: Just wanted to ask a question about revenue geographically. And I guess that we probably anticipate some of the weakness that you've seen in Asia that you talked about before. It look liked from the results that you saw a downtick in Europe also. Can you talk about that? And if there's anything specific geographically you're anticipating as you go into the March quarter?
James Bjornholt: I can take that. So I mean, the in all geographies, we're down. We posted this on our website. So it's available for everybody to see and will be in our 10-Q filing. But all geographies were down. It is not unusual at all for the Americas and Europe to be down in the December quarter just because of all the holidays. And typically, we see strength from Asia in that time period prior to leading in the Chinese New Year in the current quarter. But I think all geographies were weak. This weakness was not just the China issue, it's just kind of spread across the globe. And in terms of forecast for the next quarter or the current quarter that we're in, we don't really break out the forecast by product line or geography.
Stephen Sanghi: But I think directionally, March quarter, usually, our European business is strong, our China business is weak because of Chinese New Year, even in a normal time, we're also dealing with trade here, and the U.S. business is kind of normal. So I think directionally, it can have that.
Christopher Caso: Okay. And just as a follow-up, the follow-up question's on revenue of linearity through the quarter and kind of expectations for March as well. And you mentioned last quarter that you saw a slight uptick, I guess, in the first month of the quarter. I presume that downtick towards the end of the quarter. And then how do typically see linearity as you go through the March quarter again taking in consideration the Chinese New Year holiday in the middle?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, so I think the uptick we talked about in bookings in November call basically did not hold. I think you've heard from everybody that December was fairly weak. That's always the problem in making decisions based on very short-term data. And I said that earlier that our bookings have normalized very -- lately, we have even seen some strength. But don't take it to the bank yet, I'm not taking it to the bank. We have made the call today, at the midpoint down about 3.5% sequentially from GAAP-to-GAAP revenue. This does not include any dramatic improvement of bookings or improvement of trade or anything like that. I think it just assumes that the market stays in the doldrum.
Operator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: In terms of executing on the March quarter guide and maybe providing the team with a bit more confidence on the June quarter kind of qualitative outlook, historically, how much hinges upon the replenishment rates post-Chinese New Year? And when do typically get these signals? Is it two weeks, three weeks after Chinese New Year?
Stephen Sanghi: So March quarter sometimes lands up very much depending on where that Chinese New Year falls based on the lunar calendar. Earlier the Chinese New Year, the better than March quarter usually lands up being because Chinese customers can go slow before that and they come back and then they see all charged up and ramp up their factories. So Chinese New Year is happening this week, which we will consider kind of early because it can be late February, it can even be fairly late. But it has been even earlier sometime in late January. But this is really early to mid. So this is good sign, and we will see what happens after Chinese New Year.
Harlan Sur: Okay. No, I appreciate the insights there. I know you guys are waiting for the Gartner data, but just looking at the recent SIA data, the MCU segment was down about 4% sequentially in Q4 versus your MCBU business, which was down about 9% sequentially. I know you guys look at this data as well. Any reason for the big delta? Is it sell-in versus sell-through so not a fair comparison?
Ganesh Moorthy: I think in any given quarter, you're going to find that the data is more noisy. It's easier to look at these on a four quarter rolling basis, and that's what we expect when we'll see the 2018 data. So there is no doubt in our mind we're gaining market share. But quarter-to-quarter, the numbers can be more noisy.
Operator: Our next question will come from Gil Alexandre with Darphil.
Gilbert Alexandre: From all that say, it seems that your 300 synergies is pretty good number looking for fiscal '21 or '22.
Stephen Sanghi: So what I would say to that is we are ahead of the accretion target today. Just in some cases, we have pulled some of the synergies in, it had gone better in term of integration but we haven't revised the final number. The other major change that happened is that business environment recession that we're going through that we have not built into the forecast, nobody had anticipated it back then. It will depend on the shape of the recovery. If the recovery is fast like it has happened in some prior cycles, then we get back on that schedule. If the recovery is a lot slower and it's kind of the L-shaped recovery, it stays in doldrums for a year, then the schedule for achieving that may have to be adjusted. But I don't think we are uncomfortable with the number, total accretion.
Gilbert Alexandre: So it really means that you get $8 non-GAAP earnings in fiscal '21 or '22, or you could?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, you're putting words in my mouth. But that was our forecast then. And again, depending on the shape of the recovery, that is still our target.
Gilbert Alexandre: Okay. And your long-term model targets stays the same as you made in March of 2018?
Stephen Sanghi: Correct. I think state them again for everybody?
James Bjornholt: So it is 63% gross margin, 22.5% operating expenses and 40.5% operating margin on a non-GAAP basis.
Stephen Sanghi: Yes, thank you.
Gilbert Alexandre: And do I need to be concerned that autos represent 17% of your mix?
Stephen Sanghi: Autos has been a very good business and you shouldn't be concerned. We have just a tremendous funnel of the design wins in automotive for future and all that, significant entry into various electric vehicles around the world and autonomous vehicles around the world. So there's really no reason to be concerned. The issue in automotive market have been two. One is, Europe implemented a new emission standard for their diesel vehicle starting September 1. And all the agencies had a one year notice, they knew a year ahead of time, that the new emission standard was going to effect on September 1, 2018. September 1, 2018, came and there was no capacity. People kind of just felt sleep on the switch. So there were millions of cars taking away airport parking lots that can't be on the road because they don't pass emission standard. So that created a significant dislocation in the European car market, it's working through it, will take more time to work through all that. So that was one issue. And the second issue was the slowdown in China. China is now the largest automotive market, larger than U.S. and larger than Europe. And China is going through its own issues of slowdown and stock market crash and some of the people's wealth has been affected. So the China automotive market, all that will come back.
Ganesh Moorthy: And Gil, if I can add one more point. The consumption of electronics going into cars continues to go up year after year after year. So -- and in many years, that consumption of electronics going up offsets any reduction in production as well. And so that's been the long-term trend and remain so.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin Cassidy: Maybe just on the 32-bit micro traction that you're seeing. Can you just say what end markets it is? Maybe -- your discussion around automotive, maybe that plays into it. But can you say which end markets you're gaining the traction?
Ganesh Moorthy: We're broadly represented in the 32-bit microcontroller market. The standard products are broadly represented in all the end markets, it's a ubiquitous product. I can't pick any one of them that's necessarily the one that's going there. But we've been coming off of a -- a being lower in the rankings. We're rapidly coming up the rankings. And as we do that, it has to come from all the different segments that we play in.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay, great. Maybe is there such a thing as an upgrade from the -- your 8 and 16-bit customers going to 32? Is that helping your traction?
Ganesh Moorthy: No, not at all. I think, the 8 and 16 bits are continuing to do well. And again, when you see the annual results for 2018, you'll see that all three segments as it was in prior years are doing well. The 32-bit, we have more capabilities that have come both organically as well as through the acquisitions. It's allowing us to play in a number of incremental markets that perhaps we couldn't get to a few years ago. And so I think the point of providing some color was there was a sense of perhaps 32-bit was still very small for us and we were just playing in 8 and 16s. Now 32-bit, at over $1.2 billion annualized based on the last two quarters, is a pretty significant portion of a $3 billion-plus annualized microcontroller market for us.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Rolland with Susquehanna.
Christopher Rolland: Steve, so regardless of the SEC's opinion, this analyst supports you that the standard should be sell-through, for what it's worth. But in terms of a question, now that we're a few quarters into Microsemi, what has been the biggest positive surprise for you in terms of products and traction and demand for those products positively since you guys close?
Stephen Sanghi: So I would say that we confirm usually a lot of positives after we close the acquisition. We don't usually find new positives because the management's always, those are the positive that's been out, and they're selling their company, so they're really not hidden positives. We usually find some new negatives that we may not have known or may not have fully understood or may not have been fully explained as you have seen. But on the positive side, we don't get surprises but we get confirmation. And here, as I said, we got a very good confirmation, the products are very good, customer sockets are very sticky in discrete military products, in FPGA sockets, in a lot of the analog sockets, in timing business and data center businesses. They're very good businesses, they're good sticky sockets, very complex products as well as very simple discrete product. So it has a range of products and very, very good engineering teams, very, very good work done. And I think we have continuously said that we feel very good about it. Business fits very well with Microchip. We have truly enhanced the ASPs and gross margins by a methodology of discontinuing the -- some of the discounts and all that. We brought the inventories to the right levels. Internal inventory, we're still working through. As we revamp the factories, I think they will have some more positive effect. So all that is very good. I think we feel good about where we are.
Christopher Rolland: Great. And then on some of the PMCS products, whether it's optical or storage, given kind of the well-known storage slowdown trends that we've seen out there more broadly, and then some guys talking about a data center slowdown or hyperscale digestion out there, have you seen any of this at all? And have you seen that play into either optical or storage for you guys?
Ganesh Moorthy: I think, built into our guidance for this quarter, as I mentioned earlier, it does reflect that there is some weakness in those two segments in communications and data center. It's not different from what others have been talking about as well. And we are seeing that in the Microsemi products that play into those segments.
Stephen Sanghi: But I think I don't think anybody questions the strength of data center or communication market as a good market longer term. Any segment is going to go through inventory digestion and cycles. The question we were dealing with was, is Microsemi a good business? Is it the right direct acquisition? Is short-term cycle coming in? And having some hyperscale digestion for a quarter or two will not really factor into our decision. I think this will be a very good business long term.
Operator: Our next question will come from Rajvindra Gill with Needham and Company.
Rajvindra Gill: Forgive me if this question was asked because I'm joining late, but I was wondering if you can make a distinction between any potential trade settlement or trade agreement versus the actual deceleration that's happening in the Chinese economy. So meaning, if there is some sort of trade settlement, what impact would that have in the business environment? Or is it just maybe taking one risk off the table but the reality is that the economy is slowing down dramatically and the trade agreement would really more have a sentiment improvement but nothing really changing in terms of actual business? Just wondering if you could -- or if you -- maybe if you could just elaborate on that.
Stephen Sanghi: So Raji, I think our assessment is that trade is the problem why Chinese economy is weakening so much. China has been the production center for the world. And as these trades came in, Chinese goods became more expensive and threaten to go more expensive, with $200 billion of Chinese goods getting 25% tariff, that's a $50 billion tax. So companies have moved production out of China to the extent they could, to the extend the product was running in two different factories and one was outside. But there is just not enough capacity outside of China to take all that outside. But there are lots of them in works. With the tariffs, Chinese stock market has taken a major hit. And Chinese consumers use the stock market as the cash machine to run their businesses and buy cars and buy stocks. So I think you cannot take the trade issue away from the Chinese economy. As the trade issue is settled, that is the boost that the Chinese economy will need. And then the people will have to think about do they stop taking factories outside of China or would the trade talk settle, all that effort stops. I can't know what would happen there. Is there a future risk? If there is complete removal of trade barriers, then I think nobody's want to do the work to move the factories outside. If the settlement happens where there's significant barrier on both sides, then all that will continue.
Rajvindra Gill: That's helpful. And along those same lines, do you think there will be some sort of fiscal stimulus in addition to the -- if there's a trade agreement but a fiscal stimulus coming out of the Chinese government?
Stephen Sanghi: I thought there already was one.
Ganesh Moorthy: There are some small ones that have been done. But we don't have any inside knowledge of them.
Rajvindra Gill: Post New Year? Post-Chinese New Year?
Stephen Sanghi: I think there was one small one done. But I would think, yes, if there is a settlement in trade post-Chinese New Year, whenever Chinese economy has been weak, that's what they have done, stimulus for various things. That's largely predictable. And I don't know, I don't have a line to the Premier, but I think that's really what would happen.
Operator: We'll take our next Janet Ramkissoon from Quadra Capital.
Janet Ramkissoon: Just a question about China again. Have you -- could you comment on the business with ZTE in the quarter? Did you see a recovery there? And do you have any exposure specifically to Huawei?
Stephen Sanghi: So ZTE had no restrictions in the quarter and our business was normal. I think we said in the prior quarter, there was some demand distraction where during the time, ZTE couldn't build a product. They lost some designs and competitor picked it up. And in certain cases, we got design with a competitor also; in certain cases, we did not. But ZTE business is kind of normal. The Huawei business is normal. There is a lot of talk about the U.S. indictment and their CFO has been detained in Canada. There has been no impact of any of that on the Huawei business yet.
Operator: Our next question will come from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.
Craig Ellis: Steve, I wanted to go back to the issue of integration with Microsemi but approach it more qualitatively than quantitatively understanding that you're not changing any target at this point. So as we look at calendar 2019, can you just touch on what the key integration milestones are, objectives are, top 2 or 3, for sales items and channel management? And then the follow-up, I'll just hit it right now because it's similar. If we looked lower on the income statement at manufacturing and operating expenses, what would be some of the key issues you'd want to tackle this year in those areas as well?
Stephen Sanghi: We're moving forward on a very, very wide beachfront, so pick one. When we bought Microsemi, Microsemi compiled their results on 21 different ERP systems, business unit by business unit, and then they are compiled, somewhat like a conglomerate. We -- the companies we have bought, we have brought them all into our enterprise system and ran a single enterprise system for years and years. With Microsemi, we have said, we're going to go down to two systems. I would love to go down to one, but the work was just too much. So we were 22, one of us and 21 of Microsemi. From 22, we'll go down to two. And we're making progress. We took one business in into our system on November 1. We took three on February 1. We have another 3-or-so planned for May 1. And then there'll be a cadence of these go-live every quarter. In another 12 to 18 months, we will consolidate. So that's a huge project with lots of synergy and accretion coming from that. The business units in terms of the marketing and design and pipelines and integration with our technologies and factories and all that is largely some done, some ongoing. Most of Microsemi parts are not going to come into our factories. Like PMC-Sierra parts, they run in foundries, and FPGA parts run in foundries, and they are going to come in inside. But certain products of other business units may come in, and that's an ongoing process. As far as sales is concerned, sales all work for a common sales leader. So that's already done. The biggest job in sales is cross-training and cross-pollinating. So a Microchip salesperson feel very confident selling Microsemi products, and in a total system solution gets all those designed in. And vice versa, a Microsemi person feels very confident with Microchip. With $4 billion company on one side, $2 billion company on other side, that takes some time. And that's progressing. And how we kind of make it work is really a -- is a team where you call on the expert from the Microchip side or the Microsemi side to make the joint call so you start to get your total system solution effect. And that, we're already getting. The reviews we see from various businesses in the Microsemi reviews, we see Microchip parts designed in, in the future boards and on the Microchip reviews, we see the Microsemi parts designed in. So that is starting to happen. But a lot more needs to happen.
Craig Ellis: That's helpful. And on the last point, Steve, is that something that will bear fruit from a revenue standpoint this year? Or does that just put you in a position where you've got the design win and then you work through what can often be a 12 to 18 month gestation period before that design would go to revenue?
Stephen Sanghi: It's the latter. The designs take about 9 months to 2 years to go to production depending on how complex it is. You could have a very simple, some discrete parts, et cetera, something that are designed in. There could be faster, but there are complicated parts which could be longer. So it's really, yes, there's a gestation period after you get the design in. You should see some revenue coming out of TSS in 2020, and then it accelerates from there.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.
Stephen Sanghi: Well, we want to thank everyone for joining this call today. And we'll be seeing some of you between now and the next conference call. On the road, there are various conferences we'll be going to. So thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2018-11-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone, welcome to this Microchip Technologies Second Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Financial Results Conference. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn things over to Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2019 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and provide an update on our integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I want to remind investors that during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we adopted a new GAAP revenue recognition standard, which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy, where revenue on such transactions were deferred until the product was sold by our distributors to an end customer. We are not able to provide guidance on a GAAP basis, as we are not able to predict whether inventory at our distributors will increase or decrease in relation to end market demand, and this is not how we manage our business. As evidence of this uncertainty, in recent years, we have seen net inventory at our distributors increase or decrease by a significant amount in a single quarter. Our non-GAAP revenue is based on true end market demand in which we measure the revenue based on when the product is sold by our distributors to an end customer. We will continue to manage our business and distributor relationships based on creating and fulfilling end market demand. All of Microchip's bonus programs will continue to work based on the amount of revenue we earned from fulfilling end market demand. Therefore, along with the GAAP results based on sell-in, we will also report our non-GAAP results based on sell-through revenue recognition. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, using revenue based on end market demand, and expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were $1.513 billion, just above the midpoint of our guidance, and up 24.4% sequentially from net sales of $1.217 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.7%, operating expenses were 23.4% of sales, and operating income was a record $579.3 million and 38.3% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was a record $454.6 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.81, which was $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance of $1.74. On a GAAP basis, net sales in the September quarter were $1.433 billion. GAAP revenue was impacted by a significant reduction in the Microsemi distribution channel during the quarter, resulting in Microsemi distributor months of inventory being down to 2.6 months. We believe at the current levels, the distributors are holding the amount of inventory needed to support end market demand, and that the inventory levels are in line with the levels maintained by our distributors for our historical business. GAAP gross margins were 48.1% and include the impact of $3.9 million of share-based compensation, a $184.4 million of acquisition-related and acquired inventory valuation and other costs, and $56.1 million impact from changes in distributor inventory levels. Total operating expenses were $586.6 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $169.9 million, special charges of $18.2 million, $6.6 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and share-based compensation of $37.5 million. The GAAP net income was $96.3 million or $0.38 per diluted share and includes one-time tax benefits of $115.6 million related to a variety of matters including tax reserve releases due to audit settlements and statute of limitations expiring, tax reform and transition tax refinement, and intercompany restructuring of intellectual property. The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 3.5% in the September quarter, and we expect a similar rate for all of fiscal 2019. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 to be 5% or less, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring of the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure, and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses, tax credits and interest deductions that will keep our cash tax payments low. The transition tax for the combined Microchip-Microsemi Group is expected to be about $364 million, was recorded last fiscal year, and will be paid over eight years. We have posted a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website. For GAAP purposes, we had a significant tax benefit in the quarter for the variety of reasons I discussed earlier. Moving onto the balance sheet; our inventory balance at September 30, 2018 was $836.7 million, including a $120.1 million of inventory mark-up from Microsemi required for GAAP purchase accounting [ph]. Excluding the inventory mark-up, we had 117 days of inventory at the end of September quarter, which was down two days from the prior quarter levels. Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter were 37 days compared to 40 days at the end of June. As indicated earlier, we believe that our distributors are holding an appropriate level of inventory to support end market demand. The cash flow from operating activities was a record $487.6 million in the September quarter. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $464.2 million. We paid down $501 million of total debt in the September quarter, and the net debt on the balance sheet reduced by $315.5 million. At September 30, our debt outstanding includes $3.1 billion of borrowings under our line of credit, $2.733 billion of Term Loan B, $2 billion in high-grade bonds, and $4.481 billion of convertible debt. Our net debt to EBITDA excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037, and is more equity like in nature, was 4.9 at September 30, 2018. Our leverage is higher than we originally projected, primarily due to lower EBITDA from the Microsemi business, driven by needing to correct distribution inventory levels through lower shipment activity in the month of June, as well as in the September 2018 quarter. As indicated earlier, we believe the distribution inventory correction for Microsemi is essentially complete. We are committed to using substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond our dividend payment to reduce our debt levels and we expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our net leverage metrics are based on 12-month trailing EBITDA, which will continue to provide some headwinds due to the significant distribution inventory reductions which caused our shipment activity to be significantly less than end market demand for the past two quarters, as well as our guidance for the December 2018 quarter. Capital expenditures were $72 million in the September 2018 quarter, we expect about $50 million in capital spending in the December quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 to be about $230 million to $250 million. We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies, and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $47.2 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter, and provide an update on some of the Microsemi integration activities. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric and good afternoon, everyone. As I review our product line performance, please bear in mind that the September quarter has a full quarter of contribution from Microsemi, while the June quarter only had a month of contribution from Microsemi. This along with the fact that Microsemi revenue only maps into four of the six product line reporting categories we have, while in some cases distort the quarter-over-quarter comparisons of revenue by product line. Taking a closer look at microcontrollers; our microcontroller business was sequentially up 12.6% as compared to the June quarter. This benefited from a full quarter of Microsemi contribution in September as compared to a partial quarter for June. Our September quarter microcontroller revenue annualizes at almost $3.3 billion, putting us within striking distance in the next few years of the two industry players who are ahead of us in the 2017 microcontroller rankings. Our microcontroller portfolio continues to expand with several new product introductions, our roadmaps remain strong, and our designing funnel is robust. We see all these as positive indicators for future growth. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share in the future. Now moving to analog; our analog business was sequentially up 33.6% as compared to the June quarter. This too benefited from a full quarter of Microsemi contribution in September as compared to a partial quarter for June. Our September quarter analog revenue annualizes at over $1.75 billion, firmly in the Top 10 of analog semiconductor players. With Microchip 2.0 and our total system solutions approach, we expect to continue to grow and gain further analog market share. Next up is our FPGA business, which came to Microchip through the Microsemi acquisition. Our FPGA revenue hit an all-time record even after going back through the Microsemi and Actel [ph] history. Our low power mid-range PolarFire family continues to garner strong market acceptance with revenue more than doubling sequentially as compared to the end market consumption in the full June quarter. Despite being a new product category for Microchip, we are optimistic about the prospects for the FPGA product line based on the highly defensible markets and applications they are designed into, as well as the intense design win focus and broad-based market application and customer focus requiring. These requirements are very similar to Microchip's microcontroller business requirements, and therefore, we expect the FPGA product line will very nicely leverage our capabilities. Moving next to our licensing business; this business was sequentially up 40.3% as compared to the June quarter. We achieved an all-time record for our royalty revenue. Additionally, our results also benefited from the sale of a patent license for a specific set of patents that can be used in non-competitive fields of play. We did anticipate this patent license to close in the September quarter and included it in our guidance. We continue to retain indefinite rights for these patents for the fields of players that are of interest to us. Even without the patent license sale, the September quarter licensing business revenue was sequentially up from June. Let me share some background as to our thinking in regards to patent licensing. We have inherited a substantial patent portfolio from the companies we acquired over the last 10 years. Several quarters ago, based on licensing request we were receiving, our licensing business unit embarked on a strategy to monetize certain patents, which have value to players in non-competitive fields of play. In all cases, we retained rights to use these patents in our products as well. The first results from this monetizing effort is what we saw in the September quarter results. There is a second such patent license sale for a specific set of patents which is in the advanced stages of negotiation, and is included in our guidance for the December quarter. Investors should expect that the revenue contribution in the future from this effort will be a little lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. Our memory business was sequentially down 3.8% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. And finally, our MMO, which stands for multi-market and other business was up 90.7% sequentially as we had a full quarter of Microsemi contribution in the September quarter, as compared to just a month in the June quarter. On a combined company basis, which has a full quarter of Microchip and Microsemi, our second quarter fiscal of 2019 non-GAAP end market demand revenue of $1.51 billion was split across the six product lines we report as follows: microcontrollers were 54.2%, analog was 29%, FPGA was 6%, memory was 3.1%, licensing was 2.5% and MMO was 5.2%. We expect this will be the approximate forward going revenue percentages by product line, and that quarter-to-quarter changes from here onwards will be relatively small. Now an update on the Microsemi integration progress; the business unit integration continues to progress well. We are restructuring underperforming businesses, while implementing the strengths and best practices from both companies to drive improvements across the board. The key Microsemi business unit leaders we retained continue to run their businesses, and are adapting to the Microchip culture and business expectations. New product development and design win momentum are continuing to happen as planned. The sales integration is also progressing well. We have converted the Microsemi sales team to a Microchip's style non-commissioned sales approach. Teams from Classic Microchip and Microsemi are working collaboratively as one team to drive new opportunities and pursue product cross-selling opportunities. Our internal reference designs are increasingly taking advantage of our combined total system solutions approach. A comprehensive analysis of our new channels and channel partners from the Microsemi acquisition was completed, and we are making the adjustments required for an effective combined company approach. The operations integration work is an enormously complex undertaking, as little to no integration of prior Microsemi acquisitions have taken place. Because of the size of the business and the absence of ERP integration by Microsemi, the business system and operational integration will be done in phases. The first phase for one of the business units went live on November 1 successfully, further phases have been planned with the quarterly cadence of go-live events for many quarters. We expect the overall operational integration will take about two more years to complete. From a factory standpoint, the initial plans for insourcing somewhat [ph] Microsemi was outsourcing have been completed, and prioritize actions to execute these plans have commenced. In the G&A functions; we eliminated some more of the support organizational redundancies and more will happen after we get further along with our business system and operational integration plans. Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2019. I will then provide update on our progress at Microsemi. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2019. Our September quarter financial results were good. Our consolidated non-GAAP net sales came in just above the midpoint of our guidance that we issued on August 9, 2018. Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin was strong at 61.7% of sales. Microchip classic, non-GAAP operating margin was an all-time record. Consolidated non-GAAP operating profit, including Microsemi was 38.3% of sales and near the high-end of our guidance. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was an all-time record at $1.81 and near the high-end of our guidance. There was a strong EPS contribution from both, Classic Microchip and Microsemi, the accretion from Microsemi exceeded our original guidance of $0.15 for the September quarter. This was based on non-GAAP revenue which is based on distribution sell-through and is representative of real market demand. On non-GAAP basis, this was also over 112th consecutive profitable quarter. Now let me provide you some update on the progress we have made with the Microsemi integration. First to distribution inventory; we had told you last quarter that we will complete a distribution inventory reduction in two quarters, September and December. I'm pleased to report that with a lot of work by the combined teams of Microchip and Microsemi, and in cooperation with the distributors, we almost completed the inventory reduction in one quarter. The distribution inventory at the end of September was 2.62 months, down from about 4 months prior to the closing of the acquisition. This level of inventory, we believe is the level distributors need to support end market demand and is in line with the level maintained by distributors for Microchip classic business. This was accomplished without any negative impact on distribution sales out, the non-GAAP net sales from Microsemi based on direct shipments and distribution sales out was an all-time record. Second is termination of deals; since closing the Microsemi acquisition on May 29, 2018, we terminated deals, discounts and subsidies that were used prior to the acquisition in connection with sales into distribution and contract manufacturers. For example, we can sell the Aero supply assurance program concerning sales into the channel of end-of-life product. At acquisition close, there was approximately $47 million of inventory in distribution under this Aero supply assurance program. We won't take any inventory back, but we will not ship anymore into distribution under that program. We also canceled the interest subsidy there was offered to some distributors to compensate them based on the inventory they have. We also canceled the production incentive program under which there was a discount offered to contract manufacturers to take additional inventory. Cancellation of this program has had no negative impact on contract manufacturers willingness to purchase the product they need. Finally, there with a number of OEM customers that were transferred to distribution and then the inventory shipped into distribution, this resulted in lower margin for Microsemi. As of today, we have transferred many of those customers that account for about $110 million of annualized revenue back to direct customers. So overall, we are pleased that we were able to reduce some Microsemi distribution inventory very rapidly. There was one business unit, called the high reliability discrete products business unit, where the inventory at the end of June was very high at 8.6 months. At the end of September, we had brought it down to 6.7 months. We are continuing to reduce the inventory for this business unit further. The shipments are now quite linear in the four quarters prior to being acquired by Microchip, about 57% of Microsemi's quarterly sell-in revenue were shipped in the last month of the quarter. In the September 2018 quarter, only 31% of sell-in revenue from Microsemi products were shipped in the third month. Now, next is Microsemi internal inventory. It is obvious that as we reduce the distribution inventory, the inventories that Microsemi would grow substantially unless we took corrective actions in the factories and subcontractors by cutting production targets. And that is what we did, fortunately, a very large amount of Microsemi business was done from wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors. We aggressively cut wafer starts at the foundries and loadings at assembly test subcontractors. Microsemi had several small fabs and assembly locations owned by Microsemi. We cut loadings in these factories quite substantially, some of them as much as 50%. We let go temporary workers in many of these facilities and implemented temporary plant shutdowns to control inventory. Microsemi did not produce a high percentage of their production site; so the gross margin impact was fairly small. We maintained over 61% overall gross margin for Microsemi, we believe that the underloadings of the factory has got somewhat counterbalanced by the discontinuance of all the discounts. But as I have said before, the results are going to be a bit noisy for a couple of quarters. At the end of September, the overall inventory -- internal inventory at Microchip, including Microsemi was 117 days, down two days from 119 days at the end of June quarter. So we did a great job in controlling internal inventories. Now, this may seem all too easy after the fact, but there was a tremendous focus and amount of work that went into reducing the distribution inventory. And at the same time, ensuring that our internal inventory does not balloon up. We have multiple joint teams from Microchip and Microsemi, some focused on distribution inventory reduction, others focused on controlling internal factory production and others managing reduction of foundry wafer starts and assembly and test loadings. So while addressing the inventory has provided some headwind on the distribution selling driven GAAP revenue, including sales to contract manufacturers, the non-GAAP revenue for distribution, which is based on sell-through has not been affected. I'm pleased that Microsemi business achieved a record non-GAAP net sales based on end market demand. The second issue we highlighted last quarter was extravagance. In this area, we have been moving aggressively to implement Microchip's frugal expense culture. We have shutdown the executive floor at the Microsemi headquarter building, canceled the private jet account, terminated or sold many of the sport's sky boxes, canceled golf and auto racing sponsorships and substantially pruned many memberships. As we reduced inventory and spending, Microsemi business has continued to do well. This was our narrative from the beginning that Microsemi has very good engineering teams and has very good products. The customers sockets are sticky and there are good end market opportunities for the combined company. Our strategy for the better part of this decade has been to buy businesses and turn them into world-class performers in the likes of Microchip. Here, we are starting with excellent products, excellent gross margins and excellent engineering teams. With the distributor and contract manufacturing inventory reduced and with Microchip's operating expense approach, we are optimistic about achieving our long-term targets for attrition from Microsemi. So far, we are ahead of our original targets. I also want to provide you one more figure. In the September quarter, we paid $501 million of our debt. This was accomplished by squeezing all the cash out of nearly 100 subsidiaries around the world. We could not have done it without the new tax law. Despite the large debt pay down in the September quarter, the debt leverage has not moved, though, primarily because the EBITDA has dropped, driven by lower GAAP revenue of Microsemi and also some softness in the Microchip classic business. I also want to provide you update on our Classic Microchip business, all of the issues that I highlighted last quarter, that was built into our guidance essentially came true. I had described four concerns. First, long lead times for some of the passive components. This issue did affect from sales as we expected, since the customers could not complete the whole kit. Number two, tariffs. While we were one of the first to highlight the risk of tariffs and trade war, this issue investor and analyst attention during the quarter for the whole industry. We saw a significant impact on our business during the quarter due to customer concerns about tenants and we saw a significant weakening of our bookings. We believe that tariffs and related customer concerns will continue to be an issue. Number three, ZTE. We saw some impact from not being fully able to ship to ZTE for both Microchip and Microsemi, despite the release from the Justice Department, there has been some demand destruction at ZTE. And number four, Bitcoin. Our bitcoin business has essentially evaporated, it was about 1% of our business, supplying microcontrollers and power management products for the power supplies, as well as Ethernet controllers. Now, I will provide you guidance for the December quarter. The guidance we provided for the September quarter, which reflected our caution on business conditions turned out in retrospect to be spot on and was a harbinger for broader industry weakness. We continue to be cautious about the outlook for the December quarter. We see weak market conditions for automotive and industrial, our two largest markets. Automotive business is negatively impacted by emission testing bottlenecks in Europe as well as weakness in China. The industrial business is negatively impacted by tariffs. On the other hand, communication, data center and aerospace and defense businesses are seeing strength. With all this commentary, we expect our total non-GAAP net sales to be down 5% to 10% sequentially. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61% and 61.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 24.9% and 25.4% of sales and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 35.6% and 36.6% of sales. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.49 and $1.64 per share. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, inventory write-up on acquisitions and changes in distribution inventory, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis, we believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. With this operator, will you please poll for questions? [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first today from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.
Christopher Rolland: Hey guys, great quarter in light of some of the headwinds that we're having here, and great update on Microsemi as well. So Steve, maybe you can just elaborate a little bit more on some of the end markets there. You had a little bit more detail than others did perhaps on auto, maybe talk about industrial as well. And then some bright points maybe within data center and comps, maybe that's your optical business that you might be pointing to, any more details there would be great.
Steve Sanghi: If you look at the auto business, we highlighted two areas, one is, there was a new emission standard implemented in Europe, effective September 1. There was a 1-year notice on it almost from September 1 of the prior year, however, testing agencies couldn't build up the capacity to test all the car production. So there was a significant bottleneck for cars waiting to be tested which brought the European car production down. And the whole China economy has been weak due to various reasons, some incentives were taken away, the concerns about tariff in Chinese production and all sorts of other reasons, China automotive market has been weak. In the industrial area, the concerns are mainly tariffs, both driven by Chinese end products coming to U.S. which have a 10% duty today going to 25% in January. So there are a lot of people concerned about whether they will be competitive or not in selling products in U.S., and because of weak Chinese economy, industrial is weak in China too. The three markets which are doing stronger are; data center, communication, and defense and aerospace. If I take them in the reverse order, defense and aerospace, I think after years of drawing down defense spending, the defense and aerospace spending has been on the way up. And we are very broadly designed-in into essentially every single weaponry system, every single aircraft, helicopters and others; so that part of the business is doing well. The data center business, I think you probably have seen some other companies with higher exposure to data center, data center cloud, hyperscalers and all that, that part of the business has been stronger. So that business did well last quarter and is stronger relative to the automotive and industrial and other businesses. And third is the communication, I think we also see the communication business doing well.
Christopher Rolland: And you guys have talked about this potential weakness that we're seeing from most guys out there in the market a little bit earlier, some however haven't guided for much weakness at all. Do you think that perhaps they're going to see it a little bit later and you might be working through this process a little bit earlier? And then, are there any signs of stabilization in late October or early November?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we are not going to talk about what other companies have said or what may happen to other industry players. I think you should ask them. Regarding Microchip, we first saw some impact in June quarter. And what we were seeing in June based on that we had a fairly conservative guidance for the September quarter and most people didn't talk about it till the results for the September quarter. So we were four months earlier before we saw it. And that's not first time, numerous times in the past we have seen the impact of industry events about three, four months ahead of the others see it. And we seed early and we always end early. If we talk about the industry four months earlier, nobody tends to believe it, because nobody else is talking about it and you're not seeing it. And therefore we start talking about the industry, we just talked about some factors that were affecting our business. So it turned out we were correct again and everybody else saw it later. And now on the other side, we always come out earlier but whenever we tell you that, that won't get believed either because others are not seeing it yet. So we are not fully ready to talk about the other end of the cycle yet.
Operator: We'll hear next from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.
Harsh Kumar: Eric, I think you had cited a goal of 0.7 turns of delevering for I believe for this fiscal year. Can you maybe talk about if that gets impacted at all with this environment and currently based on what you're seeing? And also maybe one for Steve, and I won't ask a follow-up after this. Microchip was usually up in March, I think mostly MSCC was just all over the place. Maybe could you help us think about how we can think about modeling March just from your initial read on what you've seen in the business?
Eric Bjornholt: Sure. So I'll take the deleveraging one first and then pass it back to Steve. But we made really good progress in terms of paying down debt as both Steve and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we took down $500 million worth of total debt and on a net basis $315.5 million. So did a really good job there of using all the cash that we could to pay down debt. We will continue to use substantially all of our excess cash generations after dividends to reduce our debt levels. And we expect our net leverage to decline dramatically over the next several years. Now with the correction of the Microsemi distribution inventory having a significant impact on our EBITDA in the June and September 2018 quarters and then combining that with our guidance for the December 2018 quarter, our trailing 12 month EBITDA will have significant headwinds over the next year. And our net debt to EBITDA will not trend down as fast as we had indicated back in August, but this is a very good cash flow business, like I said, we'll continue to pay down debt, but in the current quarter we probably expect that debt paydown to be somewhere in $160 million range, a broad range should be $150 million to $200 million, but we'll have to see how things trend here over the next few quarters to give you a longer-term forecast.
Harsh Kumar: Got it.
Steve Sanghi: I'll pick-up the second question you had which was regarding the March quarter. So I remind investors that when we bought Atmel, it was not a small acquisition, either. Atmel was about 40% to half of our business. And after we integrated Atmel, we didn't understand Atmel's seasonality for a while because companies on their own, their prior seasonality was based on sell-in, however, they work for the distributors, the whole end market mix was different. And after we had Atmel for the entire year or more than a year, we fully understood the impact of Atmel seasonality on our business to be able to guide properly. Same is the situation now with Microsemi. We don't fully understand Microsemi's seasonality. We haven't had a March quarter where the Microsemi in it. And we do not consider the March quarter on a Microsemi's clot to be a meaningful indicator for us regarding seasonality because that business was managed with a selling driven mentality, with a significantly high distribution inventory, our guidance will be based on real market demand. And the end markets for Microsemi are quite different. They are stronger in defense, stronger in data centers, stronger in communication and almost no automotive, very little automotive and all that. So I'm not ready to talk about the March quarter in terms of guidance till we have some more experience on our belt in understanding their seasonality as well as being able to gauge the impact of the current correction when it is ending and how its impact would be in the March quarter.
Operator: We'll hear now from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig Ellis: I'll start with a clarification with respect to the strong performance on the Microsemi inventory cleanup in the quarter. Did that have a particular impact on any of the product segment revenues that you reported or was the impact spread about equally among MCUs, analog and other businesses?
Eric Bjornholt: So, it really did not have an impact on the sales-out activity that Ganesh talked about, breaking out by product lines. So it was really just more of correcting the inventory sitting in distribution. So I don't think there was really any end-market impact from the actions that we took.
Steve Sanghi: We basically, we haven't broken out the sell-in data by product line. We only have broken out sell-out data by product line and that did not change based on lowering the sell-in and cleaning up the inventory.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. So, I mean, we have the sell-in data in our public filings and in our 10-Q, but that doesn't really give you an indication of where the distribution inventory drain was by product line.
Craig Ellis: There were a couple of references to accretion and I just wanted to clarify, what was the exact amount of Microsemi earnings accretion in the quarter? And Steve, are you retaining all the prior synergies and accretion targets, the $300 million in synergies as well as the $0.75 plus in year one, and $8 and I believe fiscal '20 earnings?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, we're not breaking out the exact numbers of Microsemi attrition because we kind of managing it as one company, but we gave you anecdotes that the accretion in the September quarter was higher than the $0.15 for the September quarter, we had originally guided. And we feel very confident that going out of the first year, the accretion will be higher than the $0.75 that we guided and we remain committed to a longer-term accretion of earnings per share of $8 that we guided before. This is a short-term impact based on this business cycle environment, whatever one, two, three quarters at last, it doesn't really have a long-term impact over a three, four years because usually the bounce back, will get you back to where you were.
Operator: From SunTrust, we'll hear from William Stein.
William Stein: First, really more of a housekeeping one. The share count was a little lower than expected in the quarter and in the outlook. Is that just owing to a share price and the treasury method accounting for average shares in the quarter? Or is there something else going on there?
Eric Bjornholt: No, that's exactly what it is. We post a schedule on our Investor Relations page under supplemental financial information that walks through what the share count approximately would be based on various prices. As you know, we have several convertible debt instruments outstanding and the share dilution from those has gone down with the stock price falling.
William Stein: And the other is to address the GAAP to non-GAAP revenue adjustment. I think it was $81 million in the quarter. You noted that the channel inventory from Microsemi now approximates the sort of heritage Microchip business channel inventory. So it sounds like maybe there is little bit more work to do, but it's mostly done. And so, while I understand that just the inventory is going to fluctuate somewhat quarter-to-quarter after this $81 million delta that we saw in the quarter you just posted, going forward, should we expect this number to sort of fluctuate around zero or average around zero over time? Is that the right way to think about it?
Eric Bjornholt: I'll take a stab at answering that and then Steve or Ganesh can chime in. So, we're really pleased with the progress that we made in getting the Microsemi just the inventory down to 2.62 months, which is right in line with where Microchip has been historically. We really are not able to project what distributors are going to do, some of that is going to be based on environment, it's going to be based on working capital needs, it's going to be based on lead times, there are so many things that factor into it. We have 120 or so distributors that we work with worldwide. We don't manage our business in a way where we get that type of visibility from them and really we're driving for end-market demand forecast versus sell-in. When it surprise me in an environment like this, that distributors are going to be very tight with our working capital. But again, for us to be able to provide any sort of forecast of what it's going to do is quite difficult and we don't feel we have capability to do that. Steve, do you want to add anything?
Steve Sanghi: What I would add is, we do not put any effort into managing our business to put the inventory into distribution. We put our entire effort into creating market demand which pulls the inventory out of the distribution and then allow the asset managers of the distribution to buy the product they need to serve the end market demand. So as the quarter is approaching, the quarter-end is approaching, we don't look at sales out is this and sell-in is this and we got to go make another $10 million of deal. So sell-in is lower than the sell-out or to hold back product because it's going to go up or lower. We don't manage both of those numbers. We only manage one number which is sales out. And like I told you last quarter, the standard has changed, the GAAP standard is sell-in. I told you that before we disagree with it. But we have to report a GAAP sell-in number which we do, and we'll continue to do it. But all our measurements, all our bonus programs what Board manages us is to a market demand driven number that we report as a non-GAAP revenue. And sell-in would be whatever distributors want based on their own asset management, their cash flow needs, lead times, there are hundreds of things go into what they do with their inventory. And we don't manage that.
Operator: We'll hear now from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach: Steve, understanding, you don't want to talk about the March quarter and seasonality yet, just for the core business, your commentary about kind of cautious into December, what type of signals are you looking for in terms of distribution, our customers in terms of how far along we are for the correction here?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we interact with a large number of customers and distributors over the course of this quarter. And based on that collective engagement with hundreds, if not thousands of customers in all three geographies, US, Europe, Asia, we will have an assessment by the time we announce the December quarter results, which will be in early February. If there is a meaningful information that developed before that and gives us enough data points that we can kind of make a call, then we'll use the opportunity at one of the conferences to make comments on it. But fresh coming from the elections yesterday with 1% of precincts reporting, we cannot make the call on the election.
Craig Hettenbach: Understood. And I appreciate the color on the end markets, where you're seeing strength and weakness, any thoughts on consumer appliances, because that's the market that we've seen some potential slowing in China as well, do you have any thoughts there?
Ganesh Moorthy: So that part of the business appliance consumer part of the business is weak also. I cannot put it in the industrial. People who make wave conditioners and appliances and that's kind of industrial kind of business, you may call it consumer, but yes, that is we call so.
Operator: From Stifel we will hear from Kevin Cassidy.
Kevin Cassidy: With reference to China, have you seen any change in behavior on new designs where -- maybe because of the tariff and trade war if there's preference for non-US microcontrollers as an example, rather than Microchip?
Ganesh Moorthy: We haven't really seen a lot of impact in reality. There is lot of talk about it, but it's not changing the funnel size in any way, partially because very large portion of Microchip business is proprietary, such functionality with such low power or such features or performance for that really is not available in any local kind of Chinese parts, which are really fairly low end. So I don't think we have seen any meaningful difference in the funnel size or design activity. There is a lot to talk about it.
Steve Sanghi: Yes. And maybe I didn't understand the question directly, but tariff impact on our products directly is very, very small, right. It's the products that our customers are building with our products where the tariff applies. So I think it's probably too early for us to see any real impact on the design side, Kevin. If they were to use the Chinese microcontroller or analog part to build their end product appliance or washers and dryers whatever that will have duty also coming in here. So not designing a Microchip product does not abate the duty coming into US. And that is a bigger impact.
Kevin Cassidy: Right. It's just more whether it's going to anti-US, view in the design point of view, even if it's an STMicro [ph] something from Europe, rather than the US-based, that's what I was trying to get.
Steve Sanghi: I think your question is the right one and we hit that, but like I said, fortunately we're not easy to design up.
Operator: We'll hear next from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Steve, relative to the industrial weakness should calling out tariffs. I know this is probably an impossible question to answer, but I'm going to ask your opinion anyhow. To what extent do you think customers are reacting to the 10% tariff that's already been levied? And to what extent do you think that they're actually trying to be anticipatory to the raise to 25% come in the beginning of the year, I'm just trying to get a sense as to whether or not you think there's another sheer to drop or not? And then my second question, you did a great job kind of talking about the distribution inventory at Microsemi. I'm kind of curious about direct customer inventory. What did you see as the quarter unfolded? Was there any meaningful adjustments you needed to make there those behind you and to the extent they might be behind you, could there be a potential tailwind which I think you referred to on the last conference call once this inventory depletion was done.
Steve Sanghi: So let me take the first one first, which is a tariff question. So what's happening is as the percentage tariff and the products which are -- we've tariffs on keeps moving, it is kind of creating waves in customer sentiment. Originally, back in June-July time frame when there were some tariffs ready to go on in August, some people will try to get ahead of it, build the product, so they bring it to US and avoid the tariff, others will hold back production, they want to draw down their inventory, because they don't really know whether they'll be able to pass the tariff to the customers or they will agree that entire tariff. So it kind of create some waves both ways and that was for the 10% tariff. And through the quarter of September, customers were essentially cutting down production, drawing down their inventory, because they felt that it will be uncompetitive passing on the tariff to US customers who had a choice to buy the product made in Taiwan, made in Singapore, made in Vietnam, made in Mexico or wherever. And now, very recently we're hearing the talk that the expectation many of the customers had was heading toward the elections, the whole thing we're going to get settled. You may recall at the UN, Trump was talking so bad about Canada that Canada was cooperating and all that, and there may be an agreement with Mexico only. One week later they signed an agreement announced the agreement with Canada, so the thought was similarly few days before the election there will be settlement with China and so kind of people who are holding back. Well, that didn't happen. And now the feeling is I don't think the settlement is closed. So now some of the customers are thinking tariffs are going to go to 25% and we should pull in and built some of the stuff and bring to US at 10% tariff and then bringing to 25%. So you could see that the waves moving all over the place and 50,000 customers we might have in China, not all aligned. It's very noisy, it's very hard to make decisions and we had lead times are short and we're responding to every customer and they're signing as we see it. So I don't know if that answers your first question.
John Pitzer: No, that's helpful. And then just on the direct customer inventory situation of Microsemi?
Steve Sanghi: On the direct to customer, the inventory we saw on the direct customer side was with contract manufacturers, because contract manufacturers is considered OEM business, it's a direct business, it's not through distribution. There was really not much inventory in the direct customers that we saw. And we wouldn't know it either, I mean, you don't know every customers inventory, but the way the deals were made with the discounts were given were to the contract manufacturers under a program called Production Incentive Program; so we can fill that program. And as we cancel that program, contract manufacturers only started taking what they need for their needs and they drew down their inventory.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll hear next from Chris Danely with Citi.
Christopher Danely: Steve, I know you're not going to comment on March seasonality. If hypothetically speaking if March revenue was down, would you be able to keep OpEx flat to down ?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we definitely will have the March OpEx down, not even flat to down, will be down, because we are still continuing to reduce Microsemi expenses as we do integration. And if March quarter is down as we're supposing, bonuses would be lower, so bonus approval will be lower. Yes, so I would say in that situation, March expense will not be flat, they will be down.
Christopher Danely: And then for my next question, any sort of comparisons on this correction versus previous corrections? Are you seeing anything in common or this completely new?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think that's more of your department than and mine, but...
Christopher Danely: I'm just newest as you...
Steve Sanghi: In 2015, we saw this impact, I believe in August-September time frame. And we made a call I believe in late September time frame that we see China slowing down. It was driven by China and nobody else was seeing it and by -- and then when the numbers came out and numbers were cut, and they were cut again and everybody was down as much. And most stocks went down lower than they had gone down that day when we had made the call. So everybody was about four months behind. Same thing is happening this time. I think we saw that impact three to four months behind everybody else, so that is common. But what's driving it today versus what was driving it back then, I think the reasons are a little bit different, tariffs, maybe lead time becoming shorter, some are same, some are different, tariff is a new phenomenon.
Operator: We'll hear now from Vivek [ph] of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Unidentified Analyst: Steve, for the first one, can you give us some more real-time sense on production plants? Are you still looking to reduce them further versus seasonality or do you think they have kind of stabilized at these levels?
Steve Sanghi: So if you look at Chris Danely's question, you have to make an assumption on March. We cut back production quite a bit, with that, the internal inventory is in good control. We actually -- internal inventory went down by a couple of days. So, if the business is stable from here, if this quarter marks the bottom, then factory start building back slowly. If there is a further downside, which was an assumption possibly Chris was making -- I don't know if he was making that assumption, then you have to adjust to the reality.
Unidentified Analyst: And on the OpEx side, if my math is right, so you had $354 million on non-GAAP OpEx in September, I think December, you are guiding to $352 million, so kind of a flattish. Why are we not seeing more cost synergies? And -- or does it just mean we will see them later on?
Eric Bjornholt: Well, we took a lot of costs out early. I think if you were to combine the Microchip and Microsemi models from back in March or even a year ago, you're going to see that significant expense has been taken out. And that doesn't mean that there still not more to come. But I think we're actively managing that. Our OpEx came in significantly lower than our guidance for the quarter that we just completed. And we're managing based on the environment that's presented to us and I think we're doing a good job of that.
Unidentified Analyst: And just one quick housekeeping; I think, Eric, you said tax rate under 5%, I believe in the past it was between 3% to 4%. So, just for modeling purpose, should be more like 3.5% or 4.5% for the next one or two years? Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: Well, when we gave a 3% to 4% before, that was kind of the short-term and we've got now questions coming in, in terms of what it's going to be over the next few years. And it's not a perfect science to forecast this but under 5% or 5% or less is where we're at today, it's not saying it can't be 3.5% but that's a pretty tight range.
Steve Sanghi: I think you're modeling 100 plus subsidiaries around the world and varying tax rates in various countries and interest payments and deductions and all these taxes and it should kind of average of all that, it's not a perfect sound, so it can change based on mix.
Operator: Moving on to Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: The first question, I was hoping you could help us better understand some of the trade-offs that you've made with Microsemi's business now that you've had it under your wing for a longer period of time. It sounds like there's been several efforts taken to improve gross margins and I think that business had run in the low 60s on a stand-alone basis. With all the changes, some of the product pruning and that changed things along those lines, do you think it gets to above that 63 range that you're guiding for on a combined basis or that were just toward that higher end once the utilization rates normalize? And related to that, maybe you can help us think about, has there been any share shifts or the size of product pruning that you may have done given some of these changes that you're making to the business model?
Steve Sanghi: I think, Mark, one mistake most people make in looking at Microsemi gross margin is that day-to-day acquisition of a company called Vectron which closed in late November, early December timeframe. It had gross margins in the mid-30s and was $100 million revenue. And so, its impact was really never seen by investors in a non-GAAP basis. December quarter was fairly short just one month. And then March quarter, we announced the deal on March 1. So March quarter was really never fully announced based on a non-GAAP.
Mark Delaney: They filed the 10-Q?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, they filed the 10-Q.
Mark Delaney: But didn't have a conference call…
Steve Sanghi: But didn't have a conference call. So you wouldn't really know the non-GAAP margin taking away all these charges and everything else that acquisitions do. So Microsemi gross margin wasn't 63% driven by all those acquisitions margin was below 60%. And so we have already improved some and we'll continue to improve the gross margin, but looking for the gross margin to go over 63% would be quite a stretch right now.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes, so we -- as you said, have margin improvements programs that are in place and we still have confidence in the combined long-term model of 63%, this last quarter, we were at 61.7%. So it's not like we're light years away from that but --
Steve Sanghi: We got to get the factories to full production again because of the inventory correction as you ship less to distribution, all that inventory stays in house unless you cut production, so we did. And we take the under-absorption in the current quarter, we don't put it into -- we don't capitalize it into the inventory. So as the production starts going back, you will have some accretive effect on gross margin.
Mark Delaney: For the second part of that question, obviously there is a different focus on the types of businesses Microchip will be participating with there, but can you just help us think about the scope of revenue that you may not participate in any more either because you're focusing on -- and there are set of product lines, any share shifts that we should be contemplating things along those lines, so we can think about the right revenue run rate for that business once we adjust for some of these inventory dynamics that have gone on the last couple of quarters?
Steve Sanghi: We said that before we are going to keep and we like all the businesses. The combined Microsemi all businesses together, P&L is very good. There are product lines which are lower gross margin, there are product lines which are higher gross margin than average, there are product lines that grow less than average, there are product lines that are growing more than average. Microchip classic is no different. Our gross margins are lower in certain Microchip businesses but mix and match overall gross margin is excellent and that is the case with Microsemi. Every business is accretive and we're not going to offload a business just because it's a lower gross margin than the average. If it's accretive and growing and adding and providing additional attach is a part of the total system solution. So if all the other things are working, then it's a good Microchip product.
Eric Bjornholt: And every business unit leader that we have is tested and not just growing the revenue but improving their gross margin and operating margins over time. And within the Microchip system, we work together to make that happen.
Operator: We'll move next to Krysten Sciacca with Nomura.
Krysten Sciacca: I just wanted to follow-up on the OpEx question from before. It looks like the OpEx from this quarter came in a little bit lower than expected. And I'm just wondering if that was just due to better than expected execution on synergies or was there something else, going on in the quarter there that we should be thinking about?
Steve Sanghi: There was nothing else going on. Although, we would say that since we saw the effect of this downturn coming much earlier than anybody else, we hunker down earlier. We can sell majority of the open wrecks, we cut back on capital, we canceled firm orders that we had in capital to the extent we were able to cancel them and that's we slipped them out. We hunker down and we kind of batten down the hatches.
Eric Bjornholt: We ask our employees to treat the spending as if it's their own money and do that on a global basis and it has very good results. So I think Steve is right. We just got out ahead of this quicker.
Krysten Sciacca: And then just moving to the inventory question from Microsemi and how you completed that about a quarter earlier, then you stated on the prior call for the most part. What exactly caused that faster, that correction to happen faster than expected? Was there something in particular that Microchip did, or was it just better end demand, or what was kind of driving that for us?
Steve Sanghi: I think, especially when you buy new business, you're in lot to learn for that business. You're getting to know the people that are concerned with employees regarding what Microchip could do with various businesses. Let me get this in, various analysts write about various businesses that we will sell out, we should sell; and I always ask you please don't do that because you create problem for us. The employees of that business read those reports and they get concerned that their business is maybe sold or not get focused on. And we have said that we're going to keep all the businesses, but every time you look at, some analysts will make this speculation why data center business doesn't fit with Microchip or Opto business doesn't fit with Microchip or something else doesn't Microchip; all that does is creates concern for our customers and creates concern for our employees. So what I'm saying is; we are working very hard on all these items, learning the businesses, keeping the customers at peace, talking to the employees, learning the inventory, and when such a large challenge comes up like the inventory, then it just takes an enormous amount of energy forming the teams and focusing the teams to go clean up the inventory. It also depends on how in the mix that inventory was. If that inventory was highly out of mix then you have to continue to ship additional products for which there is demand, and if there is lot of slow moving inventory that we call sludge, then that will take much longer time. And in certain business units, the inventory was in good mix, in certain other business units, inventory was not as good of a mix. So basically, huge amount of work, the combined teams are working together, creating a goal for everybody to clean up this inventory faster than the two quarters we guided to and I think that's where we are. And also working and getting cooperation from the distributors. It's just lot of groundwork, there is not much magic there, it's just a lot of hard work.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. And as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks, there is still a business unit or two, that's inventory is higher than we'd like it to be and it will come down overtime. And there may be a business unit or two, that's inventory is too low, and these things kind of balance each other out. So we think at 2.6 months, we're in a very good position today.
Steve Sanghi: And in this business unit, number one, the inventory is very high over 8.6 months. Clearly, there was a lot of excess inventory and when you build that much inventory, then inventory also tends to age and gets out of mix, we shipped such a high amount of inventory and customer demand shifts. So lot of the inventory then becomes very slow moving and takes time to correct.
Eric Bjornholt: I guess I'll give kudos to all the business units that were involved, the sales and distribution organization, our distributors, the planning folks, that goes with this, just -- it was a very large team, and everybody did a good job of executing.
Steve Sanghi: There was also $110 million of product that we shifted back from distribution to direct and customer-by-customer and distributor-by-distributor, whichever the pair was, the distributor shipping to customer, you had to go -- work that relationship and convince a customer and convince a distributor, distributor going to lose that business to direct customer will ship it directly, makes sure distributor cleans out their inventory, so the new business and Microchip ships and creating accounts for those customers, receivables, learning where the product has to be shipped some places, sometime it goes into hubs of distributors, sometimes there are multiple locations, all that challenging task by the shipping teams and marketing teams and sales teams; it's just purely a guess when we first talked to you regarding how long would it take. I have to tell you two quarters and get it done in one quarter, rather than tell you one quarter and takes two quarters.
Krysten Sciacca: Understood. Thanks, guys.
Operator: From Raymond James, we'll go to Chris Caso.
Chris Caso: Just a question with regard to customer inventory levels, and I'd say, it's probably more pertains to the Microchip classic business. How much of the slowdown that you're seeing now, do you attribute to some of the demand function, issues that you talked about as opposed to just customers holding too much inventory and typically when we've seen the slowdowns in the past, it's some combination of the two, do you think about it any differently at this time around?
Steve Sanghi: Well, when customer buys less product, you're unable to differentiate whether that's a purely inventory correction or his demand is slower. It always tends to be a combination. If you're building a 100,000 widgets a week, then you have certain amount of inventory at you're loading dock, in your factory floor, some in raw material, some in work in process, a certain amount of inventory. If your demand drops, because of your tariff concerns, let's say, you only want to build a 90,000 widgets, then the entire inventory in your structure divided by 90 is going to become more weeks of inventory than at 100. And then when you draw it down, you could call it inventory correction, you can call it because of the lower demand, I don't know how you separate it.
Chris Caso: Understood. As a follow-up, if you could talk about the linearity of your order rate as you proceeded through the quarter and into October. And I assume that that the order rates have slowed down since we last spoke in August, but have they sort of step down to a certain level and then stabilize that level given the uncertainty about tariffs and such, you spoke about or did they continue to worsen on a month-on-month basis?
Steve Sanghi: The order rate slowed down and stayed pretty constant at the lower level and have recently bounced back, partially because lead times are fairly short, so they got to place the orders for December and January. They don't need to place orders for next June, but they do need to place the orders for the next quarter. So the order rate, as you said, slowed down, but has recently bounced back up.
Chris Caso: In the month of October?
Ganesh Moorthy: In the month of October, yes.
Operator: We will hear next from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Just wondering on deleveraging, how you changed, are you accelerating that? What's -- how are you looking at that?
Eric Bjornholt: So I tried to answer that on an earlier question, but essentially our deleveraging is going to be at a slower pace than what we had originally guided to the Street. We've got headwinds of very low EBITDA in both June and September, due to discretion inventory reduction. We were having a down quarter this year at the midpoint of guidance. We're going to be down 7.5%. And that just have an impact and is going to stay with us now for 12 months, because this debt calculations or EBITDA calculations are all 12 month trailing. So the cash flow from the business is going to be high, but if you look at our accounts receivable balance, it's down $120 million quarter-on-quarter, and that translates to cash. So it's going to take us some time, but all of our cash, really all our significant cash in excess of what we need to run the business and pay dividends is going to be used to pay down debt. And with that, we will reduce the debt balance, but the EBITDA is going to be something that sticks with us for the next year.
Unidentified Analyst: Getting fast some of the near-term tariff issues, the lack of visibility into the March quarter and first half, let's say, any thoughts, concerns on microcontroller has been, especially as you look at automotive where does content go? And just wondering -- just want to get your thoughts on how you look at that? Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh, you want to take that?
Eric Bjornholt: Ganesh, had to run to catch a flight.
Steve Sanghi: Oh, he had to catch a flight. So I think we are not concerned about the long-term prospects of microcontroller, analog or any of our businesses. Our fundamental frame is being able to sell total system solution into a customer socket, whether it's automotive, whether it's industrial, with microcontroller, analog connectivity products Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, LoRa. And now where there are lots of Microsemi products, including discrete products, FEPS and diodes and RF and other products. I think, there is fundamentally no concern about long-term Microchip, and the design win funnel and all that, are very, very healthy. I think, we're just talking about this impact, some from the tariff, and some from the slowdown in the business. You could go back, there was an earlier question, how it is different, or same as the 2015 cycle? And in that 2015 cycle, some of the assumptions were, like this thing is over. The industry just goes away, and all these things don't get designed in, and you can see how the business bounced back, and we had record quarters and record years and outstanding market share gains and everything else. So there is no long-term concern here, it's a short-term.
Operator: We'll hear next from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Maybe just touching on some of the pockets of strength in the business. In aerospace and defense, it's obviously very sticky, very high profitability segment; it sounds like near-term it's kind of doing well. In order for you guys to sort of take advantage of this very profitable area, how much effort is required to get your MCU and analog products Mil/Aero, Rad Hard qualify, is there a lot of work to be done here? Or is the core Microchip team already engaged in cross-selling?
Steve Sanghi: So there is a lot of work underway. There was a small aerospace and defense business that we have acquired as part of the Atmel acquisition which was headquartered in France. And they did business largely with French aerospace companies, and didn't have any market share in U.S. And after acquiring them, in the last year and a half or so, we've been putting efforts, we expanded the charter to take Microchip standard microcontroller, analog and memory products, and make them Rad Hard, recharacterize them to the needs of military and aerospace with broad temperature ranges and all that. So all that work has been underway for the last two year or so in militarizing our products. Microsemi brings even just a much, much higher level of expertise in that area, and about 10x to 15x larger business than Atmel had in aerospace and defense. So in our integration, we have combined the Atmel's aerospace and defense business together with the microspace, aerospace and defense business as one business unit. And that business unit is accelerating, taking Microchip products to market in that segment. So that effort is about a year old, and is really getting significant boost right now. But we're not shipping core Microchip products in military for revenue today. Any Microchip products going into aerospace and defense sector, are still standard commercial products that are bought from distributors, and just kind of use standard commercial product. In some non-sensitive applications, aerospace and defense is allowed to use standard commercial products. The military products, rad-hard products, is an effort under way, but it's not making revenue today.
Harlan Sur: And then in the FPGA segment, you guys drove record revenues, obviously the Microsemi team built a strong Mil/Aero leadership franchise there. And I think Ganesh talked about some of the new opportunities with the mid-range PolarFire family, which is more for kind of like multi-market applications, but sounds like overall the business is doing well. Can you guys just give us a sense on how strongly the FPGA business is growing on a year-over-year basis?
Steve Sanghi: So, I don't have a year-over-year comparison, some, but it won't be valid, because it will be a sell-in by putting in your high channel inventory versus sell-through that we're measuring. So that's why we said based on a sell-through basis, the numbers were a record. It was all-time record. And I don't have a year-over-year comparison, since we haven't had the business for a year. But the business is doing very well. It's doing very well in defense and aerospace, it's doing very well in the multi-market. It has a very good design and funnel. The next-generation architecture, which is Gen5, is just going into market and just introducing at the sample level. And there is a significant demand pull on that. So I think we are very optimistic about that business.
Operator: We'll go next to Jefferies' Mark Lipacis.
Mark Lipacis: Steve, a number of the contract manufacturers with the global footprint, have talked about some of their customers already shifting manufacturing outside of China and accelerated core activity with our customers to do as much. I was wondering, if you were noticing that any evidence or anecdotes on that front? And to the extent that you think that might be causing some near-term disruption? That's all I had. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: You're very correct. We are seeing that, too. So two things are happening. One, if there are two sources of production, one in China and one outside of China, then some attempt is being made to take the Chinese production and sell it to Europe and Asia, and take the non-Chinese production and ship it to U.S. This way you can optimize and not pay any duties. Two challenges in that; number one, it's lot of manual work and most people aren't set up to really differentiate the product where it should go, but manually, and then writing some automation, it's really being done. But it's not perfect, because in many cases the U.S. demand is not exactly equal to the non-Chinese production, and Europe and Asia demand isn't equal to Chinese production, so there are still problems. So to solve that problem, you're correct, there are many customers that are moving Chinese production to outside of China, but they are rapidly running into capacity issues. Where the outside factories are full, there was a little bit space, and they're now full, and there is lot more to be transferred from China but there is no place to put it till they really expand capacity, build more square footage and all that, and that's a slow process. So, yes, we're seeing that.
Operator: And at this time, I'd like to turn things back to Steve Sanghi for any closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: We want to thank all of our customers and analysts for your patience and for your understanding. I think this has been a tough four months here, but I think we've done a lot of good work in cleaning up the Microsemi inventory. And at the same time, it's really the first acquisition whose timing was such that the wind is not on our back, we did number of other acquisitions and the timing was great. Here, along with the Microsemi inventory challenges we're also facing this downturn in the business, and so we're dealing with the dual challenges. But I think we posted a pretty good quarter, and despite sequentially down guidance, I think we're managing the inventory very well, the internal inventories in very good shape. Overall, gross margin and operating margins are still very, very good. And we look forward to really getting through these issues and getting back to our long-term $8 earnings target. So, thank you very much.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you all for joining us.

===== 2019 Q1  (2018-08-10 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to this Microchip Technology First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2019 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and provide an update on our integration activities associated with the Microsemi acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our Web site at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I want to remind investors that during the quarter ending June 30, 2018, we adopted a new GAAP revenue recognition standard which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy where revenue on such transactions were deferred until the product was sold by our distributors to an end customer. We are not able to provide guidance on a GAAP basis as we are not able to predict whether inventory at our distributors will increase or decrease in relation with end market demand as this is not how we manage our business. As evidence of this uncertainty in recent years, we have seen net inventory at our distributors increase or decrease by a significant amount in a single quarter. Our non-GAAP revenue is based on true end market demand in which we measure the revenue based on when the product is sold by our distributors to an end customer. We will continue to manage our business and distributor relationships based on creating and fulfilling end market demand. All of Microchip’s bonus programs will continue to work based on the amount of revenue earned from fulfilling end market demand. Therefore, along with GAAP results based on sell-in, we will also report our non-GAAP results based on sell-through revenue recognition. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis using revenue based on end market demand and expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the June quarter were 1.217 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 21.4% sequentially from net sales of 1.002 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our Website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 62.2%, operating expenses were 23.3% of sales, and operating income was a record 473.5 million and 38.9% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was a record 405.8 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $1.61, which was $0.13 above the midpoint of our guidance of $1.48. On a GAAP basis, net sales in the June quarter were 1.213 billion, GAAP gross margins were 52.9% and include the impact of 3.6 million of share-based compensation, 107.7 million of acquisition restructuring and acquired inventory evaluation costs, and 3.4 million impact from changes in distributor inventory levels. Total operating expenses were 509.7 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of 133.7 million, special charges of 40.1 million which includes 15.9 million of share-based compensation, 26.9 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of 25.8 million. The GAAP net income was 35.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share. The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 3.5% in the June quarter. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal '19 and the next several years to be between 3% and 4%, exclusive of a transition tax and any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses, tax credits and interest deductions that will keep our cash tax payments low. The transition tax for the combined Microchip- Microsemi group is expected to be about 364 million, was recorded last fiscal year and will be paid over eight years. The first transition tax payment was made in July 2018 in the amount of $35 million. We expect payments of about 28 million in fiscal years 2020 through 2023, 54 million in fiscal year 2024, 72 million in fiscal 2025 and 91 million in fiscal year 2026. Microchip’s GAAP tax rate in the June quarter was 5.2% and was impacted by the various GAAP purchase accounting adjustments from the Microsemi acquisition and prior acquisitions as well as one-time discrete benefits related to changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2018 was 1.105 billion including 359.7 million of inventory mark-up from Microsemi required for GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the inventory mark-up, we had 119 days of inventory at the end of the June quarter. Our targeted inventory levels are between 115 and 120 days. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter were at 40 days compared to 36 days at the end of March. The historical Microchip distributor inventory was actually down by about a day in the June quarter, but the consolidated increase is driven by the high inventory in the Microsemi distribution channel. We expect the Microsemi distribution inventory to reduce through the end of calendar year 2018. The cash flow from operating activities was 302.4 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was 649.7 million. At June 30, our debt outstanding includes 3.3 billion of borrowings under our line of credit, $3 billion of term loan B, $2 billion of high-grade bonds and $4.5 billion of convertible debt. Our net debt to EBITDA, excluding our very long dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 5.0 at June 30, 2018. Our leverage is higher than we originally projected primarily due to lower EBITDA from the Microsemi business driven by needing to correct distribution inventory levels through lower shipment activity. We are fully committed to using 100% of our excess cash generation beyond our dividend payments to reduce our debt levels and we expect our net leverage to decline dramatically over the next several years. Capital expenditures were 89.4 million in the June 2018 quarter. We expect about 70 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 to be about 220 million to 250 million. We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margin improvements to our business, particularly for the Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $38 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter and provide an update on some of the Microsemi integration activities. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get started with the product line discussion, I thought it may be helpful to summarize what we said at our May 31st conference call in regards to our revenue reporting. Classic Microchip, which is Microchip excluding Microsemi, used to report five product lines; microcontrollers, analog, memory, licensing and finally multi-market and other, what we used to call MMO. In fiscal year 2018, our revenue of 3.98 billion was split across the five product lines as follows; microcontrollers at 65.8%, analog at 23.9%, memory at 5%, licensing at 2.6% and MMO at 2.6%. With the addition of Microsemi, we will add a sixth product line category called FPGA. Microsemi’s revenue reporting will be split across four of the six product line categories; in microcontrollers, analog, FPGA and MMO. Microsemi has no memory or licensing product lines and hence the contribution to these categories will be zero. Directionally, on a combined basis, we expect our analog revenue percentage to tick up while our microcontroller revenue percentage will tick down. That’s exactly what the final results for FQ1 have shown with a partial quarter of Microsemi results included in our overall results. Now let’s get to the product line performance. On a combined company basis, we performed a little better than we expected in the June quarter with sequential revenue growth of 21.4% as compared to the March quarter. Microchip, excluding Microsemi, achieved a new record for revenue. The Microchip 2.0 transformation continues to make good progress especially in terms of new design opportunities as we enable our clients’ innovation with the very best smart, connected and secure solutions. Taking a closer look at microcontrollers, our microcontroller business, excluding Microsemi, set a new record in the June quarter. Microcontroller revenue, excluding Microsemi, also outgrew classic Microchip overall. Both 8-bit microcontrollers and 32-bit microcontrollers for classic Microchip set new records. On a combined basis, including Microsemi, our microcontroller business was sequentially up 10.8% as compared to the March quarter. Our microcontroller portfolio and roadmap has never been stronger and we are seeing continued growth in our design and funnel which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share in 2018 as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Now moving to our analog business, our analog revenue, excluding Microsemi, set a new record in the June quarter. Analog revenue, excluding Microsemi, also outgrew classic Microchip overall. And on a combined basis, our analog business was sequentially up 35% as compared to the March quarter. Moving next to our licensing business, this business was sequentially up 0.2% as compared to the March quarter and up 5.8% as compared to the year-ago quarter. Our memory business was sequentially down 1.8% in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. And finally, our MMO business for Microchip, excluding Microsemi, was down sequentially. However, it was up 63% sequentially when including Microsemi. On a combined company basis, which has a full quarter of Microchip and a partial quarter of Microsemi, our FQ1 2019 revenue of 1.2 billion was split across the six product lines we report as follows; microcontrollers at 59.9%, analog at 27%, FPGA at 3.4%, memory at 4%, licensing at 2.2% and MMO at 3.5%. We expect the tick down in microcontroller revenue percentage and tick up in analog revenue percentage will be further extenuated when we announce our FQ2 results in November as we will have a full quarter of Microsemi revenue included in the results. Now an update on the Microsemi integration and our progress since our May 31st conference call. We made dramatic changes to the top level leadership structure in the first few weeks after the close. Essentially, all of the top leadership are no longer with Microchip. The reasons for this will be more evident after Steve provides you some color in his section. As we have done in other large acquisitions, we have used our leadership depth and strong pipeline to insert Microchip executive leaders in the top positions to run the Microsemi enterprise. The business unit restructuring is progressing well. We have retained several of the key Microsemi business unit leaders to continue to run their businesses, while selectively combining some of the smaller businesses where Microchip had similar product lines into the Microchip business unit structure. This eliminates duplicate infrastructure and creates synergy in the process. We have also restructured some of the less profitable businesses and adjusted their going forward investment levels to be consistent with what is affordable. And we have some more to go. The sales integration has commenced. We have converted the sales team to a Microchip style non-commission sales team and ended all incentives discount product for quarter end revenue maximization. Teams from classic Microchip and Microsemi have started to identify and pursue product cross-selling opportunities and have also identified reference designs that can take advantage of our combined total solutions approach. Several of the sales office space consolidations have already taken place and many more are in the works. The normal analysis of effectiveness of channels as well as of each channel partner is underway. One decision we have already made which was announced last week is a refranchising of Avnet, a Microsemi product thus adding more channel bandwidth to sell Microsemi’s products. The operations integration work has started but it is an enormously complex undertaking as little to no integration of prior Microsemi acquisitions had taken place. For example, Microsemi has 21 ERP installations that we need to converge in our business system and operation integration plans. We expect to have the plan worked out by the end of this month and start working towards specific business system and operational integration goals at that time. However, given the complexity we are seeing, we expect the operational integration will be a two to three-year project. We’re also performing a detailed analysis of what outsourced operations can be in-sourced as well as evaluating the efficiency and cost effectiveness of Microsemi’s internal factories. Lastly, the normal task of working with the supplier base to find the best cost from either company and applying it to the other is happening as we speak. In the G&A areas, we have eliminated some of the support organizational cost redundancies. More will happen after we get further along with our business system and operational integration plans. Let me now pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2019. I will then provide commentary on our first two months at Microsemi. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2019. Our June quarter financial results were good. Our consolidated net sales came in above the midpoint of our revised guidance that we issued on May 31, 2018 after the closing of the Microsemi transaction. In discussion with our Board of Directors, the Board wants us to manage as a combined business from day one, not breakout the individual components of Microchip and Microsemi and proceed to integrate the businesses together at a rapid pace. The Board does not want to engage in the old controversy of organic versus inorganic growth and wants to measure us on the overall results achieved. What we are driving towards is to produce an increasing non-GAAP earnings per share from the combined company. This worked well when we acquired Atmel and it should work well here. Therefore, we will not provide a breakdown of the two businesses other than some useful nuggets of information along the way. I will refer to Microchip business without Microsemi as classic Microchip. When we include Microsemi, we will call it consolidated. So our classic Microchip’s non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margins were all new records last quarter. Our overall consolidated non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP EPS were also new records. Non-GAAP EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.61, $0.13 better than the midpoint of our guidance. $0.05 of this EPS beat came from higher operating profits and the balance $0.08 of the EPS beat came from a much lower tax rate. Our tax rate guidance was intentionally conservative in the wake of new tax laws and significant uncertainty of the tax rate of the combined company after acquisition of Microsemi. We consider the tax planning for the combined company to be a part of our plan to synergy and had intentionally modeled for it in our synergies planning. On a non-GAAP basis, this was also our 111th consecutive profitable quarter. Our inventories at classic Microchip at the end of June 2018 were 119 days which is right at our target of 115 to 120 days. The total inventory, including Microsemi, is cluttered by purchase accounting adjustments where inventory is written up to market value and hence the total inventory indictor is not meaningful. We have made enormous progress on the manufacturing side by bringing capacity online and decreasing lead times. Our lead times are now near normal with the majority of our products having lead times up between four to eight weeks, but scattered issues with certain products continue to cause longer lead times in those products. Now let us shift gears. I will give you our observation from our first two months at Microsemi. This has been the time when we are able to get access to all the company’s information that we were not able to get before. And this is the time when we discover some of the weaknesses that we have found in other acquisitions like Atmel and Micrel. This is typically the low point in the acquisition. Things usually rapidly improve from here as we go to work to fix things and integrate. In the case of Microsemi, we found that Microsemi management was extremely aggressive in shipping inventory into the distribution channel. Microsemi’s distributors had about four months of inventory whereas Microchip’s distributors carry about two and a half months of inventory. While we have seen some excess shipments of inventory into the distribution channel in other acquisitions, we have never seen as much excess as we found in the case of Microsemi. Microsemi also over-shipped into the contract manufacturers by making deals and offering discounts. This excessive distribution in contract manufacturers’ inventory will provide some headwind for revenue for the next couple of quarters. Our trailing EBITDA in the next two quarters of cash generation will also be impacted by needing to correct this inventory for Microsemi products. While excessive shipments into distribution and contract manufacturers has been the main issue at Microsemi, we also found a culture of excessive extravagance and high spending. The company had millions of dollars of sponsorships in several luxury suites in sports stadiums, luxury private plane travel and generous sponsorships for many conferences, stadiums and other venues that are wastage of shareholders’ money. We are undoing commitments to all such spending. So what are we doing to clean up excess inventory and other spending? We did not make any deals with the distribution and contract manufacturers or end customers in the month of June to shift excess inventory. As a result, we shipped closed to $100 million less in the month of June than Microsemi ex-management would have shipped. That was nearly half the inventory correction accomplished in a single month. We expect to achieve the balance of the distribution inventory correction in the next two quarters and nearly complete the correction by the end of this calendar year. Based on high inventory in distribution as well as inside Microsemi, we have substantially cut back on the manufacturing built plan in internal factories as well as foundries and assembly test subcontractors. The vast majority of Microsemi business is subcontracted so we will see a dollar for dollar cash saving which will offset the negative cash impact of – some of the negative cash impact of inventory correction. While this may seem disappointing, we have seen such challenges before as the problems of the acquired company become more visible post close. We remain optimistic about the medium and longer-term prospects from the Microsemi acquisition and are not changing our longer-term thesis. We have high confidence in the $300 million of synergies that we’ve previously communicated. Microsemi has a very good engineering team. We are still very bullish on the Microsemi products, the stickiness of the customers’ pockets and the end market opportunities for the combined company. Our strategy for the better part of this decade has been to buy underperforming assets and turn them into world-class performers in the likes of Microchip. Here, we are starting with excellent products and excellent gross margins and we will correct the aggressive distribution and contract manufacturing shipments and high expense culture as we have done before, for example, at Atmel. Now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. In addition to the headwinds I described on Microsemi, there are several small factors that are starting to impact the business. Standalone, none of them will be material but all of them together are causing us to provide a cautious guidance for fiscal second quarter of 2019. I would describe four reasons. Number one, the lead times in the market for some of the passive components continue to be long. We are seeing push-outs by several customers because they cannot complete the whole kit and hence do not need our devices. Number two, all the talk about tariffs and trade war is making our customers nervous. While it is hard to put your finger on it, it is hurting business confidence which makes people pull back on investments, expansion and capital spending. A very small portion of products are made in China and even a smaller portion are imported back in U.S. So we are not worried about duties on our products imported into U.S., but we are concerned about our customers’ products imported into U.S. This is based on original July 6th tariff implementation. We are still analyzing the impact of expected August 23 tariff implementation. There was a quote from one of our sources, one of our customers. “United States imposed 25% tariffs on some Chinese goods on July 6. U.S. issued a list of thousands of Chinese goods for the new tariffs. It makes manufacturers conservative in building product due to uncertainty of market demand.” Third point, we are seeing the impact of not being fully able to ship to ZTE. While the Justice Department is now allowing shipments to ZTE, ZTE is still organizing and figuring out what the real demand is now and if they can assemble the entire build of materials with long lead times on passive components. So despite the release from the Justice Department, there has been some demand destruction at ZTE. Number four, Microchip is a supplier to bitcoin mining industry by supplying microcontrollers and powered management products for the power supplies as well as Ethernet controllers. Bitcoin values have crashed. It has lowered the demand for new shipments to the bitcoin industry quite substantially. With all this commentary, we expect total non-GAAP net revenue in the September quarter to be between 1.474 billion to 1.55 billion. Our best estimate for overall non-GAAP gross margin is between 61.3% and 61.9% of sales, a range wider than normal as we integrate and understand Microsemi as well as deal with the excess inventory in the channel and resultant reduction in the internal factory builds. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 23.6% and 24.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 37.1% and 38.2% of sales. And we expect a non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.65 and $1.83 per share. This includes more than the $0.15 of accretion from Microsemi that we had originally guided to. So you can see that despite a significant headwind on Microsemi’s revenue and cautious guidance, our non-GAAP EPS guidance at the midpoint is well above prior consensus analysts’ estimates. This reflects our rapid pruning of some underperforming product lines, raising some prices on mature products and significant restructuring already at Microsemi. Our guidance also represents some excellent tax planning resulting in a lower effective cash tax rate. Our synergy assumptions included this tax planning for the combined company. We do expect our financial results to be a bit noisy for a couple of quarters as we correct distribution and subcontractor inventories and as we adjust the internal manufacturing based on inventory correction. But our synergy assumptions for fiscal year '19 and our long-term synergy assumption of $300 million and our fiscal year '21 non-GAAP EPS target of $8 per share have not changed. The target for non-GAAP EPS of $8 per share in fiscal year '21 may in fact seem conservative in light of the progress we have made in integration and a much lower effective cash tax rate. And we expect to exceed the $0.75 accretion guidance that we have provided as the annualized run rate accretion for the first year after close. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, inventory write-up on acquisitions and changes in distribution inventory, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide a more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call. With this operator, will you please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We’ll take our first question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Go ahead, sir.
Harsh Kumar: Hi. Thanks. Steve, it seems like you guys are going through the normal things when you acquire a company. Steve, I had a quick question for you and a follow up. You mentioned a lot of things that are coming into play; bitcoin, some other stuff, trade wars. I’m curious, does your guidance on the top line take into account obviously the Microsemi inventory clearing, but is there also a slowdown in your organic business or is it mostly all Microsemi that’s being played out in your revenue guide?
Steve Sanghi: We’re not breaking it out but it’s a combination. The bitcoin exposure was on the Microchip side. ZTE exposure was mostly on the Microsemi side. If there is any kind of demand slowdown because of tariffs if the customers would be nervous to drawdown their inventories because they do not know what the tariffs would be to bring the product into U.S., then that would really affect both sides, Microchip as well as Microsemi. So it’s really a combination of it. But a fair amount of correction really is on the Microsemi side.
Harsh Kumar: Got it, Steve. And then for my follow up, your margins in the September guide are slightly lower than your margins what you reported in June. I’m assuming that that’s predominantly a function of you guys taking down the Microsemi inventory quite hard down in the channel? And then how do you – you said you cleared 50% in one month. Do you expect the rest to be cleared evenly or you’re going to come down pretty hard in September again and then sort of ease-off with very little left in December?
Steve Sanghi: So several questions, let’s take the margin first. Microsemi margins are lower than Microchip’s classic margins. Many investors and analysts may have forgotten that Microsemi acquired a company called Vectron back in September, and that company only had a little over 30% gross margin. So that brought the gross margins low, but during all this time, they had been sort of in the acquisition, so they never reported – Microsemi never reported their March quarter when their margins were impacted by Vectron and prior quarter was some sort of ratio.
Eric Bjornholt: Just to clarify, that acquisition was in the November-December timeframe of 2017, not in September.
Steve Sanghi: Okay, so I stand corrected and that makes my point actually better. So since it was in the November-December timeframe, the first full quarter of the lower Vectron margin would represent itself in the March quarter and March quarter was never reported by Microsemi anyway because they were already in acquisition. So we are seeing lower gross margins of Microsemi. So last quarter was only one month and this quarter we have the entire quarter. So therefore it has a larger impact of the lower gross margin. And this quarter we will also see the impact of substantial reduction of the build rates in the internal factories of Microsemi, but that was the answer on the gross margin side. The other part of your question was --
Eric Bjornholt: Distribution correction --
Steve Sanghi: Distribution correction. So roughly the $100 million less that we shipped was a combination of shipments, lower shipments from distribution to contract manufacturers and also to direct customers because they were essentially equal opportunity making deals with everybody and making – shipping excess product into every channel. So out of the $100 million a good portion, more than half of that was a correction in distribution. We will see another distribution correction in the September quarter and the December quarter. And right now we are expecting that that will complete the majority of the correction. The largest piece got done last month, in the month of June, and then the September and December will be two roughly equal pieces. And if anything is left after that, it’s kind of a tail, a very, very small portion here and there which will not be meaningful.
Harsh Kumar: Understood. Thanks, Steve and guys and best of luck.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next we’ll hear from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Good afternoon, Steve, thanks for letting me ask the question. Steve, I just wanted to go back to yours and the Board decision not to kind of break out Microsemi. I think that makes a lot of sense looking several quarters out, especially because you’re so confident in the revenue synergies of this transaction that you included it in the initial synergy targets. But as you kind of think about the June and September quarter, if you can just help me understand the rationale of not telling us what Microsemi was, and to the extent that you’re not, can you help us get some comfort level about how the classic Microchip business is performing relative to peers because in the absence of kind of not being able to do that math, I think it’s pretty easy for some of us to perhaps wrongfully conclude that maybe the core Microchip business just isn’t holding up as well as some of your peers in this environment.
Steve Sanghi: Well, John, I’m not surprised to get that question from you. Really rightly day one, we took our guy who runs our networking business and he took over the Ethernet business and all those products are combined and we’re getting a single forecast from that division. Similarly, the case with our analog products, power management products, and others. I think if you go back to the Atmel scenario, if we had managed the business to look at Atmel’s 8-bit MCUs and Microchip’s 8-bit MCUs and Atmel’s 32-bit MCUs and Microchip’s and [indiscernible] products and automotive and others, we probably wouldn’t have got an as good results in Atmel as we were able to get, because we went at it as it’s really one business, shipped the lowest cost product at the highest ASP, wherever you have the best specs and best product and that’s really what we’re doing here. We just don’t want to spend and the Board doesn’t want to spend any of company’s energy to do it any other way. I think the Microchip business was fine and the Microsemi business was fine. One month can’t tell the story because the business was very nonlinear. So even though you’re looking at overall we achieved the numbers and slightly better than the guidance, both pieces were in the range, so basically not a problem. But reporting it is just like a slippery slope than – honestly, John, what you guys would like is really there are two clean spreadsheets; one and the other and everything adds up and two plus two is equal to 4.00000. And the world is too complex on our side. We got too many moving parts and things are moving too fast and this whole inventory correction got shoved on us from Microsemi that we were not aware of. There was so much inventory and the Board doesn’t want to put the energy on what doesn’t add value in us really driving the business.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful, Steve. And then you kind of updated or sort of reiterated a lot of the accretion targets around Microsemi. I’m just kind of curious given that there are some concerns about the leverage on the balance sheet relative to this deal, can you just give us an update on how we should think about leverage going forward and how aggressively you’re thinking about taking that leverage down? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Certainly. Eric can point that out to the leverage.
Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our leverage on a net basis, excluding a very long dated convertible, was 5.0 at the end of June. We had originally guided that we have about a turn reduction per year. And because of the distribution and inventory correction that we need to make, we think that in that first year we’re going to be somewhere in the 0.75 range in terms of reduction and then get back to the one turn per year. So it’s a little bit slower pace. And absolutely we are focused on deleveraging the balance sheet and using 100% of our excess cash generation beyond the dividend to pay down debt. So it’s a focus area of ours. We know that we have a lot of leverage at this point in time but we’re committed to bring it down.
Steve Sanghi: That reduction from one turn to 0.7 turns is largely because of shortage of the next two quarters. When you look at on the LTM basis a year from now, the September quarter and December quarter are going through substantial inventory correction, there is a shortage of the EBITDA. After that we get back to --
John Pitzer: That’s helpful, guys. Thanks for the details as always.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. First, I know in the past you have evaluated potential divestitures. I wonder in this case if you think that evaluation continues. Is it more or less likely than in the past? You highlight this lower margin Vectron business. Is there anything that you might want to divest? And then I have a follow up, please.
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think we always evaluate thing when we buy a company. And as you have seen in our prior acquisition, we have really divested very little. There was a tiny small piece out of the Atmel, there was nothing out of Standard Microsystems, there was nothing out of Micrel, nothing out of Supertex. We look at divesture more driven by it doesn’t fit at all rather than it isn’t performing well or it’s lower margin, because we fix margins. We fix pricing – increase pricing. We adjust the model mix of the products. We move the product into different set of customers, industrial or automotive and others where the margins maybe higher. We have done that in many, many acquisitions and we’ll do similar things here. The acquired company focus or the reach may be in a certain set of customers and we expand that and improve margins. So, so far we have not found anything we are going to divest but it’s only been a couple of months and that’s not where we are focused on, divesting. We are focused on improving.
William Stein: Thanks. And as a follow up, I just want to make sure I understand the discussion point around having – Microsemi having stuffed not only the distribution channel but other sort of channels, including it sounds like direct customers as well. And when we marry that up with Microchip’s approach to rev-rec which is sell-through, the reduction in inventory in the channel, that doesn’t actually reduce your non-GAAP revenue, maybe perhaps a shortfall in your outlook on the revenue side is more driven by the reductions in inventory perhaps at contract manufacturing and other direct customers but not what’s going to distribution. Is that the right way to think about it?
Steve Sanghi: Well, good question, very good question. That would be the case if everything was pure. But everything was not pure. They had also – ex-management has also taken – every quarter they would take some direct customers and move them to distribution by giving distribution some discounts so they could make a margin on it. And in doing so they will take the next couple of quarters of product for that customer and stuff them into distribution. So therefore you get to recognize higher selling revenue because to the end customer you will only ship 1x. But to the distributor you can give them 1.5x or 2x and they will do some of that every quarter. So there was overall more than couple hundred million dollars of direct accounts had to move to distribution over the last year or so. And you can’t totally put your finger on it, but a lot of that seemed to coincide when it was sort of decided when the company would be sold. There is some timeline you can triangulate to but it’s not something I can really prove.
William Stein: Thanks very much.
Steve Sanghi: Therefore, there is inventory sitting in distribution for the direct customers and those direct customers we are converting them back to direct customers but they won’t be buying anything for a little while until their distribution has cleared out their inventory shipping it to the direct customers.
William Stein: Got it.
Steve Sanghi: Does that make sense to you?
William Stein: Yes, it does help clarify. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next from Raymond James we’ll hear from Chris Caso.
Chris Caso: Yes, hi. Thank you. Just a follow on to the other question. I guess as we look forward, I guess from what I’m hearing you saying is the quarterly revenue that we were seeing from Microsemi at least for the past couple of quarters was inflated if we looked at it on a pure sell-through consumption basis. Is there any way you can give us any help with where the correct run rate should be? I guess suffice it to say it’s lower than what we were seeing reported over the last few quarters.
Steve Sanghi: You’re correct. The revenue reported – I want to be very clear that there was no fraud involved because the ASC 606 allows you to recognize revenue shipped to distribution at sell-in. Now the question is --
Chris Caso: And so did the prior revenue recognition standard of 605.
Steve Sanghi: Yes, so ordinarily the management team in managing their business will ship it to distribution roughly what distribution ships out and has the distribution inventory grow only by the amount distribution is shipping higher amount in terms of business growing. That’s not really what happened here. Hiding under the revenue recognition that sell-in is a revenue recognition, there were large number of deals made with the distribution. When the inventory got higher and higher, they even offered interest subsidy to the distributor to carry inventory beyond a certain number of months because the distributor wouldn’t want to carry. There’s money tied up. And they will offer interest subsidy. So basically, shipping to distribution was made an art form almost. So yes, the revenue was higher than the real end market demand. Now at this point in time we’re not totally prepared to give you that number. I think it’s not extremely large. It’s in a few-percentage range. But we need to clear out this inventory over the next one or two quarters and ourselves be comfortable with what the run rate is. There will be – as we clean out this inventory over the next couple of quarters, there will be a larger revenue increase as we head towards the full board shipment because the inventory correction is over. So there will be some attenuation out in time of the growth rate and I think we’ll provide you some guidance over time, but not today.
Chris Caso: Okay, that’s helpful. If for my follow up, I can pivot onto the Microchip organic business and understood what you said about those four issues which were impacted revenue as we go into the September quarter. Can you talk to the sustainability of those headwinds? Is this what you would consider to be sort of a short-term issue? Maybe you could speak to the health of – outside of these four issues that you talked about the health of the remaining business and then what you’re seeing in terms of order rates? Any change in the fundamentals to the business I suppose.
Steve Sanghi: The core Microchip business does not really have any fundamental problem. I think there isn’t anything we’re trying to correct there. I think our issues are on the Microsemi side. But if you take those four points, the lead times on passives you have heard from many other companies, the whole industry is kind of being impacted. We do not know why passive lead times are that long and the growth has not been – it’s not like businesses have grown 30%, 40% where passives can’t be provided. But there must have been a significant reduction in passive capacity of some kind. So that’s not long lasting. I think as the industry corrects and passive lead times come down, that issue will go away. The tariffs and trade war is beyond our scope of being able to control it or fathom it and we don’t know any more than anybody else does what the effect of that would be. The ZTE situation, Microchip had a fairly small business with ZTE but the overall business – Microsemi had a larger business but it’s not huge. For the combined company, I can’t give you an exact number but let’s say it’s the order of 1%. Standalone, that wouldn’t be meaningful. That wouldn’t be all that large. You don’t highlight 1% kind of customers. But if there’s a demand destruction – significant demand destruction and 1 goes to 0.5, then 0.5% change on a sequential basis can be meaningful. And the bitcoin is similar. Bitcoin was on the core Microchip side. It’s not like it’s a huge business like it may be at some other companies like NVIDIA or something. For us it was like a 1% type business, but it’s down 70% or more. So standalone, it’s not really very much with all these moving parts you can make up with growth in other segments, but when you combine many of these sectors together and with all the headwinds from Microsemi, we cannot make up for these small components when you add these four together. I don’t know if that helps.
Chris Caso: Yes, it helps. Thank you.
Operator: Next we’ll go to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach: Yes. Thank you. Steve, just going back to the topic of tariffs and the business confidence, are you seeing any change in terms of order activity that your customers had been placing?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, we are seeing it and order activity – more than that I think we are seeing it in distribution sell-through in China to those customers. Still a lot of business in China is done through distribution just because – just logistics and all that. We do business both direct and distribution. We’re seeing it in both channels. The distribution does business with lots and lots of small customers who build stuff, hardware that ships back into U.S. And we have always told you our business consist of long-tail thousands and thousands of – probably 70,000, 80,000 small customers which can adjust their build rates in real time. They’re very nimble. And when they think – they don’t really know whether they can pass on this cost to end customer in U.S., whether they are competitive with 25% duty, will this product have a duty or not have a duty, it makes them pull back on their builds. And we’re seeing that impact in sales out from distribution in China.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. I appreciate the color there. And then on Microsemi, once you get through the inventory correction adjustments over the next couple of quarters, are there any parts of the business that you call out that you see is attractive from a growth perspective or have a better outlook once you get passed these issues?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we like lots of different businesses. They have very good FPGA business, they have very good business in the data center, they have very, very good business in analog, discrete, aerospace and defense. And then their certain businesses may be not as great. I mentioned one that the electronics business they bought. We don’t know why they bought that. We have some – that was a low margin business and Microchip would not have bought it. But yes, there are a number of good businesses. What attracted us to Microsemi in the first place really hasn’t changed. We had not imagined the seven months of inventory correction and crisis that we had to go through, but fundamentally we’re seeing fiscal year '21 guidance that we gave you on $8 per share is now conservative. This year – we said by the end of this fiscal year we’ll be producing $0.75 of accretion. We think that is conservative.
Craig Hettenbach: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And next we have Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin Cassidy: Thanks for taking my question. On the CapEx guidance, it seems the second half of the year the CapEx comes down quite a bit to maybe 2.5% of revenue or so. Is that going to be the run rate going forward or is that just a temporary adjustment?
Eric Bjornholt: I would say longer term, Kevin, probably a good estimate to use is 4% of revenue. We need to continue to evaluate the Microsemi business and see with the investments there. Obviously we’ll be looking to see if there is ways that we can improve the margin on their products by making investments like we’ve done in other acquisitions and investing in assembly and test and bringing activities in-house. So I think that’s kind of the swing factor there. But we were more heavily weighted in the frontend of fiscal '19 from a CapEx perspective.
Kevin Cassidy: And that heavily weighted those products you were targeting, certain long lead times. So as all your lead times, you feel like you’ve got the equipment in place to correct that?
Eric Bjornholt: Our lead times are in very good condition at this point in time. I think Steve mentioned that the majority of our products have lead times with four to eight weeks. And there’s always some exceptions to that and we’re making the proper investments to correct all of our lead times to the right level.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. Chris, go ahead.
Christopher Danely: Can you hear me?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, Chris, go ahead.
Christopher Danely: Sorry, wrong mute button, fat fingers. Danely here. So just a couple of clarifications. So Steve, it sounds like the headwinds from Microchip and Microsemi are going to last a couple of quarters. I guess conceptually, how big of an impact should we be thinking about into the December and March quarters would it be? And then what gives you confidence that revenue should bottom in the March quarter? And then do you think that at least the slowdown you’re seeing on I guess the classic Microchip business, would you expect this to hit others in the space?
Steve Sanghi: Well, to the last question I don’t have any comment. For others, ask the others. We don’t comment on the industry, we comment only on ourselves. In terms of the inventory correction, inventory correction we can somewhat control because we’re working with distribution and contract manufacturers and end customers moving the end customers back from distribution to direct which will erroneously transfer to distribution and should not have been. And that we know complete sometime in the calendar fourth quarter. And to distribution, we are monitoring very, very carefully shipping less product to them. With the distribution, they didn’t want all this inventory. So in the month of June, we simply didn’t offer them any discounts and they didn’t take the inventory. You don’t have to do much. You just run the business, distribution buy what you need and it will get corrected by the end of the year. You don’t have to do much in that case because inventory was jammed through incentives and discounts and to smaller distributors even threatening. You don’t do any of that, inventory would correct. So we have high confidence that the inventory corrects. That’s not an issue. The impact of tariffs nobody can call. We really don’t know what happens in the trade war area. The passive components issue I think should go away because capacity is being added. I think that should go away. ZTE is temporary. ZTE will get its act together and figure out what the real demand is, what demand they have lost of their competitors. And the bitcoin is anybody’s guess. It’s not a huge portion of our business over a long period of time. For $1.5 billion roughly per quarter, 1%, we’re talking about $15 million a quarter. So it’s really not a huge, huge portion of the business and we don’t know whether bitcoin comes back to its old glory or not. So I think the main issue is the inventory correction one. That gets corrected in six months and then tariff one is not clear.
Christopher Danely: Thanks. I guess one last quick one before I leave. Were these guys worse than Atmel in terms of the shenanigans they were pulling out there? You guys corralled the Atmel stuff pretty handedly. Is this a similar situation or is it worse?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I’m not willing to accuse anything. I just think the accounting standing is wrong. And we have been seeing it from the beginning and we have already been in position to taper on it when the accounting standard was changed for its sell-in. All you need is a willing distributor or a set of distributors who are willing to take increasing amount of inventory which will ship out eventually some day. There are products in distribution from Microsemi that will take two years to clear. It’s not a huge amount like we’re seeing the majority of it will clear by the end of the year, but there are certain products every quarter they will take certain products, older products and slate them as end of life. Then they will build three, four years of inventory and give it to a distributor and recognize it for revenue in the current quarter. And next quarter do it with some more products. And standard allows it. Since it’s nonreturnable by the distributor, you gave them at a deep discount and you gave them interest subsidy so the distributor is willing to carry it. They will eventually ship it. The standard allows you to recognize it for revenue. So they didn’t do anything illegal. But the issue is they represented to us, to their own analysts before, to their customers or to the investors and everybody else that there was an end run rate. And legally there was a run rate because it will continue to do this for I don’t know how long, until some day it burst. That’s not how we do it. We have never stuffed the channel in our life. We have always recognized revenue on sell-through even though now GAAP standard says you have to account for sell-in, we are giving you that GAAP number but we’d give no GAAP guidance. We manage our business on sell-through. All our incentives are based on sell-through. So I’d just say – that’s really what happened. They did what they were allowed to do.
Christopher Danely: Okay. Thanks a lot for all the clarifications, Steve.
Operator: Our next question will come from Krysten Sciacca with Nomura/Instinet.
Krysten Sciacca: Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe just a different take on the revenues for the second half of this fiscal year. So on prior calls you’ve noted that December and March typically tend to be the softer quarters seasonally with December being the weakest. Given the inventory issues that you are having with Microsemi, are you expecting any changes to the seasonality or do you expect this to still be the case?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we expect that still to be the case. But what you start to see is really certain products inventory corrects. It doesn’t all correct in one day. Certain products have high inventory, certain products have low inventory and every month certain products inventory corrects. So their run rate returns back to normal. So you got lots of moving parts where you should see an ordinary kind of December weak quarter to the extent certain products inventory has corrected, those see an uplift. So I think driven by all those, we should just see a normal low-single digit down kind of December quarter. I think that’s usually what we see.
Eric Bjornholt: I think in all our acquisitions in the past as well, seasonality – the blended seasonality will adjust and it will take some time before all that settles out. So I don’t think a historical seasonality would be an accurate predictor of future seasonality when there are acquisitions with different seasonality and different blending taking place.
Krysten Sciacca: Understood. Thanks for the detail. And then on a more positive note, can you just maybe detail what was behind some of the strong growth in analog and in your microcontroller segment for classic Microchip this quarter?
Ganesh Moorthy: If you’re asking for segments of growth, we don’t breakout any of the segments. Those businesses have been in a long-term growth mode. We have shared with you what we have been doing with Microchip 2.0 with the total system solutions. You have to note though that some of the growth this quarter that we’re showing sequentially is a combined company growth and so reflects some of the addition of Microsemi in those numbers. We haven’t broken out the classic Microchip microcontrollers or analog other than to give you some comfort that they both hit records, they both grew more than classic Microchip as an average so that you can see the underlying strength in those businesses.
Steve Sanghi: I would say some of the questions are overly focused on just the shortfall in revenue guidance. Nobody has mentioned that the earnings guidance is $0.07 better than consensus. I think the old consensus was $1.67 to $1.68 and the midpoint we’re guiding $1.74. So we’re doing very well actually. We’re increasing our assessment of the overall earnings for the year and going out of the year, the accretion we can get. So I think look at the glass also half full. And we at the end of the day deliver non-GAAP earnings per share increasing amount. That is our goal. That’s where all our incentives are built on. That’s what the Board manages us by. And even the EBITDA doesn’t give you the credit for a lower tax rate. If the earnings per share are better for a given share count, that’s creating higher amount of total profit after tax. So we feel pretty good about where we are and how we executed the quarter, how we are carrying out the integration. The issues and challenges we’ve seen in inventory correction, just straightforward. They are flexible. It’s not like we need to device a tool or do some invention. There are just the normal blocking and tackling to correct this. But otherwise, earnings per share are great.
Krysten Sciacca: Great. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I understand product line rationalization is kind of taking a second priority to some of the more structural changes you’re making in terms of business process improvements at Microsemi. But if I look at Microsemi’s data center storage and OTN optical product lines, these are very different products; leading edge silicon, leading edge packaging, big, complex chip designs. Very different versus Microchip’s focus on classic, embedded microcontroller, analog, memory and all the other complementary building blocks around this. So help me understand how the storage and the OTN optical stuff kind of fits into the Microchip 2.0 model?
Ganesh Moorthy: So they are standalone businesses. You’re right. They do have more leading edge process technologies and design technologies and packaging in many cases that they use. But that’s not different from when we went to SMSC five years ago, six years ago, in the acquisition. It brought a new degree of complexity. We adapt to it. It fits within the overall portfolio. We find the strengths that the acquired entity has and bring it into the rest of Microchip. We find the strength that Microchip has and take it back to the acquired businesses. And on a blended basis, if we don’t get out of our box, our growth opportunity is unlimited. So, of course, new product lines will bring new complexity but they also bring lots of opportunity to use the strengths of both companies and that’s the way we look at it and how we go forward. And in these two businesses, in specific, there’s also a substantial amount of Microchip classic content available to us to take into those markets where they have significant strength, customer presence and visibility into what else is needed. And in fact, some of the reference designs I talked about, where the joint sales teams have looked at, that’s coming from the joint teams looking and saying, wow, here’s things Microchip didn’t know could be done added to things that Microsemi does extremely well in certain applications and certain customers.
Steve Sanghi: I tell you guys after every acquisition that don’t underestimate, don’t undersell Microchip management’s ability to transform the company to take on the challenges that the new acquisition presents. In Standard Microsystems, the complaint was they’re vertical, you’re horizontal. Look at how well that thing has worked out. In the case of Atmel, they’re ARM and you’re MPS and all that. Look at how well that thing has worked out. So don’t underestimate Microchip’s ability and the management team and huge pipeline we have built internally that we prepare for this to take on the new challenges and expand our business. We’re about the eighth largest U.S. semiconductor market cab in a consolidating industry. You can’t just be sitting in your box and want everything to come with a nice bowtie, only microcontroller. We have to get into other businesses and grow our business in a consolidating industry.
Ganesh Moorthy: And it reinforces Steve’s point earlier that as we move forward, we focus on the combined company opportunities, rather than trying to box it and saying, well, let’s make the old one look good or the new one look good. It’s really the combined company opportunities that provide the richest forward-looking opportunities.
Steve Sanghi: A number of our business units are planning to leapfrog the lithography at the foundries by skip one generation and leapfrog because that leapfrog technology has already been used by Microsemi in some of the same business units that you’re mentioning with library available, with experience available, with EST structures and chip designs and all that kind of stuff available. It will accelerate our roadmap and leapfrog the technology to be able to reuse some of that stuff at Microchip. So I think that’s kind of how we look at it. The ship is very safe in the harbor but that’s not why ships are made for. We can’t sit in our box and just look for everything to be a neat little microcontroller. We have to branch out and be able to expand our business and we have done successfully that in the last decade.
Harlan Sur: Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the great insights.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Operator: Next from Darphil, we have Gil Alexandre. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Sanghi: Hello, Gil.
Gilbert Alexandre: Thanks for taking my question. I’ll get back to tariffs. Is there a willingness to compromise and how is it affecting your automotive business?
Steve Sanghi: Well, is there a willingness to compromise? Compromise by who? That compromise has to be between the Chinese and U.S. authorities and that’s way above my pay grade. That’s not – in terms of the automotive business, I think our automotive business – I don’t think our automotive business has yet been affected by tariffs.
Ganesh Moorthy: No. I think some of the uncertainties are there. Cars are built in the U.S. and shipped to other parts of the world. Cars are built in Europe and shipped into the U.S. And some of the discussions have created uncertainty. We’ll see how it all plays out. But I think Steve’s right. It’s not a current impact.
Steve Sanghi: So far automobiles are not included in the tariffs. Steel and all that are, but the built automobiles are not included. It’s still in negotiation. So when they had an edict on July 6 and then August 23, a set of products that have tariffs, washers and dryers and those things are included. Cars are not. Cars are not dutiable right now. Some of the car components are like steel. So this thing is still raw. Thank you for your question, Gil.
Gilbert Alexandre: I thank you and good luck.
Steve Sanghi: Yes. Thank you. Anybody else, operator?
Operator: Yes. Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International Group.
Christopher Rolland: Hi, guys. I think it’s nice to see you guys get out in front of this in the true Microchip way. I think it’s appreciated by guys who have known your track record. So, Steve, as we try to judge this snapback in revenue, once you work through this inventory, can you give us some perspective of perhaps how long this over-shipment issue was going on for? Was it just the last few quarters when they knew that they were in negotiations or was this accumulated over a couple of years?
Steve Sanghi: Well, there are a lot of moving parts and you can’t put a complete finger on it because there is some EOL mechanism with which they put the distribution inventory. Normal amount of inventory was very high. There was a huge nonlinearity. A lot of stuff was shipped undetermined. There was also this direct to distribution conversion. So there were a lot of these programs inter-layered. And I’m not accusing anything but I’m just saying that the timing, roughly it all started about a year or so ago which is more like when the conversations about the acquisition began. But I couldn’t prove that. I think it’s very, very rough.
Christopher Rolland: Yes, sounds pretty common in a lot of these deals. And then lastly, on Microsemi’s product pricing. After the Atmel deal, you saw a lot of kind of pricing imbalances. I can’t remember. Maybe they were selling some below gross profit, if I remember right, or priced it below gross profit. Are you seeing anything like that here and just any other tidbits on where you get more synergies?
Steve Sanghi: I think on that, think I will give kudos to the sales and marketing team. The prices are not below market or anything like that. But when they got an excellent price for a customer, then they inserted a distributor and kept the customer price the same and then they discounted to the distributor, gave an interest subsidy to carry the inventory. After a good price negotiated with the customer, they asked the customer to take much more inventory than the customer wanted and offered them a discount. So I think the pricing by marketing was done well. But then later on in the overzealous attempt to really recognize higher revenue, they kind of did their own thing on the top of that. So this one is easier to correct. It’s much harder to raise prices on the customer. It’s much easier simply not to offer the discount and say, just buy what you need, customer. I don’t want you to buy a lot of product that you don’t need. So we think this one is easier for us to correct that way.
Ganesh Moorthy: And the high starting gross margins are a good indicator of how that was far better disciplined than other acquisitions we’ve done. And hopefully there’s some upside from the discounting being rolled off that we’ll see in the coming quarters.
Christopher Rolland: Yes, good point. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Next we’ll hear from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.
Craig Ellis: Thanks for taking the question. And Steve and team, thanks for all the color on where you see things shaking out at this point of the integration. Steve, I wanted to follow up on a comment that you made in the Q&A regarding the deal’s accretion in the current quarter. I think you said your synergies are tracking above the prior expectation for $0.15 of accretion. And if I heard that correctly, the question is does that mean that while retaining longer-term accretion targets, $0.75 run rate first full year, $8 a couple years out, that you’re realizing your synergies earlier but you still have the same expectation, or do you think you’re tracking above prior expectations? And to the extent that’s the case, can you identify where you think that is?
Steve Sanghi: So a little bit of both. So I said that we believe that the accretion run rate at the end of the first year will be higher than $0.75. We didn’t numerically say what the number is because there is still – like I said, the numbers are going to be noisy here for the next couple of quarters because there’s just a lot of moving parts. But as we get out by June next year, we see a number higher than $0.75, which will represent really a little bit of pull-in based on our prior plan. Now in terms of $8 for fiscal year '21, we see that as conservative also. Internally, we’re modeling a number higher than $8. So that is the incremental accretion. I think some of that difference is coming from tax rate, lower tax rate also.
Craig Ellis: That’s helpful. And then previously the company and on this call, the company had identified the 300 million in synergies targets. When do you think you’ll be able to provide some color on how that breaks out between revenue synergies, COGS synergies and other synergies?
Steve Sanghi: Really never. We’re just going to deliver it, never going to break it out.
Craig Ellis: Okay. Given that quick response, can I take a swing at another one? There’s been a lot of discussion on what you found with distribution and I’ve heard you talk a lot about levels and what happened with shipments. But the question is really an operational one. What have you found with respect to the appropriateness of the consignment versus demand generation distribution, geographic representation, and the degree to which you think you’ve got a good distribution fit for the business that exists there? And how long does it take to right-size any of the operational changes that are needed with distribution?
Steve Sanghi: So as we have interfaced with a lot of the distributors, some of them by the way, a fair number of them are common with Microchip. Their largest distributor was Arrow Electronics and our largest distributor is Arrow Electronics. And similarly there are some other common distributors in Asia and Japan and Europe and others. A large amount of interaction with the distributors was how much inventory they would take. It basically began around the middle of the quarter and large amount of I would say tension with the distributor was largely how much inventory would you take. And so as we have spoken with the distributors, distributors feel refreshed and saying that you’re not going to force me to take inventory I never wanted. You will in fact let me drain down my inventory. And so we can have a conversation about demand creation, reference design, how can we together build the business, let’s go call on common customers, let’s highlight and beef up the Web site and put reference designs and solutions on it. How do we take advantage of Total Systems Solution, Microchip and Microsemi common products going into the same platform, on and on and on? So conversations with distributors have turned into positive interactions regarding growing the business. And before that – and this distributors are telling us. The ex-management of Microsemi is gone. Distributors are telling us that this tension about such a large amount of inventory jamming took all the oxygen out of the room. It just consumed the entire energy and interaction with the distributors.
Ganesh Moorthy: And it’s actually liberated time within the company as well because the business units and others that were all part of that discussion process.
Craig Ellis: When do you start to see a positive benefit from this new conversation that’s occurring?
Steve Sanghi: You will start to see it as – if inventory bleeds out by the end of this calendar year, you’ll start to see the impact starting in the March quarter. So if you’re talking about getting brand new designs in production, that usually takes 12 to 18 months. But you’ll start to see impact on the funnel, impact on joint opportunities, probably as early as late this quarter.
Craig Ellis: Thanks for the insight, Steve.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.
Rajvindra Gill: Thank you. Hi. How are you? Just switching to earnings, as you noted, Eric, what is the deleveraging campaign? Is that changing at all given the situation? And as part of the $8 per share in fiscal year '21, how much of that is related to a lower interest reduction related to deleveraging? Just wondered if you could talk about that in the grand scheme of earnings being the end to be all of everything?
Eric Bjornholt: So the deleveraging approach is essentially all cash generation above and beyond the dividend is going to go to pay down debt. We aren’t going to do anything unnatural. We’re not going to push inventory into the distribution channel to generate cash and things like that.
Steve Sanghi: We’re not going to cut the dividend.
Eric Bjornholt: We’re going to run the business, going to get our synergies as quickly as we can and with that generate cash to pay it down. And so we are definitely a little bit behind schedule to start and we’ve got a little bit of a headwind in front of us. But long-term cash generation and operating profit generation from these businesses combined is very high. No real change in that long-term outlook. So hopefully that answers your question. And then obviously, as we pay down debt, there’s interest expense reduction. That’s built into our forecast but we aren’t going to give any real details in terms of how that lays out quarter-by-quarter at this time.
Steve Sanghi: One of his questions was really what portion of our incremental to possibly $8 is tax-related? Rajeev, what I would say is that in the past when R&D tax credit used to go away every year and then used to come back later in the year, most companies will have a much lower tax rate in the fourth quarter and then they’ll true up and have a much lower tax rate and sometimes make up the earnings miss with that tax rate and all that. And analysts and investors will discount the additional earnings per share coming by the tax rate. This is not that kind. This is real tax rate current quarter. There is nothing we’re taking from the past to our future. This is actual good old tax planning which for the next several years we’ll have a very low tax rate. So you should look at that as it’s no better or worse than earnings per share produced from higher gross margin or higher revenue or lower expenses or anything else.
Rajvindra Gill: No, that’s true. At the end of the day, that’s what it is. And last question, Steve, I know it might be difficult to understand the tariffs, but in late 2014, you saw a slowdown in China industrial, you saw a slowdown in China housing. You were one of the first ones to note that. And then we did see a slowdown in China in 2015. I’m just wondering is that a scenario that could repeat itself, or just any general thoughts on that? Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: Rajeev, I resigned from that job back in 2014. I would let those jobs be yours rather than mine. I’ll just talk about our business. I get no benefit from that. I’ll let you guys decode that.
Rajvindra Gill: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis: Thanks for taking my question. Just one for Eric. Eric, in the trailing previous four quarters, free cash flow tracked pretty close to the non-GAAP net income. This quarter, there’s a little bit more of a gap and I think that’s typical when you start integration process. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of when does the free cash flow start to track back to the net income, if you could give us any help on that, I’d appreciate it? Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: I think we had a big correction in June as we’ve kind of talked about. I think it continues through the end of the calendar year to have a little bit of pressure on that because of the continued reduction that we expect in distribution inventory. But after that, I think it should return to a more normalized basis.
Mark Lipacis: Fair enough. Thank you.
Eric Bjornholt: Welcome.
Operator: And as that was our final question, gentlemen, I’ll turn the call back over to you for final comments.
Steve Sanghi: Well, we want to thank everyone for attending this call. We’ll see some of you on the road at conferences, which I think begin again late August and September. So thank you very much.
Operator: And that concludes today’s conference call. We thank you for joining.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 financial results conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's President (sic) [Chairman] and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you. I'd like to turn the call to Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer, first. Eric, go ahead.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Okay. Good morning, everybody. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2018 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and make some specific comments on the pending acquisition of Microsemi. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were just over $1 billion, above the high end of our guidance and up 0.8% sequentially from net sales of $994.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at the high end of our guidance at 61.7%, which is a new record level for Microchip. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 22.2% of sales, and non-GAAP operating income was a record 39.5%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $351.3 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.40, which was above the high end of our guidance of $1.37. Non-GAAP EPS in the March 2018 quarter was up 20.7% compared to the March quarter of 2017. For fiscal year 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $3.981 billion and up 13.7% year over year. Gross margins were 61.1%. Operating expenses were 22.4% of sales, and operating income was 38.7% of sales. Net income was $1.356 billion, and non-GAAP EPS was $5.45 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, gross margins in the March 2018 quarter, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 61.4%. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.3 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $371 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $122.8 million, share-based compensation of $20 million, $5.2 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and special charges of $0.2 million. GAAP net income in the quarter was $146.7 million or $0.58 per diluted share, and was impacted by a couple of discrete events in the quarter. GAAP net income was impacted by a $15.5 million charge associated with marking our investments to market through the P&L. These investments used to be held to maturity, but since the investments will be liquidated to fund the acquisition of Microsemi, the unrealized loss that would have been recorded in other comprehensive income in the absence of the anticipated acquisition was recognized in earnings. GAAP net income was also impacted by $38.9 million of discrete tax expense during the quarter, primarily associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For fiscal year 2018, net sales were a record $3.98 billion. Gross margins were 60.8%. Operating expenses were 37.3% of sales, and operating income was 23.5% of sales. Net income of $255.4 million was $1.03 per diluted share. The non-GAAP tax rate was 8.4% in the March quarter. As we have continued to evaluate the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we are now expecting about $327 million of taxes to be paid over the eight years related to the tax incurred on foreign earnings that were permanently invested offshore, referred to as the transition tax. This estimate is up modestly from what we had discussed with investors last quarter. We estimate the tax payments to be approximately $26 million in years one through five, $49 million in year six, $65 million in year seven, and $82 million in year eight. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and these estimates may change as we complete our full analysis. As we look forward, excluding the transition tax from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we expect our ongoing long-term cash tax rate to be between 8% and 9%, which is what we are providing to investors for cash flow and non-GAAP operating model forecasting purposes. Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at March 31, 2018 was $476.2 million. Microchip had 112 days of inventory at March 31, 2018, down three days from the end of the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors was at 36 days and up two days from the December quarter. The cash flow from operating activities was $359.6 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.197 billion, of which over $700 million is domestic cash. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the majority of our offshore cash can be brought back to the U.S. without incurring any material additional tax cost. Our EBITDA in the March 2018 quarter was a record $429.6 million. Our net leverage excluding our 2037 convertible debentures was 0.95 times at March 31, 2018, positioning us well for the Microsemi acquisition. Capital expenditures were $58.4 million in the March 2018 quarter and $206.8 million for fiscal year 2018. In April, we completed a purchase of a building in San Jose for $40.8 million, which we had previously leased. This purchase will reduce our ongoing operating expenses. Excluding this building purchase, we expect about $30 million to $50 million in capital spending in the June quarter. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 to be between $200 million and $250 million, of which $70 million represents the San Jose building purchase and three other buildings being constructed, which we have discussed with you before. We are aggressively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the Atmel manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $32.8 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We performed better than we expected in the seasonally slower March quarter, with a sequential revenue growth of 0.8%. March quarter 2018 revenue over March quarter 2017 revenue grew 11%, all organic growth, as there was no contribution from acquisitions in the last four quarters. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 revenue grew a strong 13.7% over fiscal year 2017. The Microchip 2.0 transformation continues to make good progress, especially in terms of new design opportunities, as we enable our clients' innovation with the very best smart, connected and secure solutions. Taking a closer look at microcontrollers, our Microcontroller business has performed well for a March quarter, with revenue down sequentially only 0.6% as compared to the December quarter. March quarter 2018 revenue was up a very strong 13.2% over March quarter 2017. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 Microcontroller revenue at $2.6 billion was an all-time record and grew a strong 17.5% over fiscal year 2017. Microcontrollers represented 65.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. Last month, Gartner Dataquest released their microcontroller market share report for calendar 2017. We are pleased to report that Microchip retained the number one position for 8-bit microcontrollers. We were the fastest-growing 8-bit microcontroller franchise and gained substantial market share in calendar 2017, as we grew much faster than the 8-bit microcontroller market, so much so we are now approximately 60% larger than the number two 8-bit microcontroller player. In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we remained in the number five position but continued to gain significant market share, as we grew much faster than the 16-bit microcontroller market, and we're the fastest-growing franchise. In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we remained in the number six position but also gained significant market share, as we grew much faster than the 32-bit microcontroller market, and we're the fastest-growing franchise here too. For microcontrollers overall, we remained in the number three position. We're the fastest-growing franchise and grew at almost 2.5 times the microcontroller market, as we continued our relentless march towards the number one spot. Our microcontroller portfolio and roadmap has never been stronger, and we are seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel, which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share in 2018, as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Now moving to our analog business, our analog revenue was sequentially up 4.7% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter, setting a new record in the process. March quarter 2018 analog revenue grew 5.1% over March quarter 2017. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 analog revenue at $952 million was an all-time record and grew 6% over fiscal year 2017. Analog represented 24.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. As we have highlighted in investor communications over the last few quarters, our publicly reported analog results will see some revenue classification headwinds resulting from a deliberate shift in strategy we made several quarters ago. The change in product line strategy is that we have for some time been adding microcontroller cores to several of our more complex analog products, especially those that provide our clients with smart connectivity solutions. The addition of microcontroller cores to these analog products enables us to sell a higher-value and more defensible total system solution. These smart connectivity products are growing nicely. And as they replace older products in new designs, our revenue classification for these products has shifted from analog product lines to our microcontroller product line. Transitioning to more sticky and higher-margin smart connectivity revenue is the right Microchip answer, but does impact some of the product line reporting that analysts are interested in, as some of the revenue growth shifts into our microcontroller product line. In the longer term, as the revenue from the analog attach design wins continue to ramp, we fully expect that the analog product line revenue will outgrow this revenue classification headwind. Moving next to our licensing business, this business was seasonally down 4% sequentially in the March quarter, although March quarter 2018 revenue grew 14.6% over March quarter 2017. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 licensing business at $104.8 million was an all-time record and grew 14.9% over fiscal year 2017. We are seeing the fruits of having licensed many foundries and independent device makers for several years on multiple process technology nodes, manifested in our results as the licensed processes ramp volume and generate royalty revenue for many years to come. Finally, our memory business was sequentially up 3.8% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter, and March quarter 2018 grew 9.9% over March quarter 2017. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 memory revenue at $199.7 million grew 7.2% over fiscal year 2017. Now a quick update about Microsemi and our progress since our March 1 announcement, integration planning meetings and discussions are occurring between the business units, sales, manufacturing, and support groups of both companies. Teams at both companies started to identify product cross-selling opportunities that we can pursue after the close and have also identified reference designs that can take advantage of a combined total system approach. We're also determining how our product line reporting will be done post the close, and we'll have an update for you no later than the next earnings call. Steve will cover the status of regulatory and other approvals in his section. So now let me pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you, Ganesh, and good morning for you, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 and fiscal year 2018. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2019. Our March quarter financial results were excellent. Our net sales were up 0.8% sequentially and up 11% from the year-ago quarter and were above the high end of our revised guidance. The sales in our Atmel-originated business was down, consistent with Atmel seasonality. Our core Microchip business was very strong and up significantly sequentially. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 61.7% of sales was a record and at the high end of our guidance. Operating profit of 39.5% of sales was better than the high end of our guidance and made a new all-time record. And earnings per share of $1.40 was $0.055 better than the midpoint of our revised guidance. Reflecting on the fiscal year 2018 results, it was clearly the best year in the history of Microchip, in which we made many new records. Fiscal year 2018 net sales were up 13.7% from fiscal year 2017, and it was all organic growth. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip worldwide for delivering an outstanding quarter and fiscal year 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, this was also our 110th consecutive profitable quarter. Now, I will provide you with an update on Microchip 2.0. We are continuing to experience an enormous customer preference to design with our microcontroller solutions in all 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit customer applications. Our various acquisitions have now built a powerful diversified product line, through which we are able to provide total system solutions to our customers. We are winning incremental design wins with multiple products in the same boards of our customers. At our Analyst and Investor Day on March 1, 2018, we showed that the number of Microchip parts per customer system was growing at a 20% annual rate. With another quarter under our belt, the number of parts per system is continuing this trend of being up 20% over the same quarter a year ago. We have a robust design win funnel, and we feel very optimistic that Microchip 2.0 is working. We also recently received SIA [Semiconductor Industry Association] numbers for quarter ending March 31, 2018. Based on SIA numbers, our microcontroller market share grew in each of 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit product lines in the March 2018 quarter versus the year-ago quarter. Our inventories at Microchip at the end of March 2018 were 112 days, which is just slightly below our target of 115 to 120 days. We continue to make enormous progress on the manufacturing side and bringing capacity online and decreasing lead times. In the last conference call, we stated our lead times to be between 4 to 14 weeks. Our lead times now are between 4 to 10 weeks. Normal lead times would be between 4 to 8 weeks. Our book-to-bill ratio for the March quarter was extremely healthy and around the number we had given you at the Analyst Day, and our backlog has grown even higher to another record. With healthy book-to-bill ratio continuing, now will be the time to start providing quarterly numbers for book-to-bill ratio, as we had said in the Analyst Day. We have always said that book-to-bill ratio is confusing and simply tracks the lead times. We have proven it again with book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 in the December quarter. The business remained healthy in March quarter. Providing book-to-bill ratio simply increases volatility in the stock. In the March quarter, we successfully soft-landed the business, consistent with the guidance we have been providing, and we will continue to grow in the June quarter. During the quarter ending June 30, 2018, we will adopt a new GAAP revenue recognition standard, which will result in recognition of revenue at the time products are sold to distributors, whereas currently revenue on such transactions are deferred until the product is sold by our distributors to an end customer. We are not able to provide guidance on a GAAP basis, as we are not able to predict whether inventory at our distributors will increase or decrease in relation to end-market demand, and this is not how we manage our business. As evidence of this uncertainty, in recent years we have seen net inventory at our distributors increase or decrease by a significant amount in a single quarter. Our non-GAAP revenue will be based on true end-market demand, so we will report a non-GAAP revenue which will be based on true end-market demand in which we measure the revenue based on when the product is sold by our distributors to an end customer, meaning we will continue to report a non-GAAP revenue based on sell-through. We will continue to manage our business and distributor relationships based on such sell-through revenue recognition. All of Microchip's bonus programs will continue to work based on sell-through revenue recognition. Therefore, along with GAAP results, which will be based on sell-in, we will also report our non-GAAP results based on sell-through revenue recognition. In terms of guidance, we will only provide guidance based on non-GAAP revenue, so we expect total non-GAAP net revenue for the June quarter to be up 1% to 6% sequentially, giving us a midpoint of the guidance at 3.5%. Given the amount of revenue beat in March quarter, this guidance is modestly better than the expectation we had provided during the Analyst Day. Regarding gross margin, we see a steady improvement in overall gross margin of the company based on Microchip 2.0 margin drivers. We expect gross margin for the June quarter to be between 61.6% and 62% of sales. We expect our overall operating expenses to be between 22% and 22.4% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 39.2% and 40% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $1.39 and $1.49 per share. All these numbers do not include Microsemi. Now I wanted to make a couple of comments on the pending acquisition of Microsemi. On April 12, 2018, we received U.S. antitrust clearance. On April 19, 2018, China's MOFCOM accepted Microchip's filing for review under Simplified Procedure. We cannot confirm yesterday's report in the press that China's MOFCOM has cleared the transaction. We believe that the review process is running smoothly, and we remain optimistic that we will receive clearance shortly. In addition, yesterday, on May 7, we did receive Japan's antitrust clearance. We expect several other countries to clear the antitrust review this month. The Microsemi shareholder vote is scheduled for May 22, 2018, and we believe that we are on schedule for closing the acquisition sometime during early June 2018. I want to remind investors that during our Analyst and Investor Day presentations, we increased our long-term financial model with the Microsemi acquisition to a non-GAAP gross margin of 63%, operating expense of 22.5%, and an operating profit of 40.5%. As you all know, we will be borrowing about $8 billion to close the Microsemi transaction. I want to assure you that after the closure of Microsemi acquisition, we plan to use all of our cash generation, after dividend and capital, of course, to rapidly delever the balance sheet until the leverage comes down to about 2.5x, which is our long-term target. In addition, given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimate to First Call. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: Thank you. We will take our first question from William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great, thanks so much for taking my question. You highlighted earlier in your prepared remarks that you've added capacity, I think, as it related to the Atmel products to reduce the lead times there. I'm wondering if you can talk about your anticipation for lead times as we go forward. Do you expect that to get in the normal range in the current quarter? And I'd also like to know as it relates to your raw materials and lead time from foundries, whether you see that as already within the normal range or if it's extended. And if there's anything remarkable about that, I'd love to hear details. Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So thank you, Will. The normal lead times are 4 to 8 weeks usually on 85% – 90% of the products. That's what we call a normal lead time. There will always be some strange products or specialized projects that need extra work or extreme circumstances where the lead time would be longer. So for a majority of the products, 4 to 8 weeks lead time is normal. We are currently at 4 to 10 weeks, so we've got a little more progress to make. And as we have been saying for about a year or longer is that we expect the lead times to essentially become normal by the end of June, and we are really on schedule for that. The other part of your question was lead times at suppliers and foundries and all that. Scattered issues here and there, but in general, the foundry lead times are normal. We're able to get the capacity we need from our foundries. We're able to get the assembly/test equipment that we're acquiring. Again, the lead time could be 2 to 4 weeks longer to get some of the test equipment, but it also largely depends on what you're buying and what the mix of equipment is, what you're trying to buy, and what particular setup you need. But lead times are really not excessive either on foundry wafers or on assembly and test equipment.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Helpful, thanks so much and congrats on the good results and outlook.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. Steve, any update on industry pricing, be it from some of the consolidation, some of the favorable impact there, also relative to just the tight conditions today and how that might be influencing pricing?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Type of what?
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: The pricing environment today, just if you can, talk about just how the consolidation in the industry is influencing that as well as just the tight industry conditions.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Okay, tight industry conditions. So the pricing is very normal. We've been saying for quite a while that the historic industry practice where the prices went down every year, we are really no longer following that trend. We have seen some others follow it. We are winning a lot more often at customers not giving them year-to-year price reduction. Five years ago, we'll succeed some of the times; today we succeed most of the time. So industry pricing for us really looks very normal. We did some price increases in the last two years. I think that's largely behind us. Now prices are stable but they're not going down. Meanwhile, we are continuing to improve cost on a lot of products by bringing assembly/test inside with the die shrinks and others. And in those cases, some of those are improving the gross margin as you're seeing it. Now in terms of tight industry conditions, they're obviously helping pricing. The consolidation is also helping prices, but where the industry conditions are tightest are really not on microcontroller, analog, and Wi-Fi and other products we make. Industry conditions are the tightest on passives. There could be 40 – 50 weeks lead time to really get capacitors and products like that, and I think that's where we are seeing price increases. We don't sell those devices. We don't compete with them, but we buy some of those devices for our development tool and all that. It's not a very high-cost component for us because development tool is a very small business, but we are seeing long lead times and tight supply especially on passives.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it, thanks for sharing that. And then just a follow-up for Ganesh on the Microchip 2.0 cross-selling, and any additional milestones you can share with us on the progress you're making?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: All our internal indicators look good. As Steve mentioned, attach is one of those things we are continuing to measure how that is growing quarter over quarter and year over year. It's a long-term process, but we're sowing lots of seeds and taking care of those seeds to make sure that they bloom, and we're very confident that it will continue to grow and provide growth for us as an incremental growth driver.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I realize Microchip's own inventory came down and is a little bit below your target range. I was hoping you could extend that discussion a bit further and talk about where you think inventory is in the channel and any changes you expect distributors to be making with their inventory.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: The inventory was a little lower than our expectation because sales were higher than our expectation. Our guidance at the midpoint was minus 1% sequentially. And based on that, inventory would be slightly higher and in the range of 115 days to 120 days. Instead, we reported sales which were up 0.8%, so 1.8% beat. Its net result was the inventory days were slightly lower. I think inventory is fine. Two, three days don't really make that kind of difference. We're comfortable with the inventory position. Inventory, there are always products which are showed and the product was a little high. So there's a continuous effort constantly to get the inventory in the perfect mix. And there's no such thing as perfect, but our inventory is in good shape.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And there was a lot of discussion in the last earnings call and at the Analyst Day about what new seasonality for the company is. I was hoping you could help us better contextualize how you think about guidance for this coming quarter of up 1% to 6% sequentially. How does that compare to what that new seasonality may be? And are there any headwinds or tailwinds relative to normal seasonality that you're trying to factor into your guidance for this coming quarter?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So I think at the Analyst Day, we said June quarter was 5%, if you recall, sequentially, but we beat the March quarter by 1.8%. So when you put it all together, at the 3.5%, we're slightly better than that guidance. We did better in manufacturing last quarter in shipping some delinquency that originally we thought we were going to ship it in the June quarter, but we were able to do better and were able to ship some more in the March quarter, which resulted beating the March quarter, and then a little bit of the product went from June into March. We're facing a lot of one-time issues. There is a slight impact because of ZTE. We can't ship to ZTE. There are long lead times on passive that we talked about, so certain customers are telling us that they don't need our product because they cannot get passives to complete their boards and systems. China. That has been lowered from 17% to 16%. It doesn't sound much, sounds trivial, but a number of customers asked us to delay shipment from April into May because the lower VAT was effective on May 1. So that pushed some shipments from April into May, but that's kind of a wash for the quarter. But you never know whether they didn't do some production in April and whether there will be any net result for the quarter, hopefully not. The overall trade tensions, we're not seeing any impact of that, but if anything else crazy happens, then you have to account for that. None of those items I talked about really are significant. They're all 0.1% – 0.2% issues sequentially, but you add all four or five of them and it could be in a 0.5% to 1% probably impact driven by many of these factors together. I think what we guided June quarter is really seasonal, especially if March quarter was minus 1% and the June quarter would have been totally seasonal. So we don't have years of experience with Atmel and the numbers for that seasonality, but what we're guiding seems to be close to seasonal. The other point is this is all going to change again when the Microsemi deal closes in June. And all the rest of the quarters again, we don't have experience on seasonality. And then when we come to the next March and next June, we're going to have to go through same learning process again. And we barely finished the learning process on Atmel, so that is the challenge of growth through acquisitions.
Operator: We will take our next question...
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Did that answer your question?
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks so much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on the nice execution. Steve, I wanted to start with two clarifications. One, if you could, provide any color for us on whether this round of approvals, especially through MOFCOM, is different than what you've seen in the past. And secondly, I thought I heard the statement that the company is expected to borrow about $8 billion related to the upcoming Microsemi transaction, but I thought on the initial announcement it was $8.6 billion. So has there been a modest reduction in the expected debt that's undertaken to complete that transaction?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So answering your second part of your question first, the number that we had stated was really going off the December numbers. And from December to June, we are substantially a cash generating entity, so we have generated $0.5 billion-plus of cash in that time, and so has Microsemi. So there's a portion reduction coming from there. I think that's the only change. Eric, do you want to add anything to that?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: No, that's exactly right, so that essentially just represents the cash flow between the end of December and the expected closing date.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: And the debt level that Microsemi has is a bit lower from what it was at that time. They have paid some debt down.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: That's helpful, and then any color on how this process through MOFCOM would differ from prior?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So last time we had MOFCOM approval was when we bought Microsemi (sic) [SMSC], which was in 2012. At that time, MOFCOM didn't have a lot of resources. The M&A activity wasn't as brisk, and it was largely few deals used to require MOFCOM and was a long process. It seemed relatively unorganized back then. Any of the deals we have done in between, including ISSC, Supertex, Micrel, and Atmel, none of them required MOFCOM. You require MOFCOM if both entities, buyer and the seller, exceed a threshold of revenue in Mainland China. I think the number is $83.6 million, but don't exactly hold me to it. It's in that range, and none of our other acquisitions have required MOFCOM. So since 2012, this is the first time we applied for MOFCOM, and we have found that MOFCOM is now substantially very well-organized, has a very good procedure. They take the first month to identify a given transaction to be a simple procedure or a normal procedure. Simple procedure usually is cleared within 30 days, and a normal procedure takes a little longer. So that's why when our transaction was rated by MOFCOM to be under simple procedure, that was encouraging news and we shared it with the investors. That happened on May 19 (sic) [April 19] (40:17), so 30 days really end on May 18. There's no guarantee that even under simple procedure, you get it on that day or not or it takes longer or any new questions emerge, but we're pretty optimistic that this is going very, very smooth and we should be getting approval very rapidly here.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: That's very helpful. If I could ask one question to either you or Ganesh, impressive performance with Microchip 2.0 initiatives driving a 20% increase in parts per system board. As you look ahead to Microsemi, how does Microsemi impact that growth rate on your design wins on a per system board basis? Thanks, guys.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Go ahead, Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So it's early days. What we are very encouraged by is the methodology that Microsemi uses for their equivalent of Total System Solutions. I showed some examples during the Investor Day on March 1, and they have an extremely well organized approach of how to take products from multiple business units and position them into the end markets that they're providing solutions for. And in the early discussions between the two companies, we have both identified places where each other's products can further strengthen those demo boards or reference designs or customer propositions that we can get. So it's too early to tell you what the rate will be, but I am very encouraged by how the approach is common and the employees of the two companies are looking for ways to exploit that farther after the close.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Great, thanks again.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, guys. Steve, now that we're working through the June quarter, can you just give us your best guess of combined seasonality for you guys plus Atmel for the September and December quarters, and then also maybe compare this deceleration that we've just seen versus the deceleration that occurred at the end of 2014?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So I think – I don't really have numerical numbers for all the quarters for seasonality. I believe that the December and March quarters continue to be weak quarters, and June and September continue to be strong quarters, so we're guiding good sequential growth in June. And I would expect the same thing for September, and then December is usually the weakest quarter for the combined companies. And March, also driven by the Atmel seasonality, is slightly negative although this quarter we just announced was slightly positive. So I don't think that has changed, strong June, strong September, weakest December, and a weak March. Mind you, this is all going to change with Microsemi, whose seasonality we do not understand yet. And the second part of your question was what?
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes, just compare the deceleration that we've seen with lead times coming in to what happened in 2014. We had a deceleration back then. It was obviously a little bit sharper, but it seems like the time period was roughly the same. Would you agree with that?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: 2014 deceleration was driven by a significant slowdown in China that everybody saw. I don't recall what caused that. I think there were some government regulations change, reduced some of the subsidies from the various markets. There were a lot of things, and it was so clearly driven by China. This deceleration is not driven by any place. World economies are synchronously going up, and I think the business environment is pretty good worldwide. This is just as the longer lead times are coming in, basically business is going back to normal, so I don't really think it's at all like 2014.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, thanks. That's helpful.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Investors and analysts have been trying to compare this to 2014. Ever since we put the letter out on April last year, there has been the talk, everybody trying to compare it to 2014, and it's nothing like 2014. We've been telling you that this will soft-land, and I think you've got to give it to me that we have soft-landed it completely.
Operator: Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, thank you, Steve, and congratulations, excellent results. So a perfect segue into my question, so now that the soft landing I think you said is complete, would you give us an idea of what you're thinking in terms of just your part of the business, not MSCC, but just your part of the business and how it plays out as far as growth is concerned? And I have a question that's a follow-up.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I think it's the same question I just answered, strong June, strong September. You should see good results from us for this quarter and the next quarter, and then we go into a slow December and slow March. I think the numbers we have talked about before, mid to high single-digit growth, I think that's where we are and that's what the current guidance is, and I think the business has gone to normal after a soft landing.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Fair enough, Steve. And then your MCU business is pretty strong. I think you mentioned 2.5 times the growth rate. A lot of the large players play in the same markets as you. Everybody's targeting industrial and automotive, but you guys are doing substantially better. Is share take all of it, or are there other things going on, Steve, in your opinion?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Go ahead, Ganesh. Do you want to take that?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: A substantial portion of it is taking share. I think we're also consistent in an approach that isn't picking we're only going to do 32 bits and not focus on others. We are broad-based between 8 bits, 16 bits, and 32 bits. We find the spots that each of them succeed in. Each of them is growing. They're setting new records as they're growing. And so that breadth of what we have in solutions, how we go to market in many ways differentiates us from other people who may have a little different way of how they want to go to market. And I think the results show that, and year-in and year-out the market share has been growing, the position in that ranking has been growing. So I think there's no one silver bullet that's causing it, but our approach in go-to-market across the microcontrollers is contributing to the differentiated results in microcontrollers.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks, guys.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I would add to that, Harsh, that we are rapidly being perceived as the most reliable microcontroller supplier. They have seen significant challenges in delivery and other problems from our competitors both in Japan and Europe, and you know the names of those companies. Those companies have discontinued or end-of-life'd their large number of products from some of the companies they have merged with and created significant havoc at the customers. And the other company that is in play right now waiting for the China MOFCOM, they have seen significant dislocation or the customers have seen inconsistent supply and challenges. Microchip absorbed a very large acquisition of Atmel and other companies we have bought before. And what we have done for the customer is then not end-of-life any of the microcontrollers. The customers have a very positive experience with us through all that, and so I think we are the preferred supplier, that's why.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Congratulations, guys. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you, and I echo my congratulations. Steve, I was wondering if we could shift the conversation away from inventory and distribution, et cetera, and characterize the demand environment from a qualitative perspective, what you're seeing in industrial IoT, automotive and ADAS, how that's maybe different from last year trends and going forward.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I think the demand environment is really as normal as it can be described. There are always outliers, but the demand environment is normal. I just think last year, some of the lead times went out and the environment was more heated. After many, many years of low single-digit growth in the industry, last year industry growth was very positive. This year the growth is less than last year, but growth is still quite healthy, and the business environment is more normal this year than it was last year. I don't think anybody argues the industry can grow 13% – 14% per year. That's what it grew last year, but this year seems to be more normal.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, got it, so more normalized growth rate versus last year. And then, Eric, in terms of the CapEx, is this kind of – the CapEx is going to change with Microsemi, but I'm wondering if you could give us some insight on how we should think about CapEx in fiscal year 2019 but also more on a longer-term basis.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So for fiscal 2019, we just guided today for CapEx to be between $200 million and $250 million for the year, but that includes about $70 million of building projects. And there can always be some building projects going on, but we've got four different projects around the world that are adding to that that set us up nicely for efficient growth going forward, and we reduce lease costs and things like that. So I'd call that one out of the ordinary. So if you take building projects out of the last fiscal year, fiscal 2018, as well as fiscal 2019, at $170 million to $175 million range for CapEx, I think that's normal in a growth environment. If for any reason we saw growth decline, our maintenance CapEx is significantly lower than that, and we've seen how that can come down dramatically. But we're investing for growth, we're investing to bring manufacturing activities in house, which enhance our gross margin going forward and give us more control over the overall supply chain, so we'll continue to make those investments.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, got it, and just one question on deleveraging rapidly. Can you talk about any specific tranches that you're going to start taking out, what the impact will be on the interest expense in the near term and the medium term? Thanks.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So I'll take that question. We're not ready to give specifics yet, but Steve did say in his prepared remarks that really all of our cash flow outside of what we have for investing in the business and CapEx and dividend will be used to rapidly delever. If you look at the combination of Microchip and Microsemi, these are two very high-quality, high-operating margin, high cash flow companies, and those models combined will improve from where they are on day one. And really all that cash generation over the first couple of years is absolutely going to be pay down debt and drive us to that 2.5 times leverage target that Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks. So I don't have specifics by quarter or by year, but I think you can do your modeling and come up with a pretty good estimate.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: You can see what we did with the Atmel delevering as well.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Excellent, thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: We're going to pay the highest interest first, kind of a no-brainer. And with some regards to looking at what's the fixed debt and what's the variable debt and basically a combination of paying down term loan and the line of credit, some combination of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates. Please go ahead.
Gilbert Alexandre - Darphil Associates: Good morning and congratulations. On the Microsemi acquisition, I don't recall what you thought the earnings accretion might be year one and three. And as you did your due diligence, can you comment on any positive or negative surprises? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: It's a very general question. Since we announced the transaction, we haven't seen any positive or negative surprises. During the diligence prior to announcement of the transaction, we didn't know as much about the company before, so we didn't really have a baseline against we could see that this was a positive or negative. But there always are as we went through various business units and corporate profiles, there were things we liked and the things we did not like. I think it will be probably a longer discussion to go into it, not a way to remember it (54:49) offhand. I think the next step is when we close the transaction and then spend 90 days with the company, that's when we will see probably what we found as a positive or negative surprise. So probably ask that question in another couple of earnings calls later.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: And maybe I can just add to that to refresh people's memory of what we said on March 1. Things haven't changed from that standpoint. We were assuming a June 2018 close, which is still our expectation. We had indicated that Microsemi would add $0.75 of non-GAAP EPS accretion on an annualized run rate basis in the first year after close, and in the third year after close that we would achieve $300 million in synergy from cost savings and revenue growth, and Microsemi would contribute $1.75 of non-GAAP EPS.
Gilbert Alexandre - Darphil Associates: All right. Thank you very much, congratulations.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Within your microcontroller business, what was the fastest-growing, 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit? And is it units driving the growth or dollars?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Steve, I can take that. We don't break out growth rates for revenue by segment of the microcontrollers. As you can follow from the prepared remarks, all of them have been setting new records, so there's no one of them that is providing the growth that is offsetting any of the other ones. We're very happy with all three of them. And I think outside of that, there's nothing more to say.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, I know you don't break it out by end markets, but can you say what area of the world that you're seeing the best growth from?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So our growth is reflected in how revenue for the company is broken out by the regions of the world, so we have just under 20% in the Americas, just over 20% in Europe, and the balance is all in Asia. Now, Asian revenue reflects not only local consumption and local demand creation, but also represents business that is manufactured there for U.S. or other European companies, which then go back to the originating country. So that growth is very similar to the growth rates by end market, and the microcontrollers being such a dominant portion of Microchip at 65% revenue are going to be in the same range as what Microchip is growing in any of those regions of the world.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Charles Kazarian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, this is Charlie Kazarian on behalf of John Pitzer. Thanks for letting me ask a question today. I was hoping to dive a little bit deeper into the March quarter revenue. Specifically, you narrowed rev guidance on March 1 with a midpoint that was mostly unchanged. Could you just talk a little bit more about what specific buckets of revenue saw upside over the remaining month of the quarter? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I don't think we have that data by bucket. By buckets, I don't know whether you mean geographically buckets or you mean by end markets or you mean by product line?
Charles Kazarian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Just generically end markets or product lines or whatever you could provide would be helpful. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: End markets we don't know because on a quarterly basis, we cannot break our business by the end markets across 115,000 customers where 53% of the business is through distribution. So we only provide that data once in a while after we do some painstaking amount of work, so we don't really have the data by end market. By product line, Eric, any nuggets of where the extra growth came from?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Honestly, I think from March 1 to the close, we saw strength across really all of the product lines. They all performed well. You will definitely see that in the quarter the analog business performed better than the microcontroller business, but that was the opposite the quarter before that. So Europe was very strong. That's typically what we see in the March quarter and it closed out strong, but I really don't think that we can peg it down like that, just good overall growth across the various product lines.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: And we cleared some delinquencies that helped in the month of March, helped the growth that we had been expecting versus what we actually saw.
Charles Kazarian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thanks, guys, and nice execution on the quarter. So I like the sell-through that you guys are going to report. I wish more people would do that as well. Perhaps you guys can describe how big that difference is between sell-through and sell-in that we've seen in the past. And then, Steve, I almost get the sense that you philosophically are against sell-in. Some people think it creates bad behaviors. You're not going to incentivize your sales force on sell-in. I was wondering if you could talk about philosophically how you view that. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So you're absolutely correct. We are philosophically against sell-in because in sell-in, your relationship with distributors is built on commercial making the deals with the buyers in distribution to stuff the channel essentially. Hey, buy more of my parts, buy more of my parts. In a sell-through, the incentivization of the sales force to your effort is in driving design wins to revenue, so that the parts are going out from distributor shelves to the end customer, and that's the main difference. Company after company that we've been involved in, the companies we have bought, Atmel and Micrel and others, they all had sell-in revenue recognition. And now we know their history, we have their records, we have their books, and the amount of managing the quarter that goes on at the end of the quarter by giving distribution deals, from pricing concessions to payment terms to buddy-buddy distribution, please take another $10 million from me, all that happens is really bad behavior, and it doesn't represent demand. During the last few years as FASB was looking at defining revenue recognition, we fought that. I think we wrote a paper on it a long time ago, but FASB went down their decision where the revenue recognition for GAAP has to be sell-in. So we lost that battle, and so therefore, we have to announce GAAP based on sell-in, but we're not going to throw our religion away. We're going to manage the business based on sell-through. We're going to create demand. Our motto is drive design wins to revenue. We're going to incentivize our people. All bonus programs will be based on sell-through. We're going to measure distribution based on sell-through, but we'll go through an SEC-required GAAP exercise to report as sell-in.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great, thanks for that color, and thanks for offering sell-through. Going forward for me, OpEx was a tiny bit higher as a percentage of revenue. Perhaps just if you guys could, talk about where those investments are going, thanks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I don't think the changes are meaningful in terms of any conscious investments we made anywhere. I think it's just a large juggernaut, and there are lots of moving parts, exchange rates too. In the first quarter, you have some of the social security payments come back in for some of the people who are maxed out in the later quarters, and you could have slightly lower turnover, higher turnover and not being able to replace the people. So it's just a whole bunch of moving parts. There was really nothing – no conscious decisions were made to invest more or less.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great. Thanks, guys.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you. Do you have anything to add, Eric?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I'm just going to add one thing onto that. So we've been operating below what Microchip has said has been our operating expense model. And to drive a 40% operating margin company, you have to make investments in R&D, in technical salespeople, in support functions and everything that goes into it. We have a lot of open requisitions in the company and we're going to continue to make those investments to make sure our business just isn't strong today but it's strong 3, 5, 10 years from now.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great. Thanks, Eric.
Operator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, great execution on the fiscal 2018 performance. The analog business drove about half of the incremental upside in the March quarter and it grew about 5% year over year. That's nice acceleration from the 1.5% growth in the prior quarter and a deceleration trend prior to that, and this is despite the reclassification headwinds. Is the year-over-year reacceleration a reflection of the increased attach rates you're achieving per program, as you highlighted at Analyst Day, or do you think it's just normal quarterly fluctuations?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So there's certainly some of that, which is a reflection of work we have done previously from an attach standpoint. And we've been telling you for several quarters that the headwind is only because of the way we reclassify it, but that the underlying fundamentals of the analog business and what we're doing to create growth and attach and all those other things remain intact. Quarter to quarter you're going to see fluctuations on it, but I think the longer-term trend you should expect is that analog will have nice growth associated with what we can do with selling it as a part of our total system solutions.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thanks for the insights there. And aerospace and defense is only about 2% of core Microchip business pre-Microsemi. That percentage mix increases about 5.5x with Microsemi. I've heard that AMD is more sticky than your industrial products. I hear margins in AMD are better than industrial. First of all, would you agree with that? And does Microchip have a family of high-rel radiation-hardened MCUs, or is that something you guys hope to achieve with the Microsemi team? Thanks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So clearly, the portion of our business that will be aerospace, defense, and space will grow up with Microsemi. It is very sticky business. It is high-margin business. And so in that sense, it joins the family of industrial and automotive and other product lines we have that have similar characteristics. Some of the work technically that we have to do also take advantage of what we have to do for industrial and automotive. Specific to the rad-hard product line, yes, we do have rad-hard microcontrollers. Some of that work obviously started from Atmel and what they had been doing prior to the acquisition. And Microchip had been building more products that were ready for defense business but the rad-hard portion came really from the Atmel heritage. And it will grow significantly with Microsemi's portfolio, which is quite rich in other areas as well of defense and aerospace.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thank you.
Operator: And we have no additional questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: We want to thank all the investors for joining this call and for being investors in Microchip. All the best from us, and we'll see you during the quarter maybe at some of the conferences. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip Technology Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2018 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Net sales in the December quarter were $994.2 million, modestly higher than the midpoint of our guidance and down 1.8% sequentially from net sales of $1.012 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis gross margins were at the high end of our guidance range of 61.4% in the December quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were at 22% of sales which was a record low and below the low end of our guidance range which was 22.2%. Non-GAAP operating income was a record $391.7 million at 39.4% above the high end of our guidance of 39.2%. Non-GAAP net income was $341.2 million and was up 38.4% as compared to the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.36 which was above the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were a record 61.1% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.5 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $361.8 million, and include acquisition and tangible amortization of $121 million, share-based compensation of $20.5 million, $1.2 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and special charges of $0.2 million. GAAP net income was impacted by a $439.8 million discrete tax event in the quarter primarily associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and we also incurred a loss of $2.1 million on the retirement of our 2037 2.125% convertible bonds. After these adjustments, the GAAP net loss was $251.1 million or $1.07 per diluted share. The non-GAAP tax rate was 8.5% in the December quarter, and we expect the rate to be about the same in the March quarter. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we expect about $300 million of taxes to be paid over the next eight years related to the tax incurred on foreign earnings that were permanently invested offshore referred to as the transition tax. We estimate the tax payments to be approximately $25 million in years one through five, $45 million in year six, $60 million in year seven and $75 million in year eight. We will continue to evaluate the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and these estimates may change as we complete our analysis. We are working through the impact of recent U.S. tax reform on Microchip's longer term effective tax rate. There is no impact on the fiscal year 2018 rate as you can see from our March quarter guidance provided in today's earnings release. Excluding the transition tax from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we expect our ongoing long-term cash tax rate to be below 9%, which is what we are providing to investors and analysts for cash flow and operating model forecasting purposes. We will continue to refine this over the coming months prior to providing guidance for Q1 of fiscal year 2019. Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at December 31, 2017, was $487.1 million. Microchip had 115 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, our targeted inventory levels are between 115 and 120 days. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were at 34 days and up 3 days from the prior quarter, and in the normal historical range for distribution inventory. The cash flow from operating activities was a record $365 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $1.985 billion, of which about $550 million is domestic cash. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the majority of our offshore cash could be brought back to the U.S. without incurring any material additional tax cost. We bought back the remaining amount of our 2037, 2.125% convertible bonds in the December quarter through $58.3 million in cash. Capital expenditures were $66.4 million in the December 2017 quarter. We expect about $50 million to $60 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 to be about $200 million to $210 million, which is at the lower end of the guidance that we provided last quarter. We are aggressively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies, and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margin improvements to our business, particularly for the Atmel manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. As mentioned last quarter, our capital spending in fiscal 2018 also reflects three new building projects we are constructing in Arizona, India and Germany, which will give us meaningful lease cost reductions and avoidance in the future, as well as allow us to cost effectively scale our future growth. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $32 million. We also want to provide an update on the tax treatment of our dividends. In fiscal year 2017, our dividends paid to shareholders were treated as return of capital and we were expecting similar treatment in fiscal year 2018. The tax cuts and Jobs Act which passed in December 2017 has changed this outlook. Due to the U.S. taxation and fiscal year 2018 of our foreign earnings which were historically permanently invested offshore, Microchip is taxable in the U.S. in fiscal year 2018. As a result, dividends in the June September and December 2017 quarters are fully taxable to our shareholders, and dividends to be paid in March 2018 will be fully taxable to our shareholders. We believe the impact of U.S. tax reform on Microchip's U.S. taxable income in future periods will result in dividends being fully taxable to shareholders in fiscal year 2019 and beyond. We will continue to provide updates to shareholders on this topic in the future if facts and circumstances change. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. We performed better than we expected in the seasonally slow December quarter with a sequential revenue decline of 1.8% and year-over-year growth of 12.8%, all organic growth as there was no contribution from acquisitions in the last four quarters. The Microchip 2.0 transformation continues to make good progress especially in terms of new design opportunities as we enable our clients' innovation with the very best smart, connected and secure solutions. Taking a closer look at microcontrollers, our Microcontroller business performed well in the December quarter with revenue down sequentially only 0.6% as compared to the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis the December quarter Microcontroller revenue was up a very strong 18.9%. 8-bit Microcontroller revenue actually set a new record again, edging out the September quarter performance, while 16-bit and 32-bit revenue continue to have strong year-over-year performances. Our Microcontroller portfolio and roadmap has never been stronger and we are seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time. Microcontrollers represent a 66.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. Now moving to our Analog business. Our analog revenue was sequentially down 3.2% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter, and up 1.5% on a year-over-year basis. As we highlighted at our last conference call, our publicly reported analog results continue to see some revenue classification headwinds resulting from a deliberate shift in strategy we made several quarters ago. The change in product line strategy, as we reported last quarter, is that we have for some time been adding microcontroller cores to several of our more complex analog products, especially those that provide our clients with smart connectivity solutions. The addition of microcontroller cores to these analog products enables us to sell a higher value and more defensible total system solution. These smart connectivity products are growing nicely, and as they replace older products and new designs, our revenue classification for these new products have shifted from the analog product line to our Microcontroller product line. Transitioning to more sticky and higher margin smart connectivity revenue is the right Microchip answer, but does impact some of the product line reporting that analysts are interested in as some of the revenue growth shifts into our Microcontroller product line. In the longer term, as the revenue from analog attached design wins continues to ramp, we fully expect that the analog product line revenue will grow nicely. Our analog products represented 23.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. Moving next to our licensing business. This business was up 6.8% sequentially in the December quarter and up 15.5% on a year-over-year basis, setting a new record in the process. We are seeing the fruits of having licensed several foundries and independent device makers for several years on multiple process technology nodes as they manifest in our results as the license processes ramp volume and generate royalty revenue for many years to come. Finally, our memory business was sequentially down 7.6% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter, and up 3.4% on a year-over-year basis. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2018. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018. Our December quarter financial results were good. Our net sales were slightly above the midpoint of our guidance, which itself was slightly better than five years of seasonality. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 61.4% of sales was at the high end of our guidance. Operating profit of 39.4% of sales made a new all-time record, and earnings per share of $1.36 exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.01 per share. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip worldwide for delivering an outstanding quarter and calendar year 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, this was also our 109th consecutive profitable quarter. Now I will provide you with an update on Microchip 2.0. We are continuing to experience an enormous customer preference to design with our Microcontroller solutions in all 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit customer applications. On top of that, our various acquisitions have now built a powerful diversified product line through which we are able to provide total system solutions to our customers. We are winning incremental design wins with multiple products in the same boards of our customers. We have a robust design win funnel and we feel very optimistic that Microchip 2.0 is working and increasing the organic growth of Microchip. Based on SIA numbers, our Microcontroller market share in calendar 2017 was at a record 15.7%, up 220 bps from calendar 2016. To be fair, calendar year 2016 only had three quarters of Atmel, while 2017 had all four quarters of Atmel. So I calculated market share for three quarters of 2016 to three quarters of 2017, which will be April 1 to December 31 of both years. Based on that nine-month comparison, our market share gain was 91 bps higher than 2016. Also, our Microcontroller market share grew in each of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit product lines. Now let us go into the guidance for March quarter. Our inventories at Microchip at the end of December 2017 were 115 days, which is right at our target. We were able to get to this target a quarter or so ahead of what we were thinking. This is due to enormous progress we made on the manufacturing side and bringing capacity online and decreasing lead times. Our book-to-bill ratio has also continued to moderate from 1.11 in both March 2017 and June 2017 quarters, and then the book-to-bill ratio was 1.05 in September 2017 quarter and 1.0 in December 2017 quarter. This moderation of book-to-bill reflects the improvements in lead times that we have seen or we have been able to achieve over the last several quarters. As we have indicated before, our seasonality for any given quarter will change as we integrate acquisitions and end up with a new blended seasonality. The seasonality of the Atmel business is driven by a larger percentage of consumer-oriented business, which has a sharper decline in the March quarter. In fact, the historic Atmel seasonality in the March quarter over the five years prior to the acquisition was a 7.8% sequential decline when they were an independent company. Meanwhile, Microchip's historic seasonality in the March quarter in the five years prior to acquiring Atmel was a 2.75% sequential growth. The blended average March seasonality results in a minus 1% sequential decline. You can also see the contribution from Atmel's consumer business in the stronger than seasonal blended results Microchip experienced in the June, September and December quarters of 2017. We will compare our March quarter guidance to this combined seasonality of new Microchip. So now let's go into the non-GAAP guidance for the March quarter. We expect total net sales in the March quarter to be down 3% to up 1% sequentially, giving us a midpoint of the guidance at minus 1%, which is right at seasonality that I explained about. In September quarter last year, our net sales were up 15.8% from a year ago quarter. In December quarter, our net sales were 12.8% from a year ago quarter. In March 2018 quarter, we are guiding the net sales to be up 9% from a year ago quarter, clearly demonstrating the soft landing scenario that we have been talking to the investors. Our total fiscal year 2018 sales ending March 31, 2018 with midpoint of the guidance is expected to be up 13.2% from fiscal year 2017 sales, beating most of our competitors for the same time window. Regarding gross margin, we see a steady improvement in overall gross margin of the company. Based on Microchip 2.0 margin drivers, we expect gross margin for the March quarter to be between 61.3% and 61.7% of sales. We expect overall operating expenses to be between 22% and 22.4% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 38.9% and 39.7% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $1.30 and $1.39 per share. I want to remind investors that our long-term financial model is a non-GAAP operating profit of 40% and you have seen that we are relentlessly marching towards this model. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call. With this, operator, will you please pool for questions?
Operator: Certainly. We'll take our first question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. Steve, thanks for the color in terms of book to bill and lead times. When you think through the March quarter seasonality with Atmel/Microchip combined can you help us as you go toward June in terms of what you typically see for the June quarter?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, the June and September were stronger quarters for Atmel as well as for Microchip and you have seen pretty strong June and September quarters for the last couple of years since we have had Atmel in both quarters. And you've seen the December quarter slightly stronger than our historic seasonality as we just reported. And what their results is significant difference in the March quarter seasonality where Microchip was historically up for 2.5% to 2.75%, and Atmel was down a whopping 7.8%. And that's really when you combine it together, that's what results into a minus 1% seasonality.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then maybe just a follow up for Eric. As you approach the target model and given the margin expansion you've seen, can you talk about just some of the initiatives this year and maybe on the intermediate term for both gross margins and op margins?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So, I mean, on the gross margin front it's more of the same of what we've been talking about over the past year in terms of investing and the assembly and test and bringing more of that in-house, and we're making progress on that front. We've deployed a lot of capital over the last couple of quarters, we had more coming in this quarter as we talked about in my prepared remarks on the $50 million to $60 million of capital coming in. So that will continue to add to the gross margin improvement over time. We've got good utilization in our wafer fabs and all those things are making our cost structure very favorable. At a midpoint of guidance here of about 61.5% gross margin, we've got about a 1% improvement to go to get to the target model, and we're confident that we're going to get there with all these initiatives that we have.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: And same thing on the operating margin, we just reported 39.4%, and our long-term model is 40%. And we're fairly confident that most of that gross margin will fall through and we're going to be in that range.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it.
Operator: We'll go next to William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if the inventory build is something that you had expected at the start of the quarter or if that occurred more as a result of perhaps orders not coming in with turn rates as fast as you might have expected when the quarter started?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So the inventory was pretty much right on target what we had guided to and what we achieved. The turns rate in December quarter was not soft. We beat the December quarter from the midpoint of our guidance so I don't think there was any issue in terms of our bookings in December quarter, which will have changed the inventory.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah. And you can see from the guidance that we had on our release, we think we're going to continue to be within our inventory target range of 115 to 120 days in the quarter that we're in right now, so I think inventory is well managed.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: That helps. One follow-up, if I can. You might have mentioned this, and I apologize if I missed it, but you've been talking about supply constraints on the Atmel portfolio, in particular in backend tests, and I think you've noted that you expected to be supply constrained there for – one time you said for the next year, maybe now we're at either six or nine months more. Any update on that relative to the capacity you've been adding. And I see the book-to-bill coming down and lead times coming down. Is that specifically related to the Atmel backend test? And any update there will be helpful. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So Atmel had many business units. It was just not one business, it was microcontrollers and memory and defense and aerospace and RF and automotive and wireless and other businesses. We had broad based challenges on the Atmel business, and every quarter certain products, certain business units get help you on that. And we have been guiding from the very beginning that we expect this to take until about June of this year for it to – all business to get healthy and that really hasn't changed. So as we speak right now, there is largely, I would say, one-and-a-half business units that are still having significant challenges. Most of the others are in the very tail end where a large amount of problems have been resolved. And this last one-and-a-half business unit largely chose the testing platforms to be the one that you cannot acquire any more of. These were very old testers of 1970, 1980 vintage that should have been obsoleted prior to the year 2000. And 20 years later they're still running, but they're not running, they're not running well. And the capacity on them is going down not up because every quarter you've got to take one of it down to use for spare parts because you cannot buy anymore, so therefore the capacity is decreasing not increasing. So we are bringing that testing up on those products on more modern testers or microchip platforms, but that process is painful and then qualification of customers, many of those are automotive customers. So that is the process we've been going through for the last year-and-a-half, and I think during which we have grown the business, results have been great, lead times have been slowly coming down, but some of the remaining challenges remain and we think we need another five months to get it all behind.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for the details.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Welcome.
Operator: We'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Yeah. Hey, guys. First of all, congratulations on a solid quarter. 9% growth is pretty impressive, Steve. I wanted to ask about your outlook for March. In those markets, your broad end markets, auto-industrial consumer, which one do you think is going to outperform, in your opinion, the most?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, if the question is just for the March quarter, the consumer, obviously, is the weakest.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Sure.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Automotive should do very well. Industrial should do very well. In some markets you have kind of brand new budgets coming in, in the New Year. The only market that is soft which is driving a minus 1% guidance is because of the Atmel seasonality which is usually down almost 8%, and that is driven by some of the consumer markets. Everything else should be good.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: And maybe I'll add to that on a geographic basis, this will be a strong quarter for Europe. It always is, just many more shipping days in the quarter without the holidays. Asia is the most challenged just because of the Chinese New Year, and Americas should do pretty well.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.: So Steve, as my follow-up, you guys always run the company for the long-term, and historically in lean times even you've grown inventories, your target level of inventory is 115 to 120 days. You just hit 115 days now. By all metrics, end markets are still pretty good. Does it actually make sense for you to – can you make the case that you should actually be growing your inventory levels even further and beyond the 115 days? So why stop here?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, if our inventories get below 100, then we don't have usually all the right product in the right place and all the permutations and combinations and SKUs and permutations and combinations and SKUs and flavors available, and then you go on support and you're expediting and you're going to have a lot of manufacturing challenges. When you are in the 115, 120 days of inventories and I think we can manage our business reasonably well. I mean, I wouldn't distinguish between 115, 120 or a few days left or a few days even more than that on the outer side. But we don't want to have – keep going, like you said, to have 135, 140, 150 days of inventory, because then you're not really making the right use of that inventory. We don't need that much inventory and you have the opposite risk of obsolescence where certain products, customer changes are flavored. They want to use a different package and we packaged it in and we want to keep most of the inventory and die (00:30:23) inventory. And when you do that, then its dollar value doesn't grow as much versus if you put it in the finished goods. So I think that's well-tried over the years, that's really the right kind of number. And when we are lower than that, we're trying to grow inventory, when we are higher than that we're trying to decrease inventory, and that's kind of still the right number.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Understood. Thanks, guys, and congrats.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess to start if you could talk a little bit about where lead times are in general now? You're talking about them coming down. Would you consider them at normal levels now? And just following on from that, Steve, you had talked about the soft landing that you were trying to achieve. You've got lead times down now, you had the book to bill at 1, I mean, would you consider that with what you are seeing now, that soft landing is what we're seeing now or are there are more steps that need to be taken as you go into next year in order to achieve that?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So let me have Ganesh answer the lead time, then I'll pick up on your soft landing question.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So lead times are running – if I look at the December quarter in the 4-week to about 14-week window. So if you remember, we had – at the peak of this, we've had between 4 and 20 weeks and we have started out the capacity has come on board as we're able to get our manufacturing to respond. We've been bringing that down and we fully expect that it gets a little bit farther down in the March quarter, maybe closer to about 10, 11 weeks at the top end, and then gets down to between 4 and 8 weeks which is what we would consider to be normal on about 90% of our standard line items by the June quarter, right about on the same timeline we established about a couple of quarters ago.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So picking up on the soft landing scenario, I think I would say we've pretty much demonstrated it. We're on the tail end of it. So March quarter is right at seasonality combining Atmel and Microchip together. And if June quarter grows from here, June, September are stronger quarters, then we kind of just right went through soft landing and getting back to kind of seasonality and March quarter is up 9% year-over-year. And right in the upper end of that range that we had given you and over time it gets into the middle maybe or something around that. I mean, we're not minus 10%, we're not correcting like some of the people thought we will.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Just as a follow-up on the analog business and some of your comments on that. And I think I understand what you're saying that there's growth in analog within the microcontroller market which is affecting what gets classified in the analog segment, but what does that mean going – well, I guess two questions. One is why are we seeing that now in that – are there particular product cycle transitions happening which would cause that to show up in the numbers now? And then what does that mean for the analog business going forward? Should we expect some flattening of the growth on the analog business over the next several quarters as that trend plays out?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So the transition we're going through is some of our analog business was connectivity business when it either got originally created or if it came to us from an acquisition, was largely all analog in its functionality and therefore classified as analog. As time went on, if you look at a customer's system, we then begin to see what are the other functions that are on that customer's system. And often there are microcontrollers that are there to be able to take advantage of that analog. What we did some time back was create a new set of products which effectively combined the microcontroller and the analog into a single product. And as we go win new designs – and by the way, sometimes that microcontroller was ours, in other cases the microcontroller was somebody else's. But when you take a complete solution, which is a single chip which has the microcontroller and the analog, particularly in some of these smart connectivity solutions and there's a fair amount of software that we provide, the combined solution is a far more defensible, far higher margin and far more sticky business that we have. So it creates the right answer and we don't think ahead of time should we create products that fall into analog or fall into microcontroller. We're doing what we think we need to do to be able to grow, protect and have high profitability on the products we have. So that's one part of the headwind you're seeing, so to speak, by classifying it as microcontroller versus analog. But the other side of the tailwind that is coming, and I think we will see it progress along is the standard analog products that we've had, as they get attached around our microcontroller, our new designs as we have talked about the total system solution and the whole Microchip 2.0 approach of going to market. The remaining analog products will, over time, get back some of that tailwind and have that growth. And there's a bit of cross-currents between some of the analog that is moving to microcontroller for the right reasons, and the new analog designs that will come in and give us growth. But in the long run, we fully expect that analog will be a part of the growth story for Microchip.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: By the way, if a pure analog company adds a microcontroller core to another complex product to improve performance or programmability or for any other reason, they would still call it an analog product. If exact same product existed in Maxim or Linear or Intercell or – they'll call it an analog product. But same product, if it has a microcontroller core, we put it in microcontrollers, so it's a classification difference. It doesn't change the value proposition. At the end, we have a better total solution for the customer, more sticky socket, higher ASP, higher margins and overall growing the revenue.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Sure. But just to be clear then, with that trend and the microcontroller growth on a year-on-year basis already up, as we model your analog business going forward, that trend should persist until, I guess, you said, you see that attach rate from the analog components start to rise. Is that the correct interpretation?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: It's certainly, as Ganesh described, it has some headwind because of that. Because of that classification, it puts a little tailwind on the microcontroller, a little headwind on the analog. How it will manifest itself longer-term next quarter or the quarter after and all that, we don't really yet know. It's a new phenomenon. I mean, we manage the company in an overall growth and we don't really care where you put it.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. That's fair. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. First question relates to Atmel. Company did a fantastic job of improving the margin structure of Atmel and I had thought that maybe some of that margin improvement was adjusting which end markets are being targeted with the historical Atmel products, maybe more towards automotive and industrial. Can you just talk about to what extent that was a factor or is consumer still a pretty big part of the mix? And I asked just to better understand the comment around the Atmel seasonality in March versus the historical rates.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, I mean, we have had Atmel for seven quarters. That's usually the – six quarters plus is the lead time to get a new product in production. So if you talk (00:38:44) a lot of this improvement has come from because we largely changed the flavor of which markets the products were sold, I think you miscalculated there. What we had said was Atmel had a focus on – what terminology we used, home runs, Eric?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Swinging for the fences.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Swinging for the fences. We had a focus on large account in consumer segment, swinging for the fences and some you win, some you lose, and gross margins are lower and all that. So we very largely changed the focus on where the future retention is. And true, it's automotive, it's industrial, in other areas and less on the consumer accounts. But it didn't change the existing flavor of those parts in the last several quarters till those designs were obsolete and the new designs we are focused on come to fruition. So a large majority of the margin structure change has come from improvement of pricing, disciplined pricing, dramatic cost reduction in the fab, assembly test, bringing a lot of those parts inside, reducing a large portion of the expenses, just doing the whole job overall better and rationalizing R&D, rationalizing manufacturing. But you cannot change the flavor of the business regarding what segments of business is in seven quarters. You barely touch it in seven quarters.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And then for a follow-up on capital allocation, the company had talked in previous quarters about potentially engaging in M&A now that the balance sheet has been improved. I'm curious for an update on how Microchip is thinking about that at this point, especially with the increased flexibility in your cash post the U.S. tax reform?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: We are really not thinking any differently. Post U.S. tax reform, the cash becomes easily movable from offshore that really was not easily movable before because it was permanently invested offshore. But our priorities have not changed. We continue to believe our priorities are investing in M&A first, dividend second, and our stock buyback only opportunistically. So those have not changed.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Christopher Danely with Citigroup.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, Steve. Just to talk about, I guess, the soft landing that we're all trying to engineer here. Can you give us a little more color on like specifically what would be the combined typical June seasonality for Microchip plus Atmel? And then could we be above or below that? I mean, I guess, how can we be sure that we've, I guess, landed yet in terms of the soft landing?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So I don't have the number for June quarter. It's a good question. We should have thought about it. I don't have it off the cuff. But you have seen strong June quarters for the last two years, you've seen strong September quarters for the last two years, and then you have seen stronger than historical December quarters. March quarter is right at seasonality. So it's really – that's what I'm seeing where it has landed. Therefore, the June quarter is below seasonal. If that's your concern, we think the June quarter should be pretty good, June quarter should be strong.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. And then how would you compare this slowdown or return to normal or soft landing or whatever you want to call it, versus like prior slowdowns that you've seen? Maybe talk a little bit about the linearity of bookings, how your customers feel, how the (00:42:53) feel inventory?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, I think when you look at cycles, no two cycles are really different. One, many of the prior cycles have crash landed, and this one certainly is not crash landing. We engineered a soft landing here. The other factor was in some of the prior cycles, some sort of second catalyst happened. In 2014, it was a dramatic slowdown in China that we saw at first, and four months later, everybody saw it in stocks' price significant selloff. In some prior cycles, they were driven by other factors, a tech burst in 2000 or whatever, we're going way back. I don't see any other second catalyst this time, it's just driven by getting a capacity in line, bringing the lead times down, going from a high book-to-bill ratio to a very moderating one book-to-bill ratio. I mean, at one book-to-bill ratio you can grow the business forever, just take incremental terms every quarter and the business can grow. And for 90% of our business life, the book-to-bill is around 1, right?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah, that's right.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah. And that where it should be, that means the lead times are short, people can get their product. We still have some challenges on the Atmel side in about one-and-a-half business units like I talked about and those are built-in analyses, and that part of it we still need to soft land. But it's largely there, I think. I think it's right over the runway.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Welcome.
Operator: We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, and Steve for giving us the numbers that really show the 10 percentage point difference between Atmel's first quarter calendar seasonality and what was Microchip to make sense of things. So what I wanted to do is shift over to margins and ask you about the target March model, because when I look at the business I see that with gross margins we're I think within a 100 basis points of target, with operating I think we're within 60 basis points. The team's done a spectacular job improving margins over time, and you've raised the targets multiple times, I believe. The question is as you get this close to targets, is there anything that you would see that test (00:45:42) the business would have a ceiling at those targets, or is there an opportunity to operate above those targets?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So I think what we do not want to do is on any parameter when we are above the target, or in the case of operating expense where we are below the target, then we suck that in and make that as a new target and keep thinking that the other one has to go higher. And then the operating margin goes over 40%, and then we say, well, how high is the target. The peak can't be the target. The business will oscillate over good times and bad times and very strong environments and weaker environments. 40% is a long-term target. Can it temporarily in good times go over 40%? The answer is yes, but there'll be equal times when a business is in recession and software will be less than 40%. So if you're really doing the math like you did, you're saying, well gross margin is about 100 basis points away from target and operating expenses already at target, wouldn't our operating margin go higher? Well, the answer to that is yes but that's not long-term, that's temporary. It might go there. But during huge growth we have had last year, fiscal year 2017 or 2018, we grew 13.7% or a number like that. During that same time, expenses do not keep up and you get on the lower end of the expenses. And when the business moderates sometime, then the expenses catch up a little bit because otherwise, you're not able to hire people enough in a very, very strong time. So again, you've got to give it a flex. And as managers, we don't want to be in such a tight box that every little slack, you suck it in. And then we're in such a small box, then we're just missing point one here and point two there. So think of that way. On a pure math basis, can the operating margins go higher? Yes, temporarily. We're not willing to yet admit that the longer-term margins could be higher than 40%. And the second piece of that is still the M&A strategy. I have never bought a business that makes 40% operating margin or 39.5% where we are. So whenever we buy a business, it's usually much lower, then you have to understand the flavor of its business, can we improve its growth? Can we improve its operating expense? Where does it go? And then a blended margin comes up, and usually most acquisitions result into a blended margin to be slightly lower. For example, Microchip's operating margins are still several hundred bps above the Atmel flavor of the business, so it's 39.5% total, but Microchip is well above 40% and Atmel is much lower than 40% and we're still improving it. And some of the Atmel may never get where Microchip is and we were quite honest from the beginning and say, we'll improve it substantially. We have gone from Atmel breakeven to in the mid-30%s, but it can't match mid-40%s where Microchip might be. And I'm just putting fat brackets here and not giving you where the breakdown is. So I don't know whether that helps, but don't keep making our box smaller and smaller, please, we need some room to operate.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: It's also the balance of (00:49:36) and profitability. So we've got to make sure that the investments for growth are there so that it's not just profitability but without any growth.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Speaking of growth, Ganesh, I'm going to ask a question on a business I don't think I've ever called out on the quarterly call before, but you did note the very strong sequential performance of a licensing business, and underneath that you highlighted some of the recent agreements that have been made with foundry and the growth that's being driven off that. As we look at that strong sequential growth, what does that mean and what do the recent business signings mean for the performance of that business in the immediate term, and what kind of beneficial effect does that have on the company's margin structure?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So I want to be clear that the improvement in the results are not from recent signings. Signings took place multiple years ago after which you have to go install the technology, qualify the technology, allow the technology to ramp, and then have that ramp generate royalty revenue. And royalty is the substantially larger portion of the revenue that we get from the licensing business. And that continues to layer in as by either foundry or IDM that we license it to by node that it is licensed, and it can also change based on how a given process node succeeds or doesn't succeed. So much like in our IC designs where you have to get those designs early and then work with the customer to realize the revenue, it can take 24 months, 36 months. Licensing has a similar kind of thing where what you're seeing in today's benefit are things we did one, two, three years ago. And we continue to have new licenses that we are getting signed off that will create future growth, and I think we expect licensing will contribute to the overall growth that Microchip has, and of course at a much higher level of profitability.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I would say though that on the effect of licensing on the margin, licensing is a $100 million business. So a $100 million business at a higher gross margin than Microchips overall, but Microchip is at a $4 billion dollar run rate roughly. It's just really a small needle mover. There are equal number of other various business units where certain products are much higher gross margins, certain other products are less gross margin, and the mix moves forward and sometimes one has a stronger growth, the other has strong growth. True, licensing business is accretive to the gross margin, but at $100 million or a $400 million, it doesn't dominate.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We'll go next to Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Adam J. Gonzales - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Yeah, this is Adam Gonzales on for Vivek. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering how we should think about your CapEx moving into fiscal 2019 in the context of some of the views you've laid out on the demand environment in a relative supply-demand balance? Thanks.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So we haven't gone through our annual operating plan process for fiscal 2019 yet so we're not ready to give a number on that as it is. We have made significant investments as last year, we have goals to bring the assembly and tests that we do internally hire and that will require investment. But I don't think we're ready to give – provide the street with a number yet for next year's CapEx. Still going to be a small percentage of overall net sales.
Adam J. Gonzales - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And I guess just one quick follow-up. I know this is a bit nitpicky on the seasonality issue, but in the March quarter, you guys are down 1% quarter-on-quarter, what's different this year versus last year? I mean, you had Atmel for a full quarter then and sales over 2% sequentially, so just what was better than seasonal in March versus this year?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: That's kind of what threw everybody off. Last quarter was very noisy. The – not the last quarter, March quarter last year was very noisy. We had just gone go live on January 1. There were a bunch of orders that were pushed out into the quarter. There were just – there were a lot of moving parts and there was a large amount of delinquency we had carried in the prior quarter of December, some of it we were able to meet. We were new to that business. It was the first March quarter we had had. Atmel had also left a fair amount of pricing and all that on the table. We talked about it and we were seeing a significant impact of price increases we had done which matched some of the seasonality. There were just way too many moving parts.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Plus the environment was stronger in March last year.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, not that environment is weak now though, but it's certainly not as strong as a year ago. So I think that's what threw everybody else off. And...
Adam J. Gonzales - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay.. Thanks very much.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I think this time there's no such noise, and this is a true seasonality with Atmel.
Adam J. Gonzales - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Got it.
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thanks. And congratulations on the quarter. Going to the Microchip 2.0 strategy of platforms, how is that affecting your pressure on ASPs. You had mentioned before, Steve, that industry consolidation, you're seeing less pressure, but is this helping maybe even lift ASPs?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, I mean, the answer to that is yes. I mean, I don't know if the ASPs continuously go up, but we are severely resisting the pressure to give year-over-year declines in large majority of the cases we're succeeding and are able to hold our ASPs, plus as we add a microcontroller intelligence to analog, as we attach analog around microcontroller will be more input into the customer to have a total solution. In general, you can bundle and it's more sticky and it helps ASP. All that is happening. But I mean, semiconductor ASPs do not constantly go up. I think if you can have them not go down, that will be good enough.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah. It avoids commoditization of the individual products when you can take a complete solution and have this (00:56:23) show the customer the value in doing that.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. And maybe and even on the OpEx side is, your platforms, are the designs robust enough that you can win designs without Microchip employees or FAEs being involved?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, across 115,000-plus customers, a vast majority of the customers we don't have Microchip FAEs involved. You just can't have that many employees covers, so there is a large amount of effort in us building reference designs, documenting, training on the web, training in person. W train 30,000 engineers around the world in various masters' conferences, seminars and webinars and onsite customer training. So there is a – Microchip is huge. Microchip is a very vast training organization teaching our customers how to do it. And then, there is a lot of self-start help and all that where customers are designing a product. Vast majority of Microchip's customers, you do not have a Microchip FAE involved in helping them in their design. There's a Microchip FAE involved in overall general training with which they do their design. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to have enough people.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Welcome.
Operator: We'll go next to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. From a geographical perspective on a year-over-year basis, you're driving growth in all of your geographies, so demand looks pretty broad based. But one of the geographies that kind of stands out is the Americas region, growth was up 5% versus the rest of the fees that were up at least double that rate. Any reason for the slower growth in the Americas region?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, the problem is we count the revenue where the product is shipped not where the product is designed. So manufacturing largely keeps moving out of Americas, and I don't know whether it will change in the coming years. So when you look at 5% Americas growth, it artificially understates it when internally we look at the revenue in the Americas counting back the revenue which was generated in America and shipped overseas and Americas growth was great. It was just as good as any other geography. It wasn't weak.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Thanks for the insights there. And then...
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: But we report actually it's where we shipped it.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. It seems like the team has gained quite a bit of traction with these analog products with the integrated MCU cores for these, what do you guys call, smart connectivity solutions. Can you guys just give us some examples of where these type of connectivity solutions are used, applications or end markets? And when you say connectivity, are you talking about both wired and wireless connectivity integrated with your MCUs?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Go ahead.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: It's both. So let's take one example which probably you have but you're not familiar with. Your car has a USB hub in it. And depending on the vintage of your car, that is a hub that has progressed over time from at one time being largely an analog-only solution to today being a smart connectivity solution where that hub has a way to recognize what is being attached to it, has a way to either be a slave or a master. It has a way to control your display, and of course, power the devices connected to it. So it's a far smarter hub today than it was several years ago. Several years ago we would've called that an analog product. And as the new designs have gone into production, those we would call as a microcontroller product.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: You could take a different market – take a thermostat, a large number of thermostats nationwide, you can access them now through your phone or pad. I know I can access the thermostats in my house on my phone remotely while traveling, turn the temperature off or down or up. Or if I'm going to be on business for longer than was anticipated, I can keep the house turned off. Those are all connectivity solutions where you're doing it wirelessly. And it would have a micro Wi-Fi or a micro and a Bluetooth, for example, on the same chip, rather than two chips. The large number of speakers in the home, you don't connect them anymore. You simply Bluetooth it from your phone into the speaker and the sound is coming. You don't really access the music through a box or something anymore these days. I mean, you can still do that, most times you access the music through the phone and just Bluetooth into any of the speakers in your home. That's connectivity wirelessly.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: You can take those same general examples and apply it to Ethernet to CAN, to various forms of wireless and so on and so forth.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Thanks for the insights. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: We'll go next to Gil Alexandre with Darphil Investments.
Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates: Good evening. When you look at your business, you still see revenues growing at 7% to 9% over the next few years. And...
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yes. As we are driving our business, we are modeling our business and looking at the impact of 2.0, those are the targets we are driving towards.
Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates: And as you look at the business now, how strong do you find the Asian business and the European business?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Last year, all three businesses were very strong. If you look at just on a quarterly basis, March quarter has the Chinese New Year, so Asian business in the current quarter is always weak. European business in the March quarter, they're the strongest geography in the March quarter, and America is normal. If you look at the December quarter, usually with all the holidays and all that, Europe and America businesses were weak, and Asia business was okay. So each quarter, it's kind of slightly different. When you go to June quarter, Asia business rebounds strongly from Chinese New Year quarter of March to June. I don't know if that helps.
Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates: All right. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Due to no response from Rajvindra (01:03:41), we'll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Steve, congratulations on the solid results, especially on the operating margin. Steve, one of the questions I had, over the last several months as you talked about sort of the soft landing scenario, you kind of alluded to the potential that you could keep every quarter this calendar year in that sort of high-single digit long-term revenue growth target. Is that still kind of the way you see this calendar year playing out? And I guess secondly, if it is, do you get there on just seasonal growth sequentially or will it take some above seasonal quarters?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: John, I don't know, I think this March quarter Atmel seasonality last year kind of threw everybody off, I would say including us. And as we really dove into it and looked at our backlog and look at the business and then analyzed prior five years of Atmel business and the behavior of these large swinging for the fences accounts and design wins, the last year's performance kind of threw it off and those accounts still had a problem last year. But it was kind of overcome by the general halo of price increases and a lot of under-marketing of AVRs and all that that Atmel had done and where we improved the position, stronger distribution, and things like that. So the number of things last year kind of threw it off, and I guess all of us together somehow didn't quite capture the blended March seasonality. So that's what we are adjusting to. So give us a little time to get our feet back on the earth and really see what effect it has on the rest of the quarter. I mean, economy is not bad, bookings are not bad, the business is not bad. We're getting strong turns, our inventory is right. We're not in a massive inventory correction mode of any kind. There's really no problem in business. We're doing well. And when you do the calculation like we have shared, we are right on target. But obviously...
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's helpful. And, Steve...
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Go ahead.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Well, just anecdotally, for me one of the things that's always important as we kind of orchestrate the soft landing as book-to-bill and lead times come in, are you seeing any sort of unusually high cancelation patterns or different order patterns from your customers, or are they responding to your ability to meet demands in an orderly fashion?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah. So they're just responding to us shipping into a more orderly fashion. If you recall, last March to last June, the bookings were not any stronger, the book-to-bill was exactly the same because we informed the customers of lead time, they responded with higher orders out in time to respond to their lead time. And as the lead times have come in, then customers that are adjusting to their lower lead time and don't have to place outer bookings which is then lowering the book-to-bill ratio, and now it's at parity and it's moderating so customers are essentially giving us as many bookings as they need and don't have to give huge bookings out in time. This is almost perfect landing, I think, so far. The only difference, I think, street had higher expectations for March looking at March seasonality last year which was kind of typical Microchip, and basically there were lots of other factors in the business, pricing and others which match that seasonality. And this year, December to March, we can't.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you, Steve.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: And obviously, result is some of the other quarters have to be stronger and I think they will be and hopefully they will be. Certainly, last year they were/ March, June, September, December, they were all stronger, and this year should be the same. Next couple of quarters should be stronger because of that March seasonality.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Welcome.
Operator: We'll go next to Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities.
Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.: Thanks for squeezing me in. Hey, Steve, can you give us a rundown on the competitive dynamic in 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit? Have things changed over the past several years and so on? Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: The number of competitors continues to be reasonably – a reasonable number of good strong competitors. We have continued to move up that ranking and so we have been gaining share in all of these product lines, including the overall microcontrollers as well. Some of these competitors have had various challenges relative to either their capacity. In some cases they're being acquired or not, so there have been those kind of things that are taking place there. But microcontrollers remains a competitive product line, a competitive market and I think that more rational actors today than they were perhaps five years ago. And they are responding, in some cases more so, or in some cases less so to the consolidation that's taking place, and that certainly helps as well. So nothing dramatic to report that is different about our competitive dynamics in microcontrollers.
Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.: And Ganesh as a...
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I mean our Microcontrollers – I'm sorry...
Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.: I just want to say...
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Microcontrollers business is up, I think almost, 19% last year. It was higher than Microchip's growth and higher than the industry growth in that segment. Based on FIA numbers, we gained share in all three 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, and I shared with you the overall share gain by 90 bps almost. So I think things are good.
Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.: Okay. Would it be safe to say that the average microcontroller actor out there is not using price as a way to gain share, it's more a value proposition?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I don't really know if just gaining share by price has ever worked in microcontroller. These are complex parts, and over time we have shown surveys when you ask a customer what do you consider for choosing a microcontroller, the most frequent answer is the ecosystem, the tools, the support, qualities, the reliability, the customer, the samples, development tools and everything else. Price is one other factor. So these are not commodity products, it takes two years for the customer to go to production after they have made the device selection. So price has never been really the way to gain share, but there were players in the market that were irresponsive. They will drop the price too quickly and not stand up and fight to really maintain their price. And some of those have disappeared or some of those have become better and more responsible. But overall, I don't think price has been a mechanism to gain share in the market ever.
Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.: Okay, good. Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, thank you, everybody, for joining our conference call and we'll see some of you on the road at the various conferences we might go to. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Second Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
James Bjornholt: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2018 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Net sales in the September quarter were a record $1.012 billion, well above our guidance and up 4.1% sequentially from net sales of $972.1 million in the immediately preceding quarter. This was Microchip's first quarter with more than a $1 billion in sales. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.04% in the September quarter and above the high end of our guidance, which was 60.75%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 22.46% of sales, well just below the low end of our guidance of 22.5%. And non-GAAP operating income was a record 38.6%, well above the high end of our guidance of 38.25%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $344.1 million and was up 7.9% on a sequential basis and up 56.7% as compared to the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.41, which was $0.06 higher than the midpoint of our guidance of $1.35. On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 60.7% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.7 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $388.7 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $120.9 million, share based compensation of $19.9 million, $0.7 million of acquisition-related and other costs and special charges of $19.9 million, consisting primarily of a $19.5 million charge for fees associated with transitioning from the public utility provider in Oregon to a lower-cost direct access provider. This change is expected to provide significant expense and cash flow savings in the future. After these adjustments, GAAP net income was a record $189.2 million or $0.77 per diluted share. The non-GAAP tax rate was 9.1% in the September quarter, and the GAAP tax rate was a negative 1.6% for the quarter. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at September 30, 2017, was $456.9 million. Microchip had 105 days of inventory at September 30, 2017, up 5 days from the end of the June quarter. Inventory days are still well below our targeted levels but are starting to improve from our significant capacity expansion efforts as well as selective and opportunistic buy-aheads of constrained materials. Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter continued to be low at 31 days and were flat to the June quarter levels. The cash flow from operating activities was a record $350.1 million in the September quarter. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $1.844 billion, of which about $550 million is domestic cash. We bought back 15.1 million of our 2,037 convertible bonds in the December quarter where the bondholders had elected to convert. We expect the remaining principal amount of $17.3 million of the 2,037 2 1/8% convertible bonds to either be converted by the bondholders or called by Microchip during the December 2017 quarter. The call date for these bonds is December 15, 2017. Capital expenditures were $59.9 million in the September 2017 quarter. We expect about $70 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for the fiscal year 2018 to be about $200 million to $220 million, up from our prior guidance of $180 million as we capitalize on growth and cost reduction opportunities. We are aggressively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margin improvements to our business, particularly for the Atmel manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Our capital spending also reflects 3 new buildings we are constructing in Arizona, India and Germany, which will give us meaningful lease cost reductions and avoidance in the future as well as allow us to cost-effectively scale for our future growth. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $29.9 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with how our product lines performed in the September quarter with overall sequential revenue growth of 4.1% and year-over-year growth of 15.8%, all organic growth as there was no contribution from acquisitions in the last 4 quarters. The Microchip 2.0 transformation continues to make strong progress, especially in terms of new design opportunities as we enable our clients' innovation with the very best smart, connected and secure solutions. Taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business has performed strongly in the September quarter, with revenue being up 4.7% sequentially as compared to the June quarter, setting a new record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, the September quarter microcontroller revenue was up a very strong 20%. All microcontroller product lines, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, set new revenue records. Our microcontroller portfolio and roadmap has never been stronger, and we are seeing continued growth in our design end funnel, which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time. Microcontrollers at almost $2.7 billion in annualized revenue, represented 65.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter.  To put our recent performance into perspective, in the last 5 quarters, we have grown our annualized microcontroller revenue by over $0.5 billion. All our microcontroller product lines are firing on all cylinders and driving differential growth and market share gains. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we advance the Microchip 2.0 transformation and further strengthen the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry Now moving to our analog business. Our analog revenue was sequentially flat in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter, and up 6.3% on a year-over-year basis and also set a new record by a whisker in the process. Our analog results over the last two quarters were negatively impacted by two factors, first, the back-end capacity constraints on products with Atmel heritage, which we discussed at the last earnings call, have taken more time to resolve as the lead time for new back-end equipment has been longer-than-expected, reflecting the strong industry conditions that our suppliers are also seeing; and second, we have been adding microcontroller cores to several of our more complex analog products, especially those that provide our clients with smart connectivity solutions. This enables us to subsume competitive microcontrollers which were sitting next to our analog products as well, as include the connectivity firmware in our products so that they form total system solutions and are, therefore, much stickier design wins. These smart connectivity products are ramping nicely. And as they replace older products in new designs, our revenue classification for these new products has shifted from the analog product line to a microcontroller product line.  Transitioning to more sticky and higher-margin smart connectivity revenue is the right Microchip answer, but does impact some of the product line reporting that analysts are interested in as some of the revenue growth shifts into our microcontroller product line.  As our back-end capacity constraints continue to get relieved and the revenue from analog attach design wins start to ramp, we fully expect that the analog product line revenue will grow at or above Microchip's overall growth rate.  At over $950 million in annualized revenue, our analog products represent a 23.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We continue to successfully find more opportunities to attach Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel microcontrollers and microprocessors at multiple customers and applications. This effort should pay dividends over time as these new design wins go to production. And we are developing and introducing a wide range of new innovative and proprietary products in the linear, mixed signal, power, interface, timing and security products lines to fuel the future growth of our analog products as we march relentlessly towards making analog a greater than $1 billion annualized revenue business for Microchip soon and a much larger business in the coming years. Moving next to our licensing business. This business is up 3% sequentially in the September quarter and up 8.9% on a year-over-year basis, also setting a new record in the process. We are seeing the fruits of having licensed several foundries and independent device makers for several years on multiple process technology nodes manifest in our results as the licensed processes generate royalty revenue for many years to come. Last but not least, our memory business was sequentially up 5.3% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. There are significant cost reductions underway for this business using the combined strength of Microchip and Atmel. We believe that this effort will make us even more competitive and further improve our gross margins.  Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Stephen Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2018. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2018. I will also provide update on capacity enhancement activities, lead times as well as Microchip 2.0. Our September quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our net sales were a new record and above our guidance, first time ever our net sales crossed a very important milestone of being above $1 billion for the quarter. Our net sales for this quarter were up 15.8% from the September quarter of a year ago, and this revenue comparison is not impacted by any acquisition since Atmel's full quarter revenue was in the September 2016 quarter results. Our non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share each exceeded the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 50% from the September quarter of a year ago due to improving sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage and successful execution of our core business as well as accretion from our acquisitions. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip worldwide for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 108th consecutive profitable quarter. There are 3 other points I would like to make on our sales growth, first, every one of our major product lines, 8-bit MCU, 16-bit MCU, 32-bit MCU, analog, wireless, licensing, memory and others, were up significantly in the September 2017 quarter over the year-ago quarter; number two, every major geography, North America, Europe and Asia, were up significantly in the September 2017 quarter over the year-ago quarter; and number three, sales in all end-markets were up in September 2017 quarter over the year-ago quarter. Now I will provide you with an update on Microchip 2.0. We are continuing to experience an enormous customer preference to design with our microcontrollers solutions in all 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit customer applications. On top of that, our various acquisitions have now built a powerful diversified product line through which we're able to provide total system solutions to our customers. We are winning incremental design wins with multiple products in the same boards of our customers. We have a robust design win funnel, and we feel very optimistic that Microchip 2.0 is working and increasing the organic growth of Microchip. A year ago, in September 2016 quarter, our microcontroller market share in 8-, 16- and 32-bit combined was 14.46% as per the SIA numbers. In September 2017 quarter, our market share is up to 15.84%, an increase of 138 bps in 1 year.  Now before I go into the guidance for the December quarter, I will say that we are continuing to see good business environment for our products worldwide and have a number of company-specific demand drivers. Our inventories at Microchip as well as the distributors are towards the low end of our normal range. We are continuing to slowly add incremental capacity at various bottlenecks. With that, our lead times have stabilized, with stable lead times we're engineering a soft landing so far without triggering any double ordering or panic from our customer base. Our book-to-bill ratio has moderated from 1.11 in both March and June quarters to 1.05 in September quarter as the lead times stabilize. We expect the book-to-bill ratio to come down further as lead times continue to moderate, hence engineering and soft landing. At the rate we are adding capacity, we believe that it will still take us through June 2018 when our lead times return to fully normal. Now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We expect total net sales in the December quarter to be about flat to down 4%, which, at the midpoint, represents a growth of approximately 12.6% on a year-over-year basis. I want to remind investors that in the last 5 years, we had 3 acquisitions that closed in the middle of September quarter.  SMSC closed in August of fiscal year '13. ISSC closed in July of fiscal year '15, and Micrel closed in August of fiscal year '16. All these 3 acquisitions had a partial quarter revenue in September quarter and a full quarter revenue in the December quarter. Therefore, mathematically taking the average of the last 5 years of sequential growth would give you a false number. Excluding acquisitions, the average sequential decline in the December quarter over the past 5 years has been 2.5%, and ranged between plus 0.8% and minus 4.9%. Investors should compare our guidance for December quarter of flat to down 4% with an average 5-year seasonal performance of minus 2.5% in net sales and against the backdrop of a 1% beat of our FQ2 revenue guidance. Regarding gross margins, we see a steady improvement in overall gross margin of the company based on Microchip 2.0 margin drivers that we have discussed with the investors. We expect gross margin for the December quarter to be between 61% and 61.4% of sales. We expect overall operating expenses to be between 22.2% and 22.6% of sales, and we expect operating profit percentage to be between 38.4% and 39.2% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $1.30 and $1.40 per share non-GAAP. I want to remind investors that our long-term financial model is a non-GAAP gross margin of 62.5%, operating expense of 22.5% and operating profit of 40%. And as you have seen, we are relentlessly marching towards this model. And we expect our longer-term annual revenue growth to be high single-digits.  We believe we can grow above the industry driven by four factors, we can achieve about 1% to 2% extra growth due to our traditional market share growth continuing; we can achieve an additional 1% to 2% growth due to higher attach rate from our total system solution approach; we can achieve 1% to 2% higher growth from much less ASP erosion or stable ASPs, and we can achieve 1% to 2% higher growth from our distributor partnership approach versus competitors pulling back. And we have judged it down due to confounding effects to yield a 7% to 9% growth going forward. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we expect that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to First Call. With this, operator, will you please pool for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll now take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya: Steve, if you look over the last year, growth has been very strong for you guys. Can you give us a sense of how much of that has been sort of company-specific? How much of that has been the macro? Because I think what most investors are trying to get a sense for is how much of this growth is actually sustainable as we look out into the near-to-intermediate term.
Stephen Sanghi: Well, it's very, very difficult. Customers don't have a good answer for -- that you're giving me this design. I'm winning this design. Is it because industry is doing well, or we are winning more than that? So that is a very, very hard to decipher. If you look at our last quarter, our year-over-year growth was 15.8%. We're not guiding to that. We're not expecting that. We're expecting a growth going forward of 7% and 9% with the December quarter guided at about 12.6% over the prior year December. So growth will moderate from these high numbers, and some of that excess is driven by the industry conditions.
Vivek Arya: All right. And as a follow-up, in the last few days, there's been a lot of M&A excitement in semis. And I'm wondering how you were thinking about M&A given that your leverage is at a very, very comfortable level. And at what point would you decide that it is better to resume buybacks instead of maybe going after assets that might be marked-up but with all the excitement in the industry?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, our capital allocation strategy and our thoughts have not changed since we discussed with all of you many times. Our first reference is to utilize our cash for our operations, R&D and other activities, but those are very well-funded into the P&L, and we do not need to really reach out into the balance sheet to spend excess cash. The second priority is to utilize our cash towards M&A. Our second priority is to maintain the dividend, keep growing its small amount incrementally, like we are, but not really have a very large incremental dividend program. Then our next priority is to utilize our cash for M&As. And our last priority is really to buy stock back, which we only do opportunistically.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: I guess, I just want to go back to the increase in the CapEx budget. Eric, you did, in your prepared comments, gave a sort of a good rundown of what's driving that. You did say there will be some cost savings because of that. I'm just kind of curious, does that put you sort of towards your target margin or above the target margin? And if you can help me understand what percent of the increase in CapEx is going because you just feel better about the demand, overall demand environment, versus bringing more stuff in-house?
James Bjornholt: Well, we've been talking about, for the last several quarters, there are a lot of margin improvement that we can get by bringing a lot of the outsourced Atmel activity in-house, and the percentages of our internal production versus where they've historically are out of line with where we'd like them to be. So we're making these incremental investments, and there are significant gross margins to come. We think that by making these investments, we can get to our 40% operating margins and the 62.5% gross margin goal. And it's gradual. These things come over a steady period of time. There's only so much our manufacturing and operations teams can do in any given quarter. But we've laid out a pretty aggressive plan for us to increase the production capabilities in-house, and the gross margin will improve from there.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then Steve, maybe as my follow-up, just to follow-on to Vivek's question about M&A. You've always been very disciplined about the price you're willing to pay for an asset. I think in the past, you've said, for every deal you've done, you've probably vetted and walked away from 3 or 4 deals. I'm just kind of curious. With Microchip 2.0 and your confidence level increasing that you can grow revenue faster than the industry, does that change the parameters around asset value you're willing to pay on the M&A front? And just given where the SOX index is now, any comment around asset value to your perception there would be helpful.
Stephen Sanghi: There is really no change. We have strong filters in place in our M&A analysis, which are multidimensional in terms of multiples and revenue and gross margin, operating profit growth rates and others. I can't give you all those filters, but it's a fairly complex metrics that we have to check off. And really, at various times, the assets available outside could be on the lower end of that metrics or could be on the higher end of the metrics. But they're always companies that fit the metrics. And if they go on the higher end of the metrics and even beyond that, and they're too expensive and we won't do it, but there are always companies available which still fall in the metrics.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach: Just a question on just the microcontroller share and as you tick through some of the things that should allow you to grow above the industry in high single-digit growth, any particular end-markets or product segments that you'd call out in terms of where you're seeing the best market share positioning?
Ganesh Moorthy: We don't go-to-market with an end-market view in order to be able to grow. We have a very broad approach to markets, applications, and a broad product line to go after them. Clearly, as the end markets strengthen in one area and other, we get participation incrementally from there. We've shown you how our automotive and industrial market share, when we presented it about 6 months ago, was that 60% of the overall revenue for us. And of course, those industries have been helping as they've had some strength. But we don't have a particular end-market that is driving us in one direction or another.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. And then just a follow-up question for Steve. Appreciate all the color on some of the cyclical barometers around lead times and book-to-bill. As you try to kind of navigate to a soft landing, is there anything different in terms of this cycle versus prior cycles, whether it's competition with distributors and customers, inventory you're holding to kind of help navigate through that?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, I think, the lead times did not get as long this time as, clearly, they have gotten some other times. The customer behavior and the distributor behavior has been much more normal this time than we have seen in the other times. So I think everybody has behaved. We wrote a letter back in April informing our customers that the industry conditions were strengthening and the lead times are going out. In the March quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.11. And we wrote the letter on April 4, after we had seen this very strong bookings. And in the June quarter, our book-to-bill was, again, 1.11, which means, really, there was no panic created. No customers rushed to place large orders. They kept doing what they were doing before the letter and conformed to our lead time and placed the orders to conform to the longer lead times. And then in December quarter, book-to-bill ratio came down to 1.05 as some of the products where the lead times have moderated, and the lead times right now are anywhere from 4 weeks to 20 weeks with the products all over the place. But the products where the lead times have become shorter, the bookings on them have moderated because people have the orders in place. So I think it's a much more behaved environment this time than kind of we have seen before. I do not know what's happening with the competitors and the rest of the industry. There are scattered cases where the customer isn't willing to take one of our products because he cannot complete the kit. There's a product coming from one of the competitors or other analogs or other companies where he needs to build his entire products. And if that one is not available, they don't want ours either. But same can be said by those competitors that one of our products wasn't available so their product didn't sell. But those are scattered cases. It's not all over the place. I think environment is pretty reasonable and reasonably well-behaved.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein: You spoke in the prepared remarks about subsuming competitive microcontrollers when they're next to your analog products. It sounds almost like the cross-selling opportunity is being driven from analog to the digital MCU. I would have thought that the cross-selling opportunity was much more in the other direction. Can you elaborate on this, help us understand that dynamic a little bit?
Ganesh Moorthy: It happens in both directions. So in many cases where we have the microcontroller at the center of the design, we see the breadth of what else surrounds that microcontroller early and are able to attach products. There are some specific cases where it's very complex analog and especially when it's smart connectivity, where, in addition to the analog and the connectivity function, it needs a microcontroller. And we, in many cases, enter those businesses through some of the acquired entities. We didn't have our micro controllers there to begin with. But once we now see where we are on the analog from a smart connectivity standpoint, we can begin to see what else can we subsume. And that's where it goes in the opposite direction, where the strength that came from analog gives us the ability to attach microcontrollers and, in many cases, do an integrated product that gives us more complete total system solutions in that application.
William Stein: That's helpful. If I can squeeze in one follow-up. I just want to make sure -- it's really clarification point of the last question that someone else asked. It sounds like perhaps the shortages on the passive side have been sort of clipping overall demand. I think you mentioned a moment ago about if a customer can't get a complete kit because he's short, say, a capacitor and he doesn't want your product, at least not yet until he can do a full kit, did I understand that as sort of the dynamic that might have contributed to sort of soft landing where things didn't get out of hand because, let's say, passives or some other product clipped the peak demand rate?
Stephen Sanghi: So I don't know if the others are seeing a massive number of cases where they're not able to ship the product because some passive product is not available. I think I'm kind of just seeing it sporadically where it's not large enough that, that becomes an excuse, where a number, the one way or the other. I think it's a noise level, but it's certainly a factor. It's possible that, for some other people, it's a much larger factor.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Christopher Caso: I just want to talk a little bit about the efforts to build inventory and the timing of that. With demand slowing a bit seasonally in the December quarter, does that give you the ability to catch up on inventory somewhat? Or is that to wait until more capacity is in place a couple of quarters from now? And then with that, I have to imagine there's some gross margin benefit as you run the fabs a little harder to build the inventory. Can you quantify that benefit and talk about how that works its way into 2018?
Stephen Sanghi: So the way I will answer is, it's a continuous phenomenon. It is not digital where inventory doesn't grow this quarter, and a couple of years from now, it all grows to the right level. Our inventory grew by 5 days last quarter. Inventory will grow by some days this quarter and grow some again in March. And by June, we expect to try to get to the models. So it's a continuous phenomenon. In the stronger quarter, like we have had in the last 2 or 3 quarters, inventory was harder to grow because even though we added capacity, produced more units, we largely shipped them into the growth. Current quarter is seasonally a weak quarter, seasonally the weakest quarter of the year. So this quarter, the incremental capacity we're adding gives us the chance to add a little bit to the inventory because we can produce more than the weaker demand. But it's a continuous phenomenon. It's really not waiting for something to happen 2 quarters from now.
Ganesh Moorthy: The other thing to keep in mind is our distribution inventory is at the low end of their range as well. So us having a little extra inventory helps as we go into the growth quarters. So that combined, we have the right amount of inventory for the market.
Christopher Caso: And I'm sorry, the margin impact as the inventory is building?
Stephen Sanghi: So margin impact is essentially doesn't care about whether inventory is building or not. It cares about overall production. If you produce more in wafers assembly test, then it has better absorption and has an accretive effect. So we have been producing more units every quarter, and you have seen the margin going up every quarter. So that's also a continuous phenomenon.
Christopher Caso: Okay. As a follow-up, you had talked in your prepared remarks about a number of factors for why you think you grow faster than the inventory growing forward and what the impact would be. Can you talk about that looking backwards over the last year? And I know some factors are more difficult to measure than others. But perhaps give us a walk-through, perhaps some of these factors. And I think market share. You talked about, a little bit, pricing, how that may have affected your revenue growth over the last years compared to the industry, and what we'd say, Microchip 1.0, I guess.
Stephen Sanghi: Well, it's very difficult to numerically assign to the history and take our 15.8% growth last quarter over the previous 1 year and figure out what portion happened with price increase, what portion happened with gaining market share, what portion happened with what because it's impossible to do, 115,000-plus customers and 100,000 SKUs we are shipping. But the 4 elements that drove it in the last year and will continue to drive it going forward is really the traditional market share gains, better ASP management, either stable ASPs or increasing ASPs or less erosion. It depends on various product lines. And then achieving higher growth from our distributor partnerships, where a number of competitors are pulling back in their distribution programs, and distributions are focusing attention on us. And the total systems approach where Ganesh talked about is happening both ways, we're able to win the microcontroller where we had a lot of analog parts by giving them a combined integrated part. And at the same time, where the customer doesn't want an integrated part, we're able to replace the competitor's analog because we have our micro end, so from both of those factors. When you combine it together, if you take 1% to 2% growth for those 4 factors, it kind of becomes 4% to 8% incremental, and we kind of have judged it down overall to come up with a 7% to 9% growth, counting the growth of the industry, whatever your assumptions are, plus a little bit more that we can do.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Chris Danely with Citi.
Christopher Danely: Steve, so you said that as the lead times are coming and the book-to-bill is dropping a little bit, is it possible that if the lead times dropped fairly suddenly in this quarter, that book-to-bill could be below 1 for the March quarter and you could potentially see some below-normal seasonality?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, we are not seeing it, and we're not expecting it because there's not big capacity increments coming in because the lead time for equipment is large. Many of the test equipment, fab and other equipment, there's a lot of semiconductors that go into them. So our equipment suppliers aren't able to produce the product. And their lead times are long because they can't acquire all the semiconductors they need. So there is not big bulk of capacity coming in. Capacity is coming incrementally. And that's why I said, I think it's -- capacity is coming incrementally, and lead times are moderating slowly. And that kind of all leads to a soft landing rather than a contraction.
Christopher Danely: Okay, great. And then for my follow-up. Okay, you're talking about 7% to 9% long-term growth, and like you said, analog slowed down to, like, I think it was 6% year-over-year growth. So would you expect the microcontroller business to grow faster than analog going forward? And what would be driving like a reacceleration on the analog revenue growth?
Stephen Sanghi: I think what drives the reacceleration in analog is Atmel acquisition was a little over a year ago. And usually, you have 1 year, 1.5 years design cycle. So with Atmel, we acquired a large amount of microcontroller business. I think it was about $600 million, $700 million of their business was microcontroller, which those sockets had 0 microchip analog around it. We were the enemy. So it was anybody's analog except ours. So that was a very, very large opportunity we identified for you. We are just in the front-end of it going to production. So I think that's what accelerates the analog. Don't be fooled by just last couple of quarters of lower analog growth because, in some cases, we were already producing the integrated product. It was analog with microcontroller. And we were able to sell the package to the customer. And therefore, the revenue shifted. Rather than putting it in the analog bucket, we've put it in the microcontroller bucket.
Ganesh Moorthy: We still have that analog. It's just it's coming in [indiscernible]
Stephen Sanghi: We still have that analog, but it's counted as part of the microcontroller revenue. 98%, 99% of our microcontroller has a large amount of analog on it. But the revenue still counts as a microcontroller revenue.
James Bjornholt: Right. Any product that we ship that has a microcontroller core, we classify as a microcontroller product.
Stephen Sanghi: That's not different for anybody. Our competitors do the same. All 32-bit micro, 16-bit, 8-bit micro, they all have some power management, converters, supervisors, LDOs. And analog is built into the microcontrollers. So that's why you saw -- and there were some large designs where we captured that, and it can depress that analog sequential growth for a couple of quarters. I will not be fooled by it. There's a large amount of analog attach rate coming around Atmel's microcontrollers soon.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll now take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: You were at your target OpEx ratio in the September quarter. You'll be there as well in the December quarter. Actually, a bit better than that. So clearly, you guys are continuing to drive OpEx leverage. And I think on a go-forward basis, I think the team is going to continue to drive revenue growth faster than OpEx growth. So is there a new OpEx ratio target that we should be thinking about?
Stephen Sanghi: We have not revised them, and we're not thinking of revising them. We believe our long-term target is 22.5%. In good times, we happen to be slightly below that. And in discretionary time in the future, we could be slightly higher than that by 25 bps or something. Basically, within the range. We're not calling for substantial OpEx leverage going forward. And if the times continue to be very, very strong and the growth happens to be well above the mean, you could temporarily be in that situation. But longer-term, we've got to make the investments to grow the business.
Harlan Sur: Okay. The team is clearly executing on the Microchip 2.0 initiatives, system-level focus, more content per board. You guys have a lot of analytics platforms in-house that tracks design wins, tracks content per board. It seems like this is a contributor to the strong year-over-year growth. Can you guys quantify content increase per board on a year-over-year basis? Or any other metrics that you use to gauge success in terms of value capture per system?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, we have a propriety indicator. We certainly don't want competitors or anybody else to know. So for the last several years, we have been tracking average number of Microchip's parts per customer design. And that is growing, and growing significantly. So that is the measure of the success of the TSS effort. We want to share that success with you qualitatively, not quantitatively.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin Cassidy: Just within your microcontroller business, can you say which products are growing the fastest, both on units and revenue?
Stephen Sanghi: I would think 32-bit microcontrollers are growing the fastest, 16-bit microcontrollers next and 8-bit microcontroller next. Given that, all 3 are making record quarter-after-quarter.
Kevin Cassidy: Right. So not so much on a like-to-like basis. Your ASPs, in general, are trending up because you're selling more 32-bit.
Stephen Sanghi: That could be true if you just look at the average microcontroller ASP. But then the average COGS would be going up, too, because 32-bit products cost more to make it than 8 or 16.
Kevin Cassidy: Right. Yes. Just some investors are concerned about you outgrowing your end-markets. But if your end markets are shifting to higher ASP devices, then it justifies why you'd outgrow your end-market.
Stephen Sanghi: Yes. Okay.
Kevin Cassidy: No, just checking to see if you agree with that.
Stephen Sanghi: Yes. I agree with that.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International Group.
Christopher Rolland: So your lead times have increased, but some others, like some European MCU guys, their lead times have expanded well beyond yours. So overall, do you think you guys have net gained or lost share because of competitive lead times in the industry?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, the numbers say we have gained share, and I've given you the numbers. The year-ago in the September quarter, our microcontroller revenue divided by SIA revenue was 14.46%. And in the September quarter that we are announcing today, our share was 15.84%. So that's an increase of 130 bps in 1 year. That's one of the significant increase in market share in 1 year. We used to gain that kind of share years ago. And lately, the gains have been slower. So this was a very significant increase. But I don't think the reason for the share gains is just because the competitive lead times have gone longer than ours. In microcontroller, you cannot gain the share like that. You have to have design done with your product, which is 1.5 years, it takes to put your part in the design. So these were the designs we won 1 year ago, 2 years ago. The lead times of competitors does not have an effect on it. It may have effect onwards because we're winning more designs now, and some of the more designs we're winning today could be because customers are unhappy with their competitors. That will lead to higher share next year and the year after. But the share we gained last year had nothing to do with the lead time.
Christopher Rolland: I see. And then you guys had some interesting commentary, I thought, on the direct energy access provider in Oregon. I'm assuming maybe direct hydroelectric or something. What's the nearly $20 million upfront charge? And then what kind of benefit do we get, maybe gross margin or something like that, going forward from that?
James Bjornholt: So there's a transition fee that you have to pay when you make that change. And that fee essentially covers a 4- or 5-year period. And so from a cash flow perspective, the cash flow savings come at a later date. But the P&L, just with the way the accounting works, the income statement benefit will start getting that impact in our cost here over the next couple of quarters. And then it will get capitalized to inventory, and we'll get the benefit later. So there are incremental savings. That's a good change for us. We think it's going to drive better cost and better cash flow for us in the future. But essentially, it's a transition fee that were being paid, and that's why we have the onetime charge.
Christopher Rolland: And can you quantify at all? Or is it just too small?
James Bjornholt: It's too small in the big-picture overall gross margin.
Ganesh Moorthy: Clearly, it was good enough for us to be able to make a substantial investment, and it accrues for many, many years.
Stephen Sanghi: It will be 1 of our 3 fabs, plus 40% our business comes from foundries. I mean, it's one of the factor in gross margin, along with all the other drivers, which are more analog, higher yields, shrinks, taking Atmel products, bringing them in for assembly and test. And all of these other margin drivers we have talked to you about, this is kind of just one of them, but not really on the top of the list.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Gil Alexandre from Darphil Associates.
Gilbert Alexandre: In the past, you only use to go out to 1 quarter on giving results. And now you talked 7%, 9% gain, which is great. And I'll have to go through what you said in your last commentary. But what do you see? Is it just the addition of products that you sell which is giving your 7% to 9% gain? And how long does it continue like this?
Stephen Sanghi: So Gil, in the last conference call commentary, I had talked about high single-digit. And somewhere along on the investor circle, it got translated into 7% to 9%. But my exact words were high single-digit if you go back and listen to it. And I didn't disagree with that. High single-digit sounds like about 7% to 9% or somewhere there. In this conference call, I broke them into 4 different events, as I said earlier, which was traditional market share gains, TSS attach, distributor partnership approach, and I don't which was the fourth one.
Ganesh Moorthy: ASPs.
Stephen Sanghi: Stable ASPs or increasing ASPs. So when you said in the past, we only did not talk about long-term. We didn't have these 4 differentiated drivers. We didn't have a portfolio rich enough to drive the total system solution. A few years ago, we were not driving ASPs to be as stable or higher. Some of the industry consolidation as well as our own efforts have created the environment where you can keep the ASP stable. So things have changed. Years ago, our competitors were not pulling away from distribution. Today, they are. And we are approaching them, and they're putting more focus on it. So things have happened, which had given us the opportunity. And we're capitalizing on those opportunities so we're able to quantify and guide that we can grow higher. And the last part of your question was, how long does it continue? I don't know. I really don't know.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Congratulations on crossing that $1 billion mark with revenue. First question is actually on some of the proposed tax reform changes in the U.S. I guess, a couple of parts related to that topic. I know it's early, but any sense at this point what it may mean for Microchip's consolidated effective tax rate? And given the proposed rate for repatriating foreign cash, how is Microchip thinking about managing its overseas cash balance?
Stephen Sanghi: I think a general answer on that is that we haven't fully evaluated it. And proposed is just a proposal. A lot of other proposals that have come out on tax rate, health care and other, and not much has happened in Washington. And there's really not much reason to burn calories on it. I don't really know if there is support in Senate with a number of senators against anything that they want to do. So I think it's kind of too early. But if something were to happen, tax law were to change, we'll be upfront in fully understanding it, utilizing our foreign cash and thinking about all the possibilities that exist to take advantage of it and I think may add some more.
James Bjornholt: I think that's exactly right. It's too early. Our tax group and advisors are looking at what's being proposed. So we kind of have to see what actually comes to fruition here, and we'll respond accordingly.
Mark Delaney: That's helpful. And as for follow up on IoT. I know that's been a part of the company's growth strategy in the past. And I realized, Microchip has a more stringent criteria over what counts as IoT versus not IoT. But maybe if you can just level for us at this point how much revenue you think is tied to IoT and what your outlook is for that part of the business.
Ganesh Moorthy: We haven't broken out IoT as a revenue segment. We have done it a couple of times in the past just to provide some more insight at that point. The strategy for the company that we've explained is around providing smart connector and secure solutions. And all of what IoT requires are those 3 big ingredients. And a large chunk of our product line today is feeding the requirements of what would be classified as IoT. So it is a growth driver for us. We see a lot more applications that are building the connected and the secure capabilities. And we have the strong product line to be able to take advantage of that. But unfortunately, I don't have a good way to estimate the IoT-specific revenue.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Eric, just going back to the CapEx. If you look with the raise that you guys announced today, it puts your CapEx to rev over 5% for this fiscal year. It has historically run at sort of 4% to 4.5%. Should we expect CapEx to come back down to that range in fiscal year '19? Or how do we think about the long-term target for CapEx?
James Bjornholt: So you're right. The percentage is higher. And we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have 3 buildings in Chandler, India and Germany that were -- that are kind of, I'll call them, onetime items to help with future lease cost or avoidance of lease cost. So that's one thing. And the other piece is we've got all the Atmel products that were outsourced historically, where we can get very fast return on those investments from a cash flow payback perspective that were -- that it's very much worthwhile from gross margin perspective to make those investments. And those are bit out of the ordinary. So we don't expect, long-term, to be at the 5% rate, but the investments that we're making today definitely are worthwhile and cost-beneficial. So hopefully, that's the color that you're looking for.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.
Craig Ellis: Steve, I wanted to follow-up with the earlier comments regarding some of the company-specific drivers to the high single-digit growth. You mentioned lower ASP declines, distribution, analog attached and traditional share gain. My question is, as we look at those 4 company drivers for Microchip, is the company getting optimal benefit from each of those right now? Or are there things that are more formative or early innings that would give us more benefit next year? And if so, what are they?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. I think he's trying to kind of figure out which are more fully baked in, which ones coming in time. I would say, when you look at TSS, the gains from TSS are going to be accruing as we go into in that coming 1, 2 years of time. Those are typically design-driven. It takes complete design cycle from when we begin to engage, are able to attach and those attached designs to go to production. So I think that's one of the larger ones ahead. Clearly, some of the changes in distribution took place within the last year. That change in engagement, again, takes time. It's new designs that you're affecting, I think. So I think the best of what's to come is ahead of us from some of the changes that Steve described.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.
Rajvindra Gill: Steve, you had mentioned -- or Ganesh, sorry, you mentioned your smart connectivity strategy. And obviously, you talked about attach rates for analog increasing as a drive for overall growth. Can you talk about a little bit -- if you can maybe quantify where we are in terms of the attach rates maybe for the Atmel products? And kind of where do you expect that to go in the future?
Ganesh Moorthy: Qualitatively, it's still low because when we inherited the Atmel product lines and those designs with our customers, they didn't have much microchip attached in them. Now our sales teams and our overall microchip teams have been working on new designs as they come up to be able to showcase the rest of the Microchip product line and to increase that attach. Now we can see the leading indicators in how we see our own design-in activity. Some of the indicators Steve talked about, which is as we measure the rate of attach that's taking place over time. And so in the revenue numbers themselves, they are still yet to come, especially on the Atmel part of the product line. And there may be small things that have taken place. But as time goes on, all these designs, as they go through the 12- to 24-month incubation period, start to go into production, and that's when you begin to see the growth and the revenue that comes from that attach.
Rajvindra Gill: And just a follow-up. So is it fair to assume of that $600 million of Atmel microcontroller revenue that they've generated, that over that design period, whether it's 24 months or more, that a certain percentage of that will start to be attached with the microcontroller core? Can you maybe talk about what the adversive effect on the ASPs would be?
Ganesh Moorthy: So in general, when you look at the dollars per board, we're driving towards increasing the dollar content per board. So attach is taking place, as we mentioned earlier, in 2 ways. And one way, it is where we have the microcontroller. Ours or what came to us through the Atmel acquisition. In that case, the microcontroller is still the microcontroller that Microchip or Atmel had been shipping, but that incremental dollar content of the board. And the other way is where, if we have some of the richer analog product lines, and they don't always come from Atmel, only they come from some of our older acquisitions as well, where we are now providing a higher integration solution, a microcontroller with that analog, perhaps with security, something else onboard. Now those products, the ASP will go up because more often than not, we didn't own the microcontroller portion of that design. We have the analog portion and we are subsuming other people's silicon with our new products. And there, the ASP, we do expect and we do see going up.
Operator: And it appears there are no further questions in the queue at this time. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Chief Executive Officer, Steve Sanghi, for any additional or closing remarks.
Stephen Sanghi: Well, we want to thank everyone for joining the call. I think the next conference we go to is CSFB.
James Bjornholt: Credit Suisse.
Stephen Sanghi: Yes, which is in our backyard here in Scottsdale. So we'd love to see you, all of you, at the conference. Thank you very much.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology first quarter and fiscal year 2018 financial results conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Good afternoon everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2018 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of our acquisition actives and share-based compensation. Net sales in the June quarter were a record $972.1 million, above the high end of our June 5, 2017, upwardly revised guidance and up 7.7% sequentially from net sales of $902.7 million in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted the summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 60.4% in the June quarter and above the high end of our guidance, which was 60%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 22.9% of sales, below the low end of our guidance range of 23%. And non-GAAP operating income was a record 37.5%, well above the high end of the our guidance of 37%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $319.1 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $1.31, which was $0.07 higher than the mid-point of our guidance of $1.24, up 12.9% on a sequential basis and up 56% as compared to the same quarter last year. On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 60.1% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.4 million of share-based compensation and $0.7 million benefit from the recovery of material that was previously written off due to a vendor material issue. Total operating expenses were $362.8 million and include acquisition and tangible amortization of $120.8 million, share-based compensation of $19 million, $2.9 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and special income of $2.8 million, consisting primarily of the gain on the sale of the Micrel San Jose wafer fab in the June quarter. After these adjustments, GAAP net income was a record $170.6 million or $0.70 per diluted share. The non-GAAP tax rate was 8.7% in the June quarter. The GAAP tax rate was negative 2.6% in the quarter. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8.25% and 9.25%. The large difference between our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates relates to the differences in the specific tax rates that apply to the charges that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at June 30, 2017 was $426.8 million. Microchip had 100 days of inventory at June 30, down three days from the end of the March quarter. Inventory days are at a seven year low and we don't expect inventory days to grow in the current quarter as our capacity increases are hardly keeping pace with the increases in demand we are seeing in the business. Inventory at our distributors was at 31 days and that was down two days from the March quarter levels. The cash flow from operating activities was a record at $345 million in the June quarter. As of June 30 the consolidated cash and total investment position was $1.65 billion, of which about $546 million is domestic cash. We continued to make good progress on our leverage with our net debt-to-EBITDA ending the June quarter at 1.58. This is down from 1.94 at the end of the March quarter. Our EBITDA in the June quarter was a record $395.6 million. We expect our net debt-to-EBITDA to be under 1.3 by the end of September. Our net debt-to-EBITDA does not include our 2037 convertible debt as it is excluded from our banking covenants because it is more equity-like in nature due to its 20 year maturity date. Our net debt-to-EBITDA is in excellent condition and declining rapidly, so we're not going to continue to share this metrics in our earnings calls in future periods unless there is a material change. During the June quarter, we received about $40 million of capital at our facilities. Capital spending for the quarter was only $22.1 million due to the timing of the receipt of the equipment and when it was paid for. We expect about $70 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 to be about $180 million. We are aggressively adding capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies and bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margin improvements to our business over time, particularly for the Atmel manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $29 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the businesses in the June quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon everyone. We're very pleased with how all our product lines performed in the June quarter and how the combined assets of Microchip and former Atmel working in harmony continue to produce differential growth results. These are our first results since we unveiled Microchip 2.0 to our investors about two months ago. We look forward to sharing many more updates of our transformation to Microchip 2.0 as we continue to enable our clients with the very best smart, connected and secure embedded applications. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business performed very strongly in the June quarter with revenue being up 9.5% sequentially as compared to the March quarter, setting a new record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, the June quarter microcontroller revenue was up a whopping 18.1%. The June quarter of this year and the year-ago June quarter are completely comparable, as they both represent a full quarter of combined Microchip and Atmel business. We continue to see clients using microcontrollers that originated from Atmel's heritage express confidence in Microchip's stewardship of these product families. As a result, we are seeing more designs that are in the pipeline, going to production and ramping in volume. We're also seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel, which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time. Microcontrollers had over $2.5 billion in annualized revenue, representing 65.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. Additionally, we shipped our 20 billionth cumulative microcontroller in the June quarter. In the June quarter, we also started sampling the PIC32 C product line, our first PIC32 microcontroller, which happened to have an ARM core, so we now have PIC32 microcontrollers with MIPS and ARM cores within them, both of which are supported by the Microchip development tools ecosystem. This is consistent with what we have always said, which is that the core inside the microcontroller is not as important as the brand on the outside, along with the attendant brand promise for what clients expect from PIC microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business gained further market share in the second quarter of calendar 2017, as evidenced by our June quarter results. In fact, the results show that all our microcontroller product lines are firing on all cylinders and driving differential growth and market share gains. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we advance the Microchip 2.0 transformation and build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Moving now to our analog business, our analog product revenue was up 3.7% sequentially in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter and also set a new record in the process. Our analog results were negatively impacted by capacity constraints on products with Atmel heritage, without which the growth would have been higher. On a year-over-year basis, the June quarter analog revenue was up 11.2%, well ahead of the market growth rate for analog. At over $950 million in annualized revenue, our analog products represented 24.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. We are successfully finding more opportunities to attach microcontroller's vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel microcontrollers and microprocessors at multiple customers and applications. This effort should pay dividends over time as these new design wins go to production. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed signal, power, interface, timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our analog products, as we march relentlessly towards making analog a greater than $1 billion annualized revenue business for Microchip sometime in fiscal year 2018 and a much larger business in the coming years. Moving now to our licensing business. Our licensing business was up 8.5% sequentially in the June quarter and set a new record in the process as annualized revenue broke through the $100 million mark for the first time ever. For the last three to four years, we have licensed multiple foundries and independent device markers on multiple process technology nodes and have been working to enable getting these technologies qualified for production. We expect the fruits of this work will soon begin to manifest in our licensing results as the licensed processes start generating royalty revenue for many, many years to come. Moving to our memory business. This business was sequentially up 8.8% in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. We have been very successful in our memory business using the combined product lines of Microchip and Atmel and getting the best from each. There are significant cost reductions underway using Atmel-originated silicon, which will be assembled and tested using Microchip's back-end factories to achieve the lowest overall cost. We believe that this effort will make us even more competitive and improve gross margins further. We continue to run our memory product line in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Finally, before I conclude, a couple of general items. First, in case there are any lingering concerns about the automotive end market in light of the results announced by some of our competitors and the seasonally adjusted annualized rate of automobile shipments, also known as SAAR, which some analysts track, we would like to categorically state that our automotive business performance was strong in the June quarter, with sequential growth pretty close to the Microchip's overall performance. Now this is understandable as Microchip content tends to be in mid to high end cars, which are less sensitive to inventory and consumer cycles, and we continue to benefit from the growth in automobile electronics as well as our market share gains in the automotive market segment. Therefore Microchip's automotive business does not necessarily track with the SAAR numbers, and we expect our automotive business to perform well again in the September quarter. For more information about our automotive business, we refer you to a presentation we made on June 6 at an automotive-focused investor conference, which is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Secondly, on the heels of our ranking in April by Semicast as one of the top 10 largest automotive semiconductor companies, IHS in June ranked Microchip as one of the top 10 largest industrial semiconductor companies and among the top three largest micro-component suppliers to the industrial market. Micro-components in the IHS report refer to microcontrollers and microprocessors. Automotive and industrial are important end markets for our growth and consistent performance, and as we shared with you in May, they together represent about 60% of our revenue. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon everyone. Well, how do you like the results from Microchip 2.0? Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2018. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2018. I will also provide update on capacity enhancement activities, as well as Microchip 2.0 that we introduced to the investors during the last quarter. Our June quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our net sales were a huge new record and well above the high end of our revised guidance. Our non-GAAP net sales for this quarter were up 15.2% from the June quarter of a year ago and this revenue comparison is not impacted by any acquisition since Atmel's full quarter revenue was in the June 2016 quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share each exceeded the high end of our guidance and each crossed significant milestones. Our non-GAAP gross margin crossed the important 60% milestone, non-GAAP operating profit exceeded 37% for the first time and non-GAAP earnings per share crossed an important run rate of well over $5 per share annualized. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 56% from the June quarter of a year ago due to improving sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage and successful execution of our core business as well as accretion from our acquisitions. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip worldwide for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 107th consecutive profitable quarter. There are three other points I would like to make on our sales growth. First, every one of our major product lines, 8-bit MCU, 16-bit MCU, 32-bit MCU, analog, wireless, licensing, memory and others were up significantly in the June 2017 quarter over the year ago quarter. Number two, every major geography, North America, Europe and Asia, were up significantly in the June 2017 quarter over the year-ago quarter. And number three, sales in all end markets were up in the June 2017 quarter over the year-ago quarter. Regarding the reason for the large sequential and year-over-year growth, I will refer you back to Microchip 2.0. We are experiencing an enormous customer preference to design with our microcontroller solutions in all 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit customer applications. This is also demonstrated in the recent EE Times survey. The EE Times survey also indicates that customers believe that Microchip has the best ecosystem in the industry. On the top of that, our various acquisitions have now built a powerful diversified product line through which we are able to provide total system solutions to our customers. Our sales channels have been trained and are welcoming the opportunity to sell multiple products to our customers in the same board. As a result our customers are responding by giving us incremental design wins with multiple products in the same board. We have an enormous design win funnel and we feel very optimistic that in Microchip 2.0 we will continue to see the acceleration in the organic growth of Microchip. Now, before I go into the guidance for our September quarter, I will say that we are continuing to see a very strong business environment for our products worldwide and have a number of company-specific demand drivers. Our bookings rate in the June quarter was extremely strong. Our inventories at Microchip as well as at the distributors are towards the low end of the normal range. Both inventories at Microchip as well as distributors declined further sequentially in the June quarter. While our manufacturing operations produced a lot more units in the June quarter, we shipped them all for growth and did not progress towards improving our inventory position. However, through the growth of capacity and producing a lot more units, our lead times have stabilized. While lead times are still longer than what we would like them to be, they're not getting any longer and we appear to have created a soft landing so far without triggering any double ordering or panic from our customer base. We have increased wafer starts in our three internal fabs and we're adding capacity in our three back-end facilities. We will continue to add additional capacity in all of our fabs, assembly test plants, foundries and sub-contractors. In the back end, there are too many product tester/handler combinations. We are catching up on some of those combinations, as we convert Atmel products to Microchip's more efficient assembly test platforms. However, we don't expect to fully catch up on all product tester/handler combinations until the middle of calendar year 2018. Now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We expect total net sales to be up approximately 3% sequentially, which represents approximately 14.6% on a year-over-year basis. I want to remind investors that in the last five years, we had three acquisitions that closed in the September quarter: SMSC closed in August of fiscal year 2013; ISSC closed in July of fiscal year 2015 and Micrel closed in August of fiscal year 2016. Therefore, mathematically taking the average of the last five years of sequential growth will give you a number of 6.7% and that number would be totally wrong. Excluding these acquisitions, the average sequential growth in the September quarter over the past five years, has been just under 0.5% and ranged between minus 2.6% and plus 6.5%. Our current sequential revenue guidance of 3% growth and year-over-year guidance of 14.6% growth is showing substantial organic growth, consistent with the Microchip 2.0 that we have presented to investors. As a result, in September quarter, we expect to see our first $1 billion quarter. Regarding gross margin, we see a steady improvement in overall gross margin of the company. We expect gross margin for the September quarter to be between 60.5% to 60.75% of sales. We expect overall operating expenses to be between 22.5% and 23% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 37.5% and 38.25% of sales, and we expect earnings per share to be between $1.33 and $1.37 per share. In our last quarter, we revised up our long-term financial model to a long-term non-GAAP gross margin of 62.5%, operating expense of 22.5% and operating profit of 40% and as you have seen, we are relentlessly marching towards this model. This quarter we would like to share with investors our longer-term annual growth expectations of high single digit growth. This higher growth expectation comes from our transformation to Microchip 2.0 and an environment which we expect through industry consolidation will continue to improve from a pricing discipline standpoint. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provides more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: Yes. Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and outlook. Steve, you mentioned pricing discipline as being an important factor. When I look at the two other microcontroller companies that are bigger than Microchip, Renesas, and NXP, do you see this pricing discipline pervasive in the industry? Or I assume you really mostly talk about Microchip, but what about your competitors, do you see this pervasive through the industry?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: The pricing discipline is improving and to a different extent with various manufacturers. I can't mention it, the names of the competitors and specifically what they are doing, but we have seen some discipline on others also, some more than the others. Microchip has kind of led this charge in the last five years, and especially after the acquisition of Atmel, whose pricing was really below acceptable pricing, we have quite substantially corrected those pricing and we have seen others who were relatively undisciplined also make some correct moves in that direction.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I see. And so my follow up, you have mentioned a few times the concept of attaching more analog products. Is there a way to quantify what that attach rate is, how it's trended and whether it's even useful to analyze this trend?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well it's not something we can completely externally share, but we have large number of internal indicators, which are really driven by number of Microchip products per customer board. So if you think about years ago, we just sold microcontrollers and you will usually have one device per customer board. We have well in excess of one device per customer board and the larger and larger that number becomes means you are being able to attach more and more devices, and rather than the attach, we kind of use the word these days, total system solutions. So we track that internally and it's moving in the positive direction. It's not something we plan to share with the Street as just one other thing to track and hit us over the head with.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: We also have some examples in some of the investor conference presentations and again if you go back to Steve's presentation from back in early June, you'll see some examples of what exactly total system solution means.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: And those slides are still on the Internet. You can check it in the investor page.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Vivek.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Congratulations on the record quarter and thanks very much for taking the question. The question was on the lead times. I was wondering if you could give us a bit more quantification of how extended lead times have gotten to and just any sort of differences between different types of products and if you can put into context versus prior cycles.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So our lead times on most products today are between, I would say, 4 weeks and 20 weeks. So lots and lots of products are kind of normal on lead time. It could be version of a given silicon that is longer, but other versions are shorter, so a large bracket around it is about 4 weeks to 20 weeks. But more important part is really, they're not getting any longer. They were getting longer in the prior quarters, as we extended and the normal lead times we will consider where 90% of our products can be bought in 4 to 8 weeks. So that's kind of the bracket and with the capacity growth we have had, we have been able to stabilize the lead time, but as I said in my remarks, we're essentially shipping all the excess production for growth and not able to either lower the amount of delinquent product, or unsupported product, nor are we able to really dramatically shorten the lead times. On some products with tester/handler product combinations have caught up, yes, but in broad majority, lead times are stable but not coming in yet.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And for a follow-up question, somewhat related to that, in your prepared remarkets, Steve, you commented that you think by stabilizing lead times, you think you can engineer a soft landing. You've always been very thoughtful on the cycle and in revenue growth. Any more detail either for the industry or Microchip specifically about what's baked into that assumption about a soft landing and how exactly you go from sort of mid-teens growth to what's assumed in a soft landing scenario? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, I don't have any comments on the industry. I resigned from that job two years ago. We're just simply – I will comment on Microchip. And what I'm seeing is that by lead times really not going longer and taking almost a year to bring these lead times down, that we're guiding to really by the middle of next year, we believe we already have engineered a soft landing and not creating any panic, not having runaway book-to-bill ratio, strong backlog, fair amount of unsupported product. But still largely good behavior on the part of customers and distributors. Inventory is still very low all over the board. Our distributor inventories are low. Our Microchip inventories are lowest in seven years. This is essentially engineering a soft landing.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Steve, I had a couple sort of clarifying questions around your longer-term growth rate of high single digits. Is that your view on an organic basis or will that continue to include sort of the successful M&A strategy you've employed in the past? And if it's more the former than the latter, does that change your view on M&A? In addition, you talked about better pricing. I'd just be kind of curious from where we were to where you think we're going, how much pricing adds to that. And then my last point would just be market share, and I guess around that specifically the time when some of your peers are kind of consolidating their distribution partners and trying to take economics from them, you're taking sort of a more of a Switzerland approach and kind of spreading the wealth a little bit. Do you think that's having a positive effect just through the distribution channel, and that enormous design funnel you were talking about? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Those were a number of questions. Let me see if I can remember all of them.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: First one was organic growth is our, what you talked about -
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So the high single digit kind of growth I talked about is organic. The acquisitions are unpredictable. You do not know when they happen. You cannot schedule them. So that growth rate is organic. Now we believe over the last several years as the industry growth has been fairly slow, with the exception of this current year where the industry growth has been reasonable, there was always unit growth, but the entire unit growth was eaten up by the year-over-year price decreases and pricing pressures and bad practices in our industry constantly to give the price away. As through consolidation and other reasons as large companies have got in pricing discipline, we believe that unit growth is not being eaten up by the price drop. So some of that price discipline is built in into the longer-term organic growth guidance we're giving. And the second part was?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: The second question he asked was does the change in your view on organic growth change the M&A strategy.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Does it change the M&A strategy, it does not change the M&A strategy. If we find a right company that fits well, we can buy it at a reasonable price, is accretive going in and with all the other – check all of the boxes that we have, sort of a pretty proprietary scheme of how we essentially select an acquisition, if we can do that we will do it. However, as you know, the herd is thinning. There are fewer companies left and the valuations are quite high as we speak. But as we're able to find some things on reasonable valuation, it doesn't change our view.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: All right, and John, I think the last piece of your question was market share. I'd like you to repeat that question to make sure we answer it specifically.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah, to the extent – how much of the high single digit long-term growth is expected market share gains and specifically at a time when some of your peers are sort of consolidating their distribution partners and trying to take back some economics from their distribution partners, you seem to be taking more of a Switzerland approach and perhaps spreading the wealth a little bit more. And I'm just kind of curious as to what extent you think that's really helping that design funnel you referenced your prepared comments?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, these distribution things go in cycles. You made a call 10 years ago, we were taking some actions on distribution when we felt that certain distributors were not creating demand, and a decade later now some other people feel the same way. So these things kind of go in cycles. But what we're experiencing is currently, as a number of our competitors have defranchised either distributor completely or they have narrowed their margins and not giving them demand creation margin, we have seen these distributors put a tremendous attention and focus on Microchip and especially with a broadened product line sort of under the Microchip 2.0 initiative that we have, we are finding that distributors are finding the new Microchip 2.0 product portfolio to be so much more desirable and essentially being able to replace the number of other competitive companies where they have lost a franchise on, including microcontroller, analog, wireless, USB, Ethernet, wired products, USB, Ethernet and wireless, just really timing is just perfect for the distribution to grab onto our broad portfolio, and do a great job for us. So I think we are taking advantage of it right now.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And then Steve, if I could sneak one more in, clearly your initial intent around the Atmel acquisition was to buy back stock, and you ended up not doing that. The stock's had a good absolute run since then, but if you kind of look at the relative valuation of Microchip to the S&P, I think by our math this is one of the lowest levels we've seen in almost 15 years. And so can you talk a little bit about the appetite to do some buybacks here, and whether or not, given where you are on your net leverage and your ability to generate cash flow, that that might become a more systematic way of returning cash to shareholders?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, the net leverage isn't a problem now. We're down to 1.58 and we'll be lower again by the end of September. That's not the issue. I think the issue is the majority of the cash is still overseas and we've got about $0.5 billion or so here domestically, and we're still looking for the next acquisition. So it really wouldn't make sense to buy a bunch of stock back and then either have to issue stock in the next acquisition or really then borrow large amounts of money. So I don't think buying back stock really fits right now.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Perfect. Thanks and congratulations again, guys.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the very strong results and outlook. Steve, I know you're out of the sort of broader semi cycle discussion, but as it relates to your business, you've got very good year-over-year growth that you just posted. The guidance suggest it moderates slightly sequentially. Let's say you beat that a little bit; you're still growing very solid double digits year-over-year. What do you anticipate with your new high single digits long-term growth view, how do you anticipate sort of the back part of this cycle to look like? At what pace do you expect that growth that's very strong right now to moderate?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I don't really have a whole lot to say on that in terms of cycle. I think we are seeing a very, very strong demand for our products. I think it's largely driven by a lot of company-specific drivers in analog, in attach, in being able to take Atmel portfolio that was being marketed in a substandard way. Costs were high. Other things were not right and we're correcting a lot of those things and being able to attach analog, wireless and other products to that portfolio. So a lot of it is really company-specific drivers and so I think really this growth momentum continues. We didn't want it to get over frothy and get into double ordering and holding and all that. I believe we're successfully avoiding that by engineering a soft landing. So somewhere over the next year, I think it goes from the current growth rate to the long-term growth rate almost in a soft landing fashion.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: That's helpful. One other question, it's actually a product question. I normally don't spend a lot of time in this area, especially in your press releases, but you highlighted in the first bullet regarding highlights from the quarter a new product with a 2D GPU integrated. I wonder, is that representative of any new trend as it relates to AI inference on the edge, perhaps. Are you seeing more demand for that sort of processing capability and if you could talk about the market for that sort of product, it would be very helpful. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So, I'll have Ganesh comment on that, but let me read the bullet for all the investors. It says Microchip announced the industry's first microcontroller with integrated 2D GPU and integrated DDR2 memory. Our PIC32MZ DA family provides ground-breaking capabilities for an MCU. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So, yeah, this is not really related to artificial intelligence. This is in embedded applications, there is a set of applications where people want the richness of the human interface to include graphics that have more capability. Those have historically been done with separate processors that did the microcontroller or microprocessor and the graphics on a separate chip. We are now putting those together, creating more complete solutions where the microcontroller, the graphics and the DRAM that's required are all on the same chip and in the same package. So, it's an extension of continuing to have high performance microcontrollers, opening up new embedded control spaces.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good evening, guys. I guess the first question just a follow-on on the steps you're taking with regard to the soft landing. And I think we understand what you're saying there. Perhaps you could talk about what's different in the steps that you are taking now, as compared to some prior cycles when your lead times extended. Is it now that you've moved more quickly to expand some capacity and prevent the lead times from getting higher? And maybe if could just expand upon that.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I think the main difference is, your memory is probably of the event two or three years ago. Was it 2014 I think, there was basically a abrupt contraction in the Chinese business at that time, which we mentioned in our call, and that's really what led to a quarterly miss and then cycle unraveling, and it was seen by the entire industry subsequently within three, four months of that, even though a lot of the investors and analysts originally did not see it. We saw it first. I can't predict the world events. There's a war somewhere, something else happens and some sort of event to terminate or to change it. So I think that was the main difference. If your outlook is that some sort of strong event takes place somewhere, then all bets change, that I cannot forecast.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Okay. I don't have a crystal ball for that either. Just with the follow-on, on gross margins, perhaps you could talk about some of the specific benefits over the next few quarters. I know that you're still working to consolidate some of the manufacturing. There's still some steps that will benefit gross margins aside from just better fixed cost absorption.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So, we're ramping all six of our facilities. Three are front end wafer fabs and our three back-end facilities, investing significant capital and those investments increase the utilization in the facilities, make us more cost effective, make the cost per unit go lower. And so, there's a lot of things happening across the board. There's a lot happening in back-end manufacturing which we've talked about more extensively where the lot of the capital dollars are going. And as those come to fruition, the gross margin is going to improve. This last quarter, we continued to see benefits from the Micrel shutdown and most of that is in the model at this point in time, but there's still a little bit of that to go. But the main things are really the capacity improvements pricing as Steve has talked about publically, continues to be a driver of gross margin and we think that's going to continue as better practices happen throughout the industry.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question, and I'll throw my hat in the ring on the congratulations on good execution. And I'll just start on that point and go back to two points that you made, Steve, one the target for high single digit long-term growth and the view that that's attainable, and secondly, that with Microchip 2.0, organic sales should accelerate. You've recently presented I think it's seven points on revenue growth related to Microchip 2.0. So with an eye towards monitoring the leverage that are really going to drive that growth acceleration, what are the things that us investors should be focused on as we monitor Microchip's progress to drive accelerating growth under those seven initiatives?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Are you picking up seven initiatives from our conference call presentation?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: That was from your presentation of Microchip 2.0 I believe. I think you had seven different revenue growth drivers there.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Just pulling it up. I think your question is really sort of how can investors track it. So, a lot of it is related to being able to sell a large number of peripheral products around the main microcontroller, which you sometime call it attach and we're calling it total system solution. We are seeing it in our funnel. We are seeing it in number of design wins of devices per board going up from one, like one would be no attach. So a lot of these things we don't plan to share it externally, I think. So that's part of the challenge. But total system solution we will track it internally. You can track customer preference to design with our MCUs. That analysts and investors can track. There's an EE Times survey which is public. It's on their website. When asked the customers which microcontroller do you expect to use for your next embedded design on 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 8 and 16, we were number one. And 32-bit, if you combine ours and Atmel and two or three different lines, we're number one tied again over there too. So that you can track. We have multiple growth drivers as we quarter-after-quarter talk to you about growth of our microcontroller business, growth of licensing business, growth of analog business. We don't break out our wireless business, wired and wired connectivity. A lot of that is embedded into the analog business. We have tremendous growth going on in our security business as people in IoT are looking for security for transactions, security of being able to connect to the device. We have number of key assets in that area. Automotive business is doing very well in networking, in HMI, in access control, lighting, body electronics. You can see some of that through our press release, continuous flow of press release we are having with most of us and other. So, I think it's complex tracking, but it's all there.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks for the color on that. The follow-up question will be for Eric and it's just related to inventory. So seven year lows on hand. The channel is lean. Is that a level that Microchip can comfortably operate at if we think about the intermediate term or should we expect in what would typically be a seasonally softer period like the fiscal third quarter that the company would look to replenish some inventory whether it's in the channel on hand or both.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So channel inventory, we can't really manage other than the fact of delivering the product that the distributors want. So that's a little bit tougher, but it is on the low end of what we've seen historically. Our own inventory, we've been trying to build inventory on the balance sheet for the last three quarters and just haven't been able to do so with the upsides in demand that we've experienced. So this quarter we expect to not build inventory again. The lead time commentary that Steve talked about getting healthy by the middle of calendar 2018, I think that's probably at the point when inventories might return to a more normalized level. But it's very hard to predict what the demand environment is going to be.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So you talked about a seasonally softer December quarter in which we could build some inventory. I think what's more likely is that we are able to catch up on some of the delinquencies and unsupported product leading to better than seasonal December, but not building inventories, because you can't build inventory before you have given the product to the customer to meet their demand. So it's more likely that we will reduce the unsupported amount of product than building inventory. So that's what it looks like right now.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Okay. So from what you can see now, the demand from your customers, as well as the timing with which new capacity is coming online, both front end and back end, would lead you to believe that it's likely that there'll be some demand catch-up and you could have an above seasonal December quarter, Steve?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Not really numerically guiding it, but directionally I expect it better than seasonal December.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for the help. Good luck.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations on the solid execution and outlook. On the strong quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year performance in MCUs, I'm just wondering if the Atmel products grew faster than the overall MCU segment. Just post closure, you had higher confidence levels by Atmel's customers. You've got their refreshed 8-bit AVR product line and other enhancements. It's only been more than a year post Atmel. You guys are probably still seeing some of that momentum. Just wondering if this is driving some enhanced growth in the product line.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So we're not commenting on any breakout of growth on Atmel products versus our growth. In some cases, a product can even be substituted and like we said from the very beginning, we manage it as one company and give the customer the best solution, where we have product available or can meet its needs, in some cases, switch from one to other. If the product is not available in one category, make it available in the other category. So I think individually commenting on where the growth is coming from is really not meaningful at this point in time.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Then on the transformation to Microchip 2.0 and then the results of the EE Times survey, I mean the team has already had a strong systems focus in place for a long period of time. I think you guys have something like over 2,500 reference platforms, development boards, sample projects, et cetera. So you guys already had a pretty strong program in place to help customers with their design solutions and drive attach rates. So how does Microchip 2.0 build upon this to further drive the attach rates of analog, connectivity, networking, memory and interface products?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So that's a good question, and let me take a shot at answering it. So Microchip 2.0 is not an event where I flipped a switch today. Microchip 2.0 has been in formation for about five years, and which you yourself said in when we acquired SMSC, we got USB technology, we got Ethernet technology, we got audio technology. When we bought Micrel, we got a number of great analog assets. When we bought Atmel, we got some Wi-Fi assets, we got some security assets and Atmel's large microcontroller portfolio. As you go to the customers, there was largely one product per board. Atmel sold the microcontroller. There was no Microchip analog or anything else present around it, because we were the enemies, so it will be anybody else's product but Microchip's. And in the last year, on all the internal reference designs, development tools, sales brochures, and sales training and all that, it's now full with Microchip's analog and power management and Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, USB, timing products and all that kinds of stuff. So, this has been a thing in building and we are really just packaging it for you now and saying we are seeing it working, and it took some time to train the apps engineers and sales force and get the distribution aligned with what some other companies have done with their distribution also gave us an opportunity. So it's really culmination of all these initiatives coming together, where we can tie a board on and say, hey this looks like a new company to our distributors today and to our salespeople and others and saying I can sell a very broad portfolio today. Take any one company out of it, Atmel, it substantially reduces it. Take Micrel out, reduces it further. Take SMSC out, it reduces it further. So it's a build-up on all these companies. I don't know if that helps you.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. That does. Thanks for the insight, Steve.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Welcome.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Chris Danely with Citigroup.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Steve, I'll ask you to refrain from any industry predictions, but it sounds like the improvement in Microchip is mostly Microchip specific. So, between what you're seeing and what your distis are seeing, how do you think like the overall semi business, sort of the overall semi industry, did during the June quarter? Do you think it just kind of held serve, or do you think there was some improvement sort of industry-wide that happened during the quarter?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, I was hoping that SIA announce their June numbers. Usually they always announced it on July 31. This one time I needed it and they did not, and I was going to use that to comment on it. I think they're going to announce later this week, and that would be a read on the industry. l don't really have any comment on the industry.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then one quick clarification. So on the lead times stretching out, when do you think you could take them back to normal? Do you think it's like a year from now or maybe six months from now, or when do you think we can get back to normal?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So I earlier said, the lead times are right now between four weeks and 20 weeks and are stable, not going longer. The normal we consider between 90% of our products to be within four to eight weeks, and we believe it's going to take us at least till June next year to get there.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks for the clarification.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Hello, Gil.
Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates: Congratulations, again.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you.
Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates: On your normal inventory levels, you used to have 130 days or 120 days. Do you use these numbers now, or you've changed?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So the normal inventory for us would be 115 to 120 days. We may have in the past also said 115 to 125 days when we felt we needed a larger band. We haven't changed the targets. We just cannot seem to get there with the strength of the demand. I mean the growth we had last quarter of 7.7%, for the last several years that was a two years of growth, that we did it in one quarter. So we're basically, it's taking everything we got in growing the capacity, building more units, and then shipping it out the door for revenue. And the inventories are very low. Our inventory is seven-year low right now, and we don't see short term being able to build it.
Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates: All right. Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Hello.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Steve, as you're adding new capacity, do you have an idea of what revenue level can the capacity you've added drive?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, our capacity is being added in small chunks all over the place. You add a furnace here, a handler here, a tester here, a prober here to resolve specific product constraints on specific package types and specific product lines. It's not like we build another $1 billion fab and it takes you from here to there. So the new equipment is arriving every week to two weeks, so it's really more incrementally, serially being added rather than in very, very large chunks to get to some new number. I don't know whether that makes -
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So this is, yeah, this is a better controlled and avoiding a risk of your customers, I guess, putting in orders that -
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah, there is no capacity, there's no risk here of all this capacity then somehow sits idle. Because as soon as the next tester and handler arrives, there's a rush to put it on the floor, qualify it, characterize it and put it in production. Every diffusion tube, every handler, every (58:36) everything is very quickly going to incrementally produce the product, and help to either, three things, help to either reduce the unsupported product, delinquent product to the customer, that's the first priority. Number two, to then really build a little bit of the inventory so that the lead times will come down. We can never get to the second, because largely, and number three to ship for growth. So shipping for growth is number one, the reducing delinquency is number two and building inventory is number three. We're only able to do number one right now, ship for growth.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Hello, Raj.
Operator: Caller, please check your mute function. And with no response, we'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. Just wanted to dig in a little bit more to Microchip 2.0 and, Steve, as you said, it's kind of been a formation over five years. But just anything you're doing from a sales organization, from a distribution, whether it's incentivizing them or education to kind of really see the full benefits of 2.0?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So, I happen to have our VP of Sales and Applications, Mitchell Little in the room and I'll give him the unique opportunity to answer that question.
Mitchell R. Little - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you, sir. Our compensation system, first of all, we have to recognize our compensation system has never changed. We are the only non-commission sales team in our industry. So we've not changed any of that, we've done basically the same things. We've engaged with our distribution partnerships in just that mode, engaging with them to help them do more of what they're doing. So we've not shifted anything other than shifting our thinking about total system solutions a little more broadly. We're pretty much what we've always been and been successful at.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, Steve any commentary, and I know one of the focuses has been kind of Atmel attach and you touched on that in terms of the opportunities. But any other color you can add in terms of the design kind of funnel and what are you seeing on that front?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well like I said, the design win funnel is very, very large. It's almost scary. You never know from a large design-in funnel what is a yield out of that, because customers can always tell you this design is 10 million units, and it turns into a lower amount. We have metrics on that from years of experience what size of the funnel can yield to what kind of growth, so what is the yield out of the funnel. But with the Microchip 2.0, as some of the input variables are changing, a lot of attach, a lot of ancillary designs around our micro, the whole integration of Atmel, attaching our products to Atmel's microcontroller, I think the yield out of that funnel is a bit less predictable. If the yield is the same as it was before, it's scaringly large, but it's possible that it is a little bit new and therefore the yield could be slightly different. But it's enough good to be very optimistic about what I'm telling you and it's based on data and information. It's not a pipe dream.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. Thanks.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Chris Rolland with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey guys. Nice performance on the quarter and also great performance for MCU. Steve, I think you mentioned all those different MCU categories that were up year-on-year. Perhaps you can highlight maybe a few that had upside surprises for you or perhaps some that had faster growth than others.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Ganesh, do you have anything to comment on that?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: No, we don't break out the growth rate of specific microcontroller segments. It works as a collective portfolio. It's very, very strong with a combined portfolio of classic Microchip and Atmel combined. And I think it's winning designs because we've infused energy into the Atmel designs and our historical products have always had strong momentum behind them. But outside of that, we don't have any additional color.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Switching gears then. Steve, looking back on publishing that letter to customers in April, what were the effects that you saw immediately after you published that? Did you guys actually see a marked surge or kind of uptick in orders immediately or would you say that it was kind of just select customers coming in and a smaller percentage of customers that put fresh orders in? How would you describe kind of order trends immediately after publish of that? Was it a big deal or not?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So, it was not a big deal. We published the letter on April 4. For some strange reason, investors didn't catch on to it for two weeks. We thought you guys get that in a nanosecond. But we published the letter on the web on April 4. So, I commented on that in our May press release, in the May conference call. We basically did not see any impact. The bookings were extremely strong in the March quarter and after publishing the letter the bookings did not really get any stronger. The activity that usually takes place is, all of our worldwide sales force takes the letter to our customers and to our distributors and distributors start working with customers to understand their longer-term needs and saying lead times are going longer, so don't only tell me what you need it for this quarter, also tell me what you need for next quarter. Start looking at major products and new designs that may have a substantial ramp coming up, and that information then through distributors and our own people, customer by customer start flowing in into building a demand forecast, and is a more accurate reflection of what we should be building and what we should be planning. And what it results is, and some of it comes into backlog and what it results into is, it increases our ability to build the product in a better mix. Remember, a large amount of product that we start wafers on, we start wafers on and forecast not always having a backlog today. We start on a forecast and by the time the wafers go through fab, assembly, test, then the backlog will come in on that product to ship it. So, any time you start on a forecast like that, you always have a level of out-of-mix situation where we built a little too much of this, a little too little of that, and the little too much then ships in the following quarter. But it results into some lost sales, because you didn't have the right product. The effect of the letter is really giving us a broader understanding of customers' needs in more exact mix, resulting into an outstanding execution in the correct mix. And its results you saw in the quarter with a very strong growth and continuing strong growth in the coming quarters.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great. Those are great details. Thank you very much.
Operator: And it appears there are no further questions in the queue at this time. And Mr. Sanghi, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, we want to thank all the investors and analysts for attending the call and we'll see some of you during the quarter as we get back out on the investor circuit or conferences in September. So, thank you very much.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Please stand by, we're about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip Technology Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC, that identify important Risk Factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2017 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website, at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of share-based compensation and our acquisition activity. Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record $902.7 million, near the high end of our guidance and up 2.4% sequentially from net sales of $881.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 59.24% for the March quarter and significantly above the mid-point of our guidance, which was 58.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 23.66% of sales, significantly below the mid-point of our guidance range of 24.5%. And non-GAAP operating income was an outstanding 35.6%, well above the mid-point of our guidance of 33.7%, and very close to reaching our prior long-term operating model goal of 36%, which we had just established this past quarter. Non-GAAP net income was a record $276.9 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $1.16, which was $0.10 higher than the mid-point of our guidance of $1.06, up 12.6% on a sequential basis and up 64.7% as compared to the same quarter last year. For fiscal 2017, on a non-GAAP basis net sales were a record $3.502 billion and up 58.2% year-over-year. Gross margins were 57.6%, operating expenses were 25.9% of sales and operating income was 31.6% of sales. Net income was $937.1 million and non-GAAP EPS was a record $3.99 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, net sales in the March 2017 quarter were $902.7 million, GAAP gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 59% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.2 million of share-based compensation and a benefit of $1.4 million from a settlement with a vendor associated with a fab excursion in a previous year. Total operating expenses were $378.7 million and include acquisition and tangible amortization of $94.3 million, share-based compensation of $18.8 million, $6 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and special charges of $46.1 million, consisting primarily of charges associated with our acquisition integration activities, including a $33 million charge associated with the lease facility in San Jose which we inherited in the Atmel acquisition. We have vacated the San Jose lease building and are finding the environment for subleasing the facility to be quite challenging. With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition-related charges and the related tax impacts, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $136.9 million or $0.57 per diluted share. For fiscal year 2017, GAAP net sales were a record $3.408 billion, gross margins were 51.6%, operating expenses were 43.5% of sales and operating income was 8.1% of sales. Net income from continuing operations was $170.6 million or $0.73 per diluted share. The non-GAAP tax rate was 8.4% in the March quarter and 8.5% for fiscal year 2017. The GAAP tax rate was negative 91% in the March quarter and negative 90% for fiscal year 2017. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% and 9%. And the large difference between our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates relates to the differences and the specific tax rates that apply to the charges that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at March 31, 2017 was $417.2 million. Microchip had 103 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, down one day from that of the end of the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors was at 33 days and up two days from the December quarter. The cash flow from operating activities was a record $322.6 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $1.41 billion, of which about $500 million is domestic cash. Due to our February 2017 refinancing activities, we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit at the end of March. As part of the refinancing activities, we exchanged some of the 2.125% 2037 bonds issued in 2007 for newly issued 2.25% 2037 bonds. There is still $143.75 million of the 2.125% bonds outstanding, for which there is a call date in December 2017. Our current intention is to call any of these bonds that remain outstanding at the call date, and we have classified these bonds as short term on our balance sheet. We continue to make good progress on our leverage, with our net debt to EBITDA ending the March quarter at 1.94; this is down from 2.47 at the end of the December quarter. I remind you that last year when we announced the acquisition of Atmel, we had projected our net debt to EBITDA to be about 3 at the end of the March 2017 quarter, wo we have made tremendous improvements in our business over the past year to get where we are today. We expect our net debt to EBITDA to be about 1.65 by the end of June. Our net debt to EBITDA does not include our 2037 convertible debt, as it is excluded from our banking covenants because it is more equity-like in nature due to its 20-year maturity date. Capital spending was approximately $23 million in the March quarter. For fiscal year 2017, capital expenditures were $75.3 million, and well below our last communicated guidance of $90 million. We expect about $60 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 to be about $170 million. The capital expenditures in the June quarter are high due to rollover of some capital from fiscal 2017 that wasn't received until after year end, due to equipment lead time stretching out. We are aggressively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margins improvements to the business, particularly for the Atmel manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factory. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $32.6 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased with how our strategic product lines performed in the March quarter and how the combined assets of Microchip and former Atmel working in harmony continue produce differential growth results. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller products performed strongly in the March quarter, with revenue being up 4.4% sequentially as compared to the December quarter, setting a new record in the process. We continue to experience broad-based growth in our business, as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller product lines met or exceeded our expectations for the March quarter. Microcontrollers at over $2.3 billion in annualized revenue represented 64.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our overall 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller portfolio in the broad-based market. Clients using microcontrollers that originated from Atmel heritage continue to gain confidence in Microchip's commitment to these products. As a result, we are seeing more designs that were in the pipeline which are going into production and ramping in volume, as well as continued growth in our design-in funnel, which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time. Last month, Gartner Dataquest released their microcontroller market share report for calendar 2016. We are pleased to report that Microchip retained the number-one position for 8-bit microcontrollers and once again gained market share in calendar 2016. In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we continue to gain market share as we were the fastest-growing franchise among the top players and we remained in the number-five position. In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we gained significant market share again and climbed from the eleventh to the sixth position. For microcontrollers overall, we climbed from the fourth position to the third position and continued our relentless march towards the number-one spot. As the Gartner results demonstrate, we gained significant market share in calendar 2016 and we continue to gain market share in the first quarter of calendar 2017, as evidenced by our March quarter result. And I believe we have the product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Now moving to our analog products. Our analog product revenue was up 1% sequentially in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter and also set a new record in the process. At close to $925 million in annualized revenue, our analog products represented 25.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We are successfully finding more opportunities to attach Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel microcontrollers and microprocessors at multiple customers and applications. This effort should pay dividends over time as these new design wins go to production. We, in the meanwhile, continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed signal, power, interface, timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our analog products as we march relentlessly here, too, towards making analog a $1 billion revenue business for Microchip. Moving to memory products. Our memory product revenue was sequentially down 2.3% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter. We continue to run our memory product line in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. One last note as we consider our calendar year 2016 performance. Last month Semicast ranked Microchip as the eight-largest automotive semiconductor company, a significant move up from the mid-teens ranking we were at in 2015. Automotive and industrial are important end markets for our growth and consistent performance. And as you will hear in Steve's remarks, these end markets have grown as a share of our overall revenue. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017 and total fiscal year 2017. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2018. Our March quarter financial results were very strong. Our non-GAAP net sales were a record and near the high end of our revised guidance. Our non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share each exceeded well beyond the high end of our guidance. In non-GAAP earnings per share, we blew the top off, with a record earnings per share and up $0.10 above the mid-point of our guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 64.7% from the March quarter of a year ago, due to improving sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage and successful execution of our core business, as well as accretion from our acquisitions. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip, including acquired employees from various acquisitions worldwide, for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 106th consecutive profitable quarter. As I reflect on fiscal year 2017, we had outstanding financial results in every quarter. And closing out the fiscal year with record sales and earnings per share was a befitting tribute to the fiscal year in which we repeatedly hit the ball out of the ballpark. Now let me decipher the financial results of Microchip from the fiscal fourth quarter. We achieved a new all-time high gross margin and operating margin percentage in our core Microchip business, excluding Atmel, substantially exceeding any prior records. On Atmel, the gross margin improved by another 235 basis points sequentially and Atmel's operating margin achieved another all-time record, exceeding 30% for the very first time. We achieved an accretion from Atmel in the March quarter of $0.25 per share versus our guidance of $0.18 to $0.22 per share. The total accretion from Atmel for fiscal year 2017 was $0.69; this was compared to $0.25 accretion as our first estimate after we announced the acquisition and without any stock buyback. By any measure, our March quarter and fiscal year 2017 results are stellar. We're also proud to have achieved 35.6% operating margin for the combined company, which is a stone's throw away from our long-term operating margin target of 36% that we just revised upward last quarter. I want to again thank the worldwide employees of Microchip, including acquired employees of all of our acquisitions, for delivering a stellar and record fiscal year 2017. Now, investors and analysts have frequently asked us about our revenue breakdown by end market. We have not broken those numbers out in more than a decade, as we do not manage our business by end market. Our standard products sell in multiple vertical markets and have a broad appeal across these various markets. We occasionally see end market breakdown mentioned in some analyst reports. Our end market breakdown, though, has changed substantially in the last decade from our various acquisitions, as well as organic growth in several markets, especially industrial and automotive. Therefore, we have done a comprehensive analysis to prepare and update the end market revenue breakdown of our business for our investors and analysts. Based on fiscal year 2017 results, our largest market is industrial, with 35% of our business in this market. The second-largest market is automotive, with 25% of our business. Then comes consumer, with 24% of our business, computing with 9%, communication with 5% and, finally defense and aerospace, with 2% of our business. Over the last several years, our fastest-growing markets have been industrial and automotive, which together account for 60% of our business now. Additionally, our consumer exposure of 24% is not made up of mobile phone; it is made up of home appliances, security systems, thermostats, televisions, remote controls, power tools, drones, joysticks, headphones, furniture, consumer toys, et cetera. With a broad product line and large customer base, compiling our end market breakdown is quite time consuming. We are providing the color for investors to better understand the current complexion of our business by end markets. We do expect to provide this breakdown regularly, but will do so when there is a meaningful change to share. Now, before I go into the guidance for June quarter, let me say a few words about the environment. We are seeing a very strong business environment for our products worldwide. Our bookings rate is extremely strong. As you know, we have not broken out our book-to-bill ratio in a long time, since it is largely misunderstood. However, to make you aware of the strength of our bookings, we are providing this indicator for one time. Our book-to-bill ratio for the March quarter was approximately 1.10. Again, I caution you that bookings are aged out, so a 1.1 book-to-bill ratio does not mean 10% sequential revenue growth. We also take revenue based on sales out from distributors and book-to-bill ratio only measures bookings for sales into distributors. Therefore, the book-to-bill ratio does not represent or help you predict the growth in this quarter, but does give you a sense for the strength of the business environment for our products that we're managing through. Other inventories at Microchip as well as at our distributors are towards the low-end of the normal range, therefore we are starting to see some lengthening of our lead times. We're starting to see challenges in fab, foundry, probe, assembly and test capacity. We have increased wafer starts in our three internal fabs and we're adding capacity in our three back-end facilities. Despite all this, we are seeing significant business that we're not able to support by the customer requested dates. These challenges are more acute with our Atmel-originated products, due to the inadequate capacity plan that we inherited. We are adding capacity to alleviate these challenges as quickly as practical. We also posted a letter on our website on April 4, 2017 informing our customers regarding many of these points. Some of you have questioned our motives posting these letters in the past, suggesting that somehow we were trying to pull ahead backlog. Our bookings were very strong before we posted the letter, and the rate of bookings has not changed after we posted the letter. We believe that our 115,000-plus customers has the right to know about the challenges we face in the current business environment and to prepare for it accordingly. Posting it on the web is the best way to disseminate this information. Now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We expect total net sales to be up between 2% and 7% sequentially. I want to remind investors that in the past five years, we had two acquisitions that closed in the first week of April. Supertex closed on April 1, 2014 and Atmel closed on April 4, 2016. Therefore, mathematically taking average of last five years of sequential growth for the June quarter would give you a large error. Without acquisitions, our average of last five years of sequential growth in the fiscal first quarter was 3%. Therefore, our revenue guidance is substantially above seasonal. We're also not seeing any issues with our automotive business as some others in the industry have commented. We believe that the comments about subsidies in China on electric cars and other automotive comments were more company-specific. Our automotive business has very strong backlog and continues to grow well. Regarding gross margin, as more and more savings from our fab consolidation and cost improvement efforts show up and Atmel gross margins continue to improve due to pricing as well as cost reductions, we see a steady improvement in overall gross margin of the company. We expect gross margin for the June quarter to be between 59.5% and 60% of sales, we expect overall operating expenses to be between 23% and 23.5% of sales and we expect operating profit percentage to be between 36% and 37% of sales and we expect earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27 per share. I would like to remind investors that last quarter we conservatively revised our long-term financial model upwards to a long-term non-GAAP gross margin of 60%, operating expense of 24% and operating profit of 36%. We are now already guiding the June quarter to be at or above this long-term operating profit target, therefore we are revising our long-term operating margin target upwards again. First, let me give you some background. We are seeing an enormous gross margin operating expense and operating profit leverage in our business. We are ramping all of our three fabrication facilities. The increasing utilization lowers the wafer cost. We're also ramping all three of our back-end plants. Atmel's test technology was about a decade behind that of Microchip's in terms of higher amount of parallel testing to achieve higher units per day out of a test system. In many cases, Microchip's units per day per system is 5x to 10x higher than that of Atmel. We are converting many of Atmel's high-volume products to Microchip's test technology that is substantially lowering the cost and improving the output. This continues for the next two years or so. The combined effect of lower wafer cost, more efficient assembly and test technology and stable to increasing prices is that we expect our long-term business model to exceed any prior expectations. Therefore, we are setting our new long-term gross margin target to be 62.5% of sales, we are setting our new long-term operating expense target to be 22.5% of sales and we are setting our new long-term operating profit target to be 40% of sales. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to First Call. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: In order to accommodate as many callers as we can, we ask that you ask one question and one follow-up, you may then reenter the queue and we'll take as many questions as time permits. We'll take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the questions and congratulations on the strong results. I guess, Steve, can you help me understand a little bit relative to you increasing CapEx, increasing wafer starts, when do you think you'll be able to catch up with the demand curve here in the near term? And I guess you said in the press release that there's a considerable amount of demand that you can't meet right now. Any way that you can help us quantify what you're leaving on the table in the near term?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So in terms of CapEx, the majority of CapEx that we're adding is in the back end. As I mentioned, Atmel's test technology was about a decade behind. And we're converting many of Atmel's high-volume products to Microchip's assembly test technology. The challenge with that is that the easiest way to add quickly incremental capacity is to buy up more of what they have, more of what we have in Atmel, same test systems, same capacity. But that is very, very inefficient. And if we buy more of that, we get stuck with it for five to seven years in a high-cost structure. So we're trying to buy more efficient capacity, Microchip type, which then requires the writing the test programs, converting them to Microchip's test technology, correlating and doing all that, which takes a little longer. So it's a very fine juggling exercise to reasonably able to satisfy the customers and not have lines down and yet keep a steady march towards converting those products to a very low-cost technology, which is giving gross margin improvements and all that. So driven by all that, there is significant constraint. We are unable to dollarize the constraint for you today because it changes every day. We don't know where we will end up at the end of the quarter. We know the number where we ended up last quarter, but I think we're less comfortable in sharing it. I did want to say one other thing, John. After our last earnings call, I saw in your report where you said we see Microchip entering uncharted levels of operational efficiencies and leverage, which should support long-term operating margin of 40%. You were right on.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I get lucky every once in a while.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: You're were, well, either good or lucky. Probably good. It seems that you were right on. You saw something that we saw too, but we were not ready to commit yet and not ready to guide to a 40% operating margin target yet. And we are now and we have guided as such.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Well, see, maybe that's good lead into my second question. Clearly the scale you've amassed is giving you leverage on the operating line. I'm curious as to what benefits you might be able to see on the top line from your scale, just given that the markets you've played in have been pretty diverse. I guess are we seeing a trend where customers want to deal with fewer suppliers who can do more, and do you think that that's a long-term sort of advantage for you to perhaps gain share at a faster clip than you historically have?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So I think I would say, in our commentary, we have been very careful to not describe the market environment to be anything other than for our products. If you re-listen to what I said, I used it twice, the market environment for our products. We didn't really make any commentary on general market environment. You could talk to everybody else. That's kind of your job to figure out the general market environment. We described it for our products. So baked in in that environment is also tremendous leverage that we are getting attaching the vast portfolio of our analog products, memory products, to Wi-Fi products, to Bluetooth and others, along with various microcontroller and other products we have. Now, we have sort of 19 different product lines within Microchip today and we're getting enormous leverage in what you call attach in the past, and we have given it a new term at Microchip; we call it Total System Solutions. So, if you look at the number of devices per board that we had, let's say, five years ago, it's dramatically increasing in terms of number of devices we have per customer board today. I can't give you the number. But that is accelerating and, therefore, somewhat we're creating our own environment. There is a tremendous organic growth we have seen in our business in the last year. And if you just recall a year ago, there were organic growth concerns. And at the same time, we have added some acquisitions. So if you just look at the March quarter, we beat the earnings by $0.10. $0.05 came from higher Atmel accretion and other $0.05 came from core Microchip. So it's not one or the other. We are really just accelerating on both fronts.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Perfect. Thanks, guys. And congratulations.
Operator: We'll go next to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Steve, with John's successful run at 40 percentile, I'll promise not to raise the bar to 45% op margins. But if we can talk about just that attach rate as a follow-up, particularly for wireless connectivity, what you're seeing for MCU with wireless attach and the momentum in that market.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: We have many, many embedded systems adding connectivity to them. Certainly, wireless is a big component of that, but we also have wired connectivity in many systems. And our portfolio of connectivity is extremely rich at this point between successive acquisitions that have added to our portfolio. So embedded systems in general are becoming more valuable when they're attached. We're finding lots of opportunities for Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRa, a number of other proprietary standards, to help these systems connect to whatever is appropriate in their environment. And it is a part of the growth that we're experiencing.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then as my follow-up, can you talk about 32-bit, and I know you guys have the MIPS as well as the Atmel ARM core and I know there is more focus on the peripherals than the core. But just wanted to get a sense now that you're a year into Atmel, just some of the design win and product momentum that you're seeing in the marketplace for 32-bit ARM?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So we don't think of it as 32-bit ARM alone. We look at overall 32-bit business. The 32-bit product line has been growing faster than Microchip average growth that we've had. We have fully incorporated the products that came to us from Atmel, what we call the SAM products, and the products historical for Microchip, the PIC32, into our integrated roadmaps as we present it out into our customer base when we pursue new designs. And they're doing very well. And we see strengths in the portfolio that we inherited from Atmel that have taken us to new areas, not only in microcontrollers. We've also got microprocessors that were part of the portfolio. And then we have some strengths from classic microchip that continue on their efforts. And the forward-going portfolio has a single roadmap. We've brought that all together. And we're very, very confident in the 32-bit product line and its growth under the Microchip cloud (35:30).
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Ganesh.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong results and thanks very much for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about capital allocation going forward, especially now that you've done better than you had anticipated on the leverage levels coming down. How should we think about the company's interest in engaging an additional M&A? And what are your thoughts around doing share repurchases?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So, I think it's quite simple. There are three uses of capital. There can be three different uses: using it in our own business in making investments, giving it as a dividend or using it as M&A, and you can call it maybe, fourth, stock buyback. We're getting extreme leverage on the operating expense side in our business. And it does not seem like we will have a need to go outside of our P&L model to make really a lot of OpEx or any kind of investments. In terms of CapEx, even the number we guided for the year is really a small portion of the overall yearly revenue, even though the Q1 is high, a little bit front-end loaded, largely because of slip of capital from last quarter. In terms of dividend, our dividend strategy does not change. The board is committed to continue with the dividend we have and a very, very small minuscule increase every quarter. There is no desire to really do anything different. And as far as stock buyback is concerned, we do not regularly buy back stock. We've only bought it at extreme occasions. Last time we bought stock was when we had to issue some stock in the Micrel acquisition and we wanted it to be a cash transaction, so we bought the stock back. So that really leaves M&A. Atmel acquisition now was about a year ago. It's largely consolidated. But as I mentioned, a lot of the back-end and other challenges still remain. We're still trying to convert their test technology, assembly technology, to ours, which will take some time. So if a reasonable acquisition falls in our plate, we're willing to execute it. But the valuations are fairly high right now and there is really nothing imminent that we have on our plate.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. And then for a follow-up question I was just hoping you could help us understand what steps we should think about in terms of bridging from the company's margin levels today toward the targets. You talk a lot about the changes to Atmel's back-end operations and some potential additional leverage as you go forward. Are those the two things that get the company to its target margin ranges? Or are there other things that we should have in mind that the company would execute on to get to those levels?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, it's a little broader than that. We are seeing tremendous gains in reduction in wafer process essentially (38:51), both by increasing loadings in all of our three fabs as well as being able to cross-pollinate and use ours as well as Atmel technology for each of those products, whichever the best solution may be. They were good in certain things; we were good in certain things. Certain products will be cheaper here; certain products will be cheaper there. So we're getting a significant leverage out of fabs. And then, as you mentioned, we're getting significant leverage out of assembly and test technology. And overall we're getting a lot of operating expense leverage, a lot of other manufacturing leverage also out of the same footprint in our facilities and all that just pumping a tremendous amount of output. Recall that Atmel did no assembly themselves; they were zero percent assembly and they only did 10% of the tests themselves. Microchip, on the other hand, did nearly 90% of our tests ourselves and we did about 70% of our assembly ourselves. So two companies combined together now, both assembly and test percentages done in-house have dramatically gone down because of Atmel. And as we bring those things from subcontractors to inside and in the process also increase the utilization and increase the output by 5x to 10x per system per day, the results are tremendous. They're just beyond what we could have expected and beyond the leverage that we could reasonably describe. And I must say that this detail level of due diligence was not available to us. Very poor due diligence was shared. It's because we were ahead on competitors and all that. So a lot of this area we have really done it on our own clock, identify the areas where we could bring significant cost reduction. And we are basically in the process of implementing the first high-volume products on microcontrollers and memories and a few other products are already flowing out of our manufacturing facility. So this is not a pipe dream. We have delivered the front-end of that already.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I would add pricing discipline as the other element that we're proud of (41:20) over the last year to help improve the overall gross margins.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Maybe one other thing to add is that there's still benefits from the shutdown of the Micrel fab that aren't seeing recognized in the P&L we've today. So still a lot of things we're working on together. The things that Steve is talking about Atmel, that's a couple year project. So we've got a lot of headroom and things to work on over the coming quarters.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Chris Danely with Citi.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, guys. First question is just on the lead time extensions. I know you have several different products with several different lead times. But if you could, is there any way to quantify the amount of the lead time extensions? And then, Steve, when was the last time you saw this type of lead time extensions? And then do you think you'll be able to catch up the demand over the summer. Or do you think they can get worse?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: It's not getting worse. Unlike what some of the people on the Street think, the letter has not accelerated the bookings in any way. It didn't accelerate the bookings last time. It didn't accelerate the bookings this time. The letter was posted on April 4, and we received these tremendous bookings in the March quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.1. And it did not change afterward. Our customers are fairly trained on they expect that – we written this letter about 10 times probably in the last 20 years or so. It's results were less than optimal one time a couple of years ago, which, soon after that, the China market fell apart. And, as a result, we had a miss. And many times, the Street just remembers what happened last time. So these letters have been very effective in informing our large 115,000-plus customers regarding what is happening and then working with them to understand the requirements, being able to build the product in a better mix to understand people's drop-dead requirements so people don't go lines down. So I can't give you one number across the range of our products, 100,000-plus SKUs. People kind of like to look at one number what the lead time is, and there's no such number. On a given product, lead time could be eight weeks today, and you get one large order and the lead time goes to 12 weeks because the parts which were after the eight weeks are now booked. On the other hand, there are plenty of products available on the shelf. So the lead time can be anywhere from in-stock to 16 weeks, I would say. All over the place.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: And we're working hard to try to get the delinquencies all down by the September quarter timeframe. It all depends on what happens in terms of the bookings on a continuing basis. But that's what all the firepower in the company is aimed towards.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. You mean, Steve, just going to sit in the office and call 115,000 customers and tell them that the lead times are extending?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: That's what the letter's for.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So my next question is just some clarifications on the margins. In terms of the new targets, is that like half from Atmel and half from the legacy Microchip? And then just in terms of the all this accretion and upside you've seen on Atmel's operating margins, can you break out how much is COGS versus your operating expenditures?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, Atmel's both gross and operating margins still remain well behind Microchip's. And as I mentioned, Atmel's operating margin, we got it over 30% and gross margin was up another 235 points. Despite those numbers, they're still substantially behind Microchip's. And we've always said, based on the large amount of mix they've taken before, we never expect that to make 40% operating margin, which really means core goes above and Atmel is below and we bracket an average to about 40%. So the improvement will really come from both. As we are ramping our fabs, it's lowering wafer cost and helping both gross margin. As we are bringing Atmel's assembly test technology to Microchip's level, the help of that transition to our technology is helping Atmel gross margin, but it's bringing much more output into our factories from outside, which then is also increasing core gross margins.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Spreading the overhead over a larger base.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Spreading the overhead over a larger base, allowing us to buy more volume of lead frames to packages to molding compounds to everything else in a larger supply with better economics and all that.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We'll go next to William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. And I'll add my congrats as well. I'd like to ask about the characterization of this cycle, Steve, as you've done in the past. Clearly, we're heading into a time of a bit of tightness, a bit of this imbalance between supply and demand. How much of what you're seeing is more related to lack of capacity in the Atmel product versus accelerating demand? And do you anticipate we'll continue to see improving year-over-year growth beyond the June timeframe, which is I think the sort of consensus view at least among sell-side analysts?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Again, I will refrain from making any general remarks about the industry and largely focusing on how I see the business environment for our products. A significant impact of what we are seeing is really driven by the success of our own products in the market and the total (47:51) that I earlier talked about. Number one, there was a significant reluctance on the part of the customers during the year that Atmel was up for sale, regarding what would happen to those products, what would be supported and would not be supported. And if you, as a customer, have a concern, then you kind of always have a back-up plan in case those products were not to be available. When it became clear that Microchip would buy Atmel, customers were more even disheartened originally thinking that Microchip being a staunch competitor may discontinue AVR and ARM-based products and others. What we did was just the opposite. And as Ganesh mentioned in his commentary, the result of all that has been a tremendous amount of customer confidence that we have gained in our strategy, in what we are doing. And we're getting unfair share of the design wins and customers' ear. and then analog and Wi-Fi and memory and other attach to boot. So a large portion is really driven by that. There are always small numbers that can really drive a significant change. Beyond that, we're also seeing general strength in the economy, especially happened post-election in U.S. The whole world seems to be positive. You can talk to distributors and they are seeing strong bookings and a strong environment. Lead time for equipment is lengthening, lead time for packages, all sorts of things is lengthening. So those are some of the signs of what's happening generally in the economy. But I think what we are seeing has really also a significant company-specific element on the top of that.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for that. And one follow-up, if I can. Eric, I think more your area of expertise. I think there is a FASB pronouncement that's going to require you to transition to a sell-in rev rec. Can you confirm that that's correct and, if so, the timing and anticipated impact on your reported financials?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah, so that change will be effective for Microchip April 1, 2018, so the beginning of our next fiscal year. We are going through the planning process associated with that. I guess what should be important from an investor standpoint is we are not going to change in any way our go-to-market strategy with our distributors, the way that we price our products, the way that we interact with them. But the reporting will have to be on a sell-in basis, where essentially you're making an estimation of what the net sales price of the product that you're shipping in is going to be. So our accounting team is working through that and will be effective for us next year.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. And congrats again.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Congratulations on the solid results execution and the outlook. As we think about growth and as it relates to Atmel's design win pipeline, I know you guys recently refreshed Atmel's AVR 8-bit product line. I think you guys even embedded some of your own IP into this particular product line. I know you guys do a good job of keeping track of design win rates. So, wondering if you've seen a step-up in design wins or feedback from customers for the new AVR 8-bit products?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: It just depends on what timeframe you compare against. So, we have been at it for a year since we bought the company. And the funnel size is enormous. We're seeing substantial growth and the total funnel size on Microchip across 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, Wi-Fi, our networking business, our automotive business, infotainment, MOST business, that the funnel size across Microchip is just enormous. I think we are incredibly and beautifully set up to really deliver what we are telling you.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for the insights there. And then, on the analog side, you guys are basically within striking distance of $1 billion in annualized sales. I think last I asked this question, about 50% of these products are tied to your MCU programs and the other 50% is sold kind of standalone on their own performance merits. Is that still the right mix? Or are you getting more attraction on a standalone basis? And then maybe any updates on your analog attach rates to Atmel's MCUs.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, we don't really look at the analog business to be either attaching to our microcontrollers or standalone. We want to succeed in both. If we had a very high attach rate but never won anything standalone, that, to us, would be negative because that really means we can only win when it's our microcontroller. That's not the case. Even if we don't win the microcontroller, and it's a microcontroller from Freescale, Renesas, NXP, or anybody, or maybe the socket doesn't have a microcontroller, it is driven off a microprocessor or a FPGA or some sort of SoC, we still want to be able to win analog in those sockets, rather it's a – for power management or convertors or have some Wi-Fi on it or have some supervisory op amps or some other things. So right now I think as we look across, we have victory in every area. We are winning around our microcontroller, we're winning around Atmel's microcontroller and we're winning around other people's microcontrollers, SoC, FPGA, processors, et cetera, and there is no specific focus to be one way or the other. We actually have identified a built-in large opportunity to attach analog around Atmel's microcontrollers because those were the sockets we were purposely kept out. Any of the reference designs that Atmel produced before, by design they would put anybody else in it but Microchip. In the last one year, all those reference designs, tools, development tools, et cetera, they've all been refurbished to replace anybody's analog and Wi-Fi with Microchip's. So there you have incremental additive analog that we should be able to attach. And we are.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for the insight, Steve.
Operator: For our next question, we'll go to Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.
Robert Mertens - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Robert Mertens on behalf of Rajvindra. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. You broke out the revenue breakdown by end market. You had about 25% in the automotive end market and you mentioned that this was around the eighth largest semi supplier. Do you have any visibility towards what areas of automotive you're seeing your products go into, if there's strength in infotainment versus ADAS or power management? Or any granularity there would be great. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: We are in a broad range of applications, but we have some specific ones we have a larger exposure to – so you mentioned infotainment. But I'd broaden that to networking inside the car as one area. We are in many access control applications in the car. We are in touch control for a range of both touch screen and touch buttons and things. We're in many USB connectivity inside the car. We're in all the garage door openers inside the car. So it's a pretty broad set of applications and with some specific areas in which we have a much higher penetration than even normal.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I think we have 51 chips in a Mercedes S-Class car, 55 in a Hyundai Genesis. It's everywhere, up and down the car. So, it's much more broader than anybody can describe.
Robert Mertens - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. And then in terms of I guess products going from the high end S-class to Hyundai Genesis and going more mid-market, are you seeing that be a trend that's taking off now or still a quarter or so out?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, those trends don't happen in a quarter. If you look at the keyless entry, where you don't need the mechanical key anymore, began nearly 20 years ago from General Motor (sic) [General Motors] cars. I think we put the first keyless entry where you don't have to use a mechanical key to open the car. We did the first hotel room door lock years ago. Before that, there used to be mechanical keys that even opened the hotel room door lock. And as you have seen over the years, people don't even know there's a mechanical key exists for hotel rooms or cars and stuff like that. So these changes are a lot slower, happen over time. These are not one quarter phenomena. There are 400 different car models that have the HomeLink on it, all-exclusive product of Microchip. There are many hundreds of models that have our MOST bus. There are a large number of models that have our touch in it, and so on and so forth. They all start at the high level and, every year in the following model year, the company will take it down to the middle-range models. And a few years from now, it could get to the lower-end models. Feature-by-feature they migrate down, but the trend doesn't change as much quarter-to-quarter.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I think the way to think about it is we have a high presence in all car segments; it's not just at the high end that we are present. That was just an example to show you in a rich environment of electronics, we have a pretty high percentage. But if you look at the lower-end cars, we have just as high a percentage in many of those cars.
Robert Mertens - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go now to Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Liz Pate - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hi, guys. This is Liz Pate in for Chris Rolland. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just a quick one on the pricing environment. Maybe you can talk about how that is currently industry-wide, and specifically on the Atmel products. Do you still have some ability to raise prices on those products? And thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So we've been talking about it for multiple quarters. It's taken us time to implement the price changes across a broad range of customers. Some of them have been phased-in over time so that they don't all come together in one quarter. But I would say, at this point in time, a substantial portion of the price increases that we've began last June or so are in place. And as we go in – going forward, it's really no programmed increases in prices. What we have done is also put in a significant discipline on new designs, because what we were doing with the price increases was correcting past issues where pricing was done poorly. And those new designs are all being done using a more disciplined process to make sure that we don't have to come back and change the pricing out in time. But pricing for our market tends to be something that it happens at the point of a design-in, and so that's when the competition for what the best performance price-value equation is. And then that happens a year or two before designs usually go into production and there isn't as much pricing discussion that takes place once the designs have been completed and production is getting started.
Liz Pate - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I want to add, though, that to extend what Ganesh said, that as all the new quotes we are making, really in the last year, have all substantially better disciplined pricing than the average pricing we are having on Atmel parts today, as these designs are going to production, it has been about a year now. So designs are starting to go to production on those things that we quoted on our clock. There will be a steady stream of wind on the back where every quarter the mix gets richer and richer with higher and higher percentage of pricing to be better disciplined pricing coming from Microchip and smaller and smaller percentage of older devices on which we raised the price, but we couldn't raise it all the way to where the new prices are. So this would be a long-term tailwind that will continue to blow in the back.
Liz Pate - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Perfect. Thanks. And congrats on the quarter.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: We'll go now to Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on your execution. The first question is a gross margin question maybe most appropriate for Eric. I believe the company was expecting to see the benefit of the Micrel San Jose fab shutdown in the first part of the calendar quarter. Is that in fact happening? And, if so, is it more in the calendar first quarter, calendar second quarter or more evenly distributed?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So I would say the benefits from the Micrel shutdown have been coming over time. We still probably have a couple of quarters to go as we sell through all the older inventory and all the 8-inch inventory starts to be realized in the cost of sales. So we have got benefits from that the last two quarters, but expect that to continue on in the June and September quarters also.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Eric. And then the follow-up question is for Steve. And, Steve, it goes back to a comment that I think you made a few calls ago, when you indicated that, if industry were to grow, I think the number was high-single digits or 10%, I don't recall specifically, that that would favor vertically integrated manufacturers. So my question is this. With demand strong, with the global economy showing signs of improvement and with what appears to have been a five-year period of fairly disappointing analog CapEx, are you seeing signs in your business where the environment is favoring a vertically integrated manufacturer, like Microchip? And, if not, do you think that will occur later this year, or is that something that would be further into the future? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, I think it is happening already. You are seeing it on our results and you will see it in our results in the coming quarters also. If Atmel was a standalone company today, they wouldn't be able to take advantage of these tremendous improvements we're making on assembly test technology inside capacity being able to bring large volumes on our test technology already running in our Thailand facility producing 5x higher output per system. Subcontractors have no incentive to give you that kind of output. They get paid by the hour on the test system. So if you dramatically improve output and output goes up 5x and now you only have to pay them for 20% of the hours, they're not happy. So there the incentives are not aligned properly. You're seeing tremendous benefit of our vertical manufacturing, both from fab, probe, assembly and tests already and you will continue to see it as we go forward.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today's question and answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back to Mr. Steve Sanghi for any final remarks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, thank you, everybody. We are pleased to deliver an outstanding quarter and an outstanding fiscal year. And watch us grow, hopefully we can deliver another one. And we'll see some of you at the conferences we will go to later this quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip Technology Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2017 financial performance and Steve, Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page on our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the December quarter were a record $881.2 million and they were well above the high end of our guidance and were up 0.8% sequentially from net sales of $873.8 million in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.8% in the December quarter and significantly above the midpoint of our guidance, which was 56.9%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 25% of sales significantly below the midpoint of our guidance range of 26.7%. And non-GAAP operating income was an outstanding 32.8% well above the midpoint of our guidance of 30.15% and very close to reaching our prior long-term operating model goal of 33%, which we had previously guided investors that we would achieve in the March 2018 quarter. Non-GAAP net income was a record $246.5 million resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $1.05, which was $0.145 higher than the midpoint of our guidance of $0.905, up 11.6% on a sequential basis and up 64.9% as compared to the same quarter last year. On a GAAP basis net sales were $834.4 million, GAAP net sales were $46.8 million lower than non-GAAP net sales because for GAAP accounting purposes we began recognizing revenue on a sell-through basis for the Atmel Asia distributors. On October 1, 2016, an inventory sitting in the distribution channel on that date was not recognized as revenue in our GAAP financial statement when it was subsequently sold by the distributors. Sales to all Atmel distributors are now being recognized based on sell-through revenue recognition. GAAP gross margins including share based compensation and acquisition related expenses were 55.8% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.5 million of share based compensation, $26 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustment I mentioned earlier, $12 million in acquired inventory valuation costs and $3 million of manufacturing shutdown costs associated with the Micrel fab. Total operating expenses were $347.2 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $82.8 million, share based compensation of $18.7 million, $4.2 million of acquisition related and other costs, and special charges of $20.9 million consisting primarily of charges associated with our acquisition and integration activities. With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition related charges and the related tax impact, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $107.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share. In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 8.3% and the GAAP tax rate was negative 28.5%. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% and 9%. The large difference between our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rate relates to the differences in the specific tax rates that apply to the charges that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balances at December 31, 2016 was $419.6 million. Microchip had 104 days of inventory at December 31, 2016, up 1 day from the end of the September quarter. Inventory at our distributors was at 31 days and at the same level as the September quarter. The cash generation in the December quarter excluding our acquisition and divestiture activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was a record $258.8 million. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $699.7 million. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at December 31 were $1.683 billion, up $5 million from the prior quarter levels. Excluding dividend payment, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $230 million to $250 million in the March quarter. We continue to make good progress on our leverage with our net debt to EBITDA ending the December quarter at 2.47. This is down from 2.91 at the end of September quarter. We expect our net debt to EBITDA to be under 2.1 by the end of the fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2017 and that's well below the last forecast that we provided to investors of 2.35. Capital spending was approximately $15.7 million in the December quarter. We expect about $38 million in capital spending in the March quarter. And overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $90 million compared to our previously communicated FY 2017 forecast of $110 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities, for our fast growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Deprecation expense in the December quarter was $29.7 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you Eric and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased with how each of our product lines performed in the December quarter and how the combined assets of Microchip and former Atmel working in harmony are producing differential growth results. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines. Starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business in the December quarter held up well in a seasonally slower quarter and was up 0.3% sequentially as compared to the September quarter, setting a new record in the process. We continue to experience broad based growth in our business as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses met or exceeded our expectations for the December quarter. Customers using microcontrollers originating from Atmel continue to gain confidence in microchips commitment to those products and began to see how powerful the combined microcontroller roadmaps going forward are. As a result, we are seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel and expect this to drive future growth as these designs progress in to production over time. We have also seen many examples, of how the joint sales and business unit teams are able to find and win more opportunities using our broader basket of analog connectivity security and memory products to garner a larger share of the available content in an application. This in turn we expect will help drive incremental growth over time. In all our product lines. Microcontrollers at over $2.2 billion in annualized revenue, represents 63.1% of microchips overall revenue in the December quarter. We remain pleased with the performance on the competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market, which have been augmented by the addition of Atmel’s portfolio. We continue to gain market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Our Analog business was up 1.4% sequentially in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter and also set a new record in what is normally a seasonally weak quarter. At well over $900 million in annualized revenue our analog business represented 25.9% of Microchips overall revenue in the December quarter. As I mentioned earlier we are successfully finding more opportunities to attach Microchips vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel microcontrollers at multiple customers and application. This effort will pay dividends over time as new design wins go to production. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear mixed signal, power interface timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our Analog business, as we march relentlessly towards making Analog a greater than $1 billion revenue business for Microchip. Moving to our memory products, our memory business was about flat in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. During the quarter we introduced a new memory solution called an EERAM, which offers unlimited endurance and safe data storage should a power loss occur. That is ideal for a broad range of applications. This gives us one more opportunity to add to the content we can win in our customers applications, as we deliver total system solutions to them. A quick summary of where we are with the Atmel integration. We had already made significant progress for the business unit integration by the end of the September quarter and completed this activity in the December quarter. Our sales integration continued to progress well, with extensive cross training of our direct sales teams as well as our channel partners sales teams. The sales integration is now largely complete, with pricing changes we have discussed before continue to roll out during the quarter and we will have further changes that take place in the March and June quarters. On January 1, 2017, we went live with Atmel’s business systems transitioning to Microchips business systems. This was a significantly complex activity to plan and execute, the transition is going as planned but the small number of normal issues that are being rapidly resolved. And where we are at this point of the transition to our systems is about where we have been at the same point with prior acquisitions, which is quite positive given the size and complexity of the Atmel business and business systems. The integration work to take advantage of our internal manufacturing capability to lower the cost of packaging and testing products that are currently outsourced has just started and will continue for many quarters to come. All in all the third quarter of integrating Atmel has progressed on or ahead of our plan. Our profuse thanks go out to our many employees across the globe, who have gone above and beyond that contribute to the rapid integration. Their tireless efforts on multiple fronts helped deliver synergy results that are well ahead of forecast. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward and more about the tremendous results from the Atmel integration.
Steve Sanghi: Thank Ganesh and good afternoon everyone. Today I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2017. And then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration of Atmel. Our December quarter financial results were extremely strong. I would say that we hit the ball out of the ballpark. Our non-GAAP net sales, gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share all exceeded the high-end of our updated guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share, was an all time record and was $0.145 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance. And up 64.9% from the December quarter of a year ago due to improving sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage, and successful execution of our core business as well as accretion from our acquisitions. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip including acquired employees from Micrel, Atmel and other acquisitions worldwide for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 105th consecutive profitable quarter. As I reflect on the calendar year 2016, we had outstanding financial results in every quarter in closing out the calendar year with explosive earnings was a befitting tribute to the year. In the last quarter's conference call, we shared with you our 200-day assessment of what we have done to correct Atmel's weaknesses. Today I will provide a 300-day update on where we are in correcting these weaknesses, and this will probably be the last update on that topic. First, lack of pricing discipline. Average Atmel prices continue to go up and we are seeing it in the improving gross margin. Atmel gross margin improved another 50 basis points sequentially. We mentioned in the last conference call that on the distribution front we caught a lucky break as one of our largest competitors has changed their distribution program where they will be using distribution only for fulfillment and terminating the registration program under which the distribution earned higher margins for demand creation. This is continued to have a very positive effect on Microchip as the distribution sees a very strong portfolio from the combined Microchip and Atmel franchises and it increasing their commitment for demand creation for Microchip. We now have a long list of customer designs sockets where the distribution has converted the design from this large competitor to Microchip. Number two, high operating expense culture. Atmel had a culture of high operating expenses which routinely ran over 40% of sales. We have now corrected Atmel’s operating expenses, as well as a culture related to operating expenses. Number three, swinging for home runs and getting large customers at low margins, this has now been corrected as we are aligning Atmel sales focus to be consistent with that of Microchip. Number four, accountability, Atmel had a culture of poor accountability with a broad-based implementation of Microchip type of bonus plans, which are based on overall company growth and profitability. We are rapidly changing that culture. In our presentations, communications and classes at Atmel, we are teaching that at Microchip management is accountable. As of now, approximately 90% of the employees of Atmel are only common bonus program with Microchip employees. Number five, poor team work. Atmel did not have a culture of team work, bonus and equity grants were very large at the top at Atmel and less than 30% of the employees had bonus and equity. At Microchip 100% of our non-Atmel employees are on a bonus program and nearly 100% of our non-Thailand production labor employees are on equity program. With Microchip managers teaching them role modeling of our culture and with 90% of Atmel employees on common bonus program with Microchip employees we are now all pulling the ship together and in the same direction. And number six, Atmel made no investment in training and development of employees. In a short 10 months nearly 100% of Atmel employees have gone through at least some training class at Microchip. We are continuing to put Atmel sales and field applications engineers through a two-week extensive training that we call boot camp in which we train the employees on Microchip's client engagement process, our values, culture, and align them with our goals and reward system. Rapid changes are taking place and employees are bonding to the superior system at Microchip and the results are improving rapidly. So with that, now let me continue with deciphering the financial results of Microchip from the fiscal third quarter. While we will refrain from providing line by line breakdown of our results between core Microchip and Atmel, we will provide some useful nuggets of information on Atmel as well as Microchip to ahead of those nuggets. We achieved an all-time high operating margin percentage in our core Microchip business. On Atmel, the gross margin improved by another 50 basis points sequentially. Regarding Atmel's operating expenses I mentioned earlier that Atmel's operating expenses are now in range of the Microchip model and has been corrected. With the combined effect of better than expected net sales, higher gross margin percentage and lower OpEx, the Atmel business achieved operating margins of over 26% of net sales. Which is the highest operating profit percentage ever achieved in Atmel’s history. We achieved an accretion from Atmel of $0.21 per share versus our guidance of $0.13 to $0.17 per share. Now despite the significant initial skepticism from investors and analysts about our ability to realize synergies, we had forecasted from Atmel, we were always confident in our assessment of synergies and our results have shown that we were actually extremely conservative in our initial projection. By any measure our December quarter results are stellar. We are also proud to have crawled back up to 32.8% operating profit percentage for the combined company and within a smidgen of our long-term model of 33% operating profit, which we initially guided to be three to four years away at the time of Atmel acquisition announcement. I want to again thank the worldwide employees of Microchip, including acquired employees of all of our acquisitions for delivering a stellar and a record calendar year 2016. Before we go into March 2017 quarter guidance, I want to bring up one point. Our integration of business systems for Atmel was originally scheduled for November 1, 2016. However, due to extreme complexity of business systems in our largest acquisition ever we had to push out the go live of our business systems integration to January 1, 2017, a two months delay. As a result, several of our customers requested early shipment of their product that was originally requested to be delivered in the early part of January. We believe the impact from these customer requests added approximately 1% to our December quarter revenue. Ordinarily we attempt to schedule these business system integrations in the middle of the quarter to minimize impact on our quarterly revenue results. As a result, investors should view the true end market demand for our products in the fiscal third quarter to be about 1% lower than our reported GAAP and non-GAAP net sales. And our fiscal fourth quarter 2017, true end market demand to be about 2% higher than the midpoint of our GAAP and non-GAAP net sales guidance. So now let's go into the non-GAAP guidance for the March quarter. We expect total net sales to be between minus 1% to plus 3% sequentially. Again, without the customer requested early shipments in December quarter. The guidance for net sales would have been plus 1% to plus 5% sequentially. But we will report and compare net sales against our true non-GAAP guidance of minus 1% to 3% sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 58% and 58.5% of sales. We expect overall operating expenses to be between 24% and 25% of sales and we expect operating profit percentage to be between 33% and 34.4% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $1.01 and $1.11 per share with a midpoint of $1.06. The earnings per share guidance include an accretion from at Atmel of between $0.18 and $0.22 per share. Now last quarter, we increased the accretion target from Atmel from $0.40 to $0.50 for fiscal year 2017. With $0.44 of accretion already achieved in three quarters, the $0.50 target is a gimme. With this quarter's midpoint guidance we are revising the fiscal year 2017 accretion targets from $0.50 to $0.64 per share. In the last quarter, we also increased our accretion targets for fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019. Those increased targets were $0.70 for fiscal year 2018 and $0.90 for 2019. All these targets are without stock buyback. We’re again revising the accretion targets upwards for fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019. We are revising fiscal year 2018 accretion target from $0.70 to $0.90 and we are revising accretion target for fiscal year 2019 from $0.90 to $1. I remained you that the businesses of Microchip and Atmel are now completely intertwined after January 1, 2017 and increasingly difficult to break down. Last quarter we told you that we will achieve our long-term financial model by the end of fiscal year 2018 versus three to four years that was embedded in our forecast when we announced the Atmel deal. With the success we have seen so far with Atmel and Microchip and with great results from the core Microchip business as well as Atmel, we just about achieved our long-term model on the operating margin of 33% last quarter, it’s fully ahead of our last update. We also expect to achieve our 59% gross margin model in the next six months as some of the benefits of Micrel fab shutdown are ahead and we have barely begun on moving some of the Atmel’s products to Microchip’s assembly and test technology and we are already ahead of our operating expensive model Therefore today we are revising our long-term financial model up upwards. We're setting up a new long-term financial model that new long-term non-GAAP financial model is 60% gross margin, 24% operating expense and 36% operating profit. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory writer up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analyst continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call. With this, operator, will you please pull for questions?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach: Yes, thank you. Steve, even if you exclude the 1% contribution from Atmel like a pulled forward, December quarter was a bit above seasonal. So can you talk about the environment you're seeing out there, how much of it is, just some slight improvement versus Microchip specific?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think we have been kind of telling you all along that we see the environment to be pretty good and many of the concerns that Street has shown on the environment or in China in the past a year or so, we have been continuously arguing that we were not seeing those, our results were very good, they were good by month and for the whole quarter. So, true, if you take that 1% away our result would still have been about to flat to the September quarter and we have never had a flat December quarter. It’s always down two percentage points.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. And then as my follow-up, any thoughts on the dividend in terms of just potential growth there and I asked that just because free cash flow is starting to inflect higher. Certainly on the other hand you guys have been very effective at M&A and creating value that way. So just how you think about kind of dry part of M&A versus some potential for increase dividend growth.
Steve Sanghi: Well. We're basically using all of our free cash flow created in U.S. for paying the dividend. I mean we're really breaking even on the U.S. cash flow, sometimes you have to borrow little bit from the credit line and all the excess cash generation is all overseas. So there's really no change in the dividend strategy. We'll continue to do what we're doing increase it by just by a smidgen every quarter and majority of the cash will continue to really grow overseas. And none of this has any kind of repatriation dialed in. We don't know what that rule would be and what the new administration will or will not be able to do.
Craig Hettenbach: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on a strong results. Just going back to the updated accretion numbers for Atmel. I just want to make sure that I'm clear. Is that just assuming incremental sort of cost synergies and your ability to do things like have better price discipline at Atmel and doesn't include any potential revenue synergies. And if that's the case, can you kind of give us the 300-day update on kind of what sort of revenue synergies we should expect over time between sort of core Atmel and core Microchip.
Steve Sanghi: So it basically includes all of that, includes a cost reduction, it includes the gross margin improvement, it includes a reduction in the product cost using some of Microchip's technologies and others. And it includes revenue energy. Basically if we didn't have Atmel, what the result would have been and what are the results total, the difference is the accretion. So it's all included.
John Pitzer: I guess that’s all. And then little bit more detail maybe from Ganesh on kind of the internal manufacturing capability that you're building up this year on the CapEx. I guess help me understand at the end of sort of this CapEx then what percent of your test and packaging will you be doing in-house versus sort of external and I guess what's the financial implication as you bring more in-house.
Ganesh Moorthy: We have a multi-quarter plan that looks at different package combinations being brought in for assembly and test. If you go back and look at the last several acquisitions that we've done, they all had a little to know internal capability. And so the percentage of assembly we were doing in-house has come down and the percentage of test we've done in-house has come down. Now we will only bring things back in-house when we find that the cost improvement is significant and the payback in any CapEx we have is within our guideline. And we have plenty of opportunity within that – within those guidelines. And so we are systematically going ahead with CapEx increases. Specifically to build up our assembly capacity in-house as well as the test capability in-house. We have some more advanced test technology that we have deployed on many of our Microchip products that we can bring to bear on the Atmel and micro product lines as well. And so it will be a sustained investment over many many quarters as we bring more in-house capability for assembly and test and bring the cost down in every one of those cases within the return on investment guidelines we have for any CapEx investment.
John Pitzer: And Ganesh, those efforts already fully reflected in your long-term operating margin targets.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. There's a big chunk of it which will be – there will be additional improvement that we will make over time. But by and large it's hard to separate out a single element of just assembly or test, overall improvement so we're trying to make that are reflected in the long-term goals.
John Pitzer: Perfect, thanks, guys. congratulations.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Congratulations on the good results and thanks very much for taking the question. The questions on the manufacturing side and just where your lead times are with the strength that you're seeing in the cycle on some of the changes you're making to your operational footprint are any of your lead times for products starting to extend.
Steve Sanghi: Our lead times at all generally normal, there is always pockets here and there, but there's no significant lead time changes.
Mark Delaney: Got it, that’s helpful. And then just in terms of at the timeline to get to the new target model of 50% gross margin. When you get Atmel fully integrated to that, get you to that 60% gross margin or the other things that need to occur if you to close the remainder of that gap.
Ganesh Moorthy: We usually do not provide the revenue level or the timeline at which we achieve that model. It's a long-term model usually it's a little bit out. And you saw in the last couple of times we achieved that rapidly while initial guidance was three or four years away, but we don't clearly provide a granularity on that.
Steve Sanghi: Right, we don't, maybe to what I'll add to that is, we said on this call that in six months will be at 59% or above gross margin. So that leaves us 1 percentage point away from the gross margin side and the midpoint of our guidance, for operating expenses this quarter is 24.5%. So we're going to make pretty rapid improvement to get there, but we don't want to tie it to a specific date or revenue target.
Mark Delaney: Understood. Thanks very much.
Operator: We'll continue onto Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon and congratulations on this solid quarterly performance and outlook. On the analog side, you guys are within striking distance of billion dollars in annualized sales. I think Steve you've shown previously, your MCUs and attach rate to Supertex's products for example post that acquisition. I'm wondering if you have any attach rate metrics you can share with us is relates to Microchips analog attach rates to Atmel's MCUs.
Steve Sanghi: We probably have some data on it. It’s early not enough time has lapsed. But nothing that I can give it to you verbally on this call, we’ll see if you can include slide and so in some future conference presentation.
Harlan Sur: Okay, great. And then given the business system switch over that happened earlier in January, it looks like that got executed or is getting executed pretty well here. Are there any OpEx synergies realized post that move and I believe also that there’s a potential for some site consolidation here in Silicon Valley as well, has a decision been made to implement that and if so kind of timing and impact to the cost structure.
Steve Sanghi: So, there are cost synergies posts to go live. So essentially – starting this quarter essentially, most of the Atmel and CPU System goes into the read-only mode only, if not being used. So lot of the costs related to come out – related to that come out – some of them do not come out for the entire quarter, because till we close the quarter announced earning filed a Q and all that we have to keep accessing it. Some of the costs go out for about half of the quarter. Some of the costs go out for about all the quarter. And then the next quarter, they will be even for a longer time. So that’s the first part of your question. The second part of your question is regarding the site consolidation. So we are getting out of the Atmel building, it’s extremely expensive 8 story building right near the airport. Great views and all that, but just extremely unaffordable and expensive compared to any of the microchip properties anywhere in the world. And we’re consolidating all of the remaining Atmel employees into two other campuses we have in San Jose. One is the Micrel campus and other one is a campus where all of our other acquisitions are, SST, SMSC, OG and roving networks and all the other acquisitions, which is on Holger 3 [ph] in San Jose if you’re familiar with it. About half of Atmel employees have already moved to our campuses and the remaining have will move pretty much by the end of February or early March. That building total had I think a $10 million cost per year. And what portion of it is already behind.
Eric Bjornholt: About half of it. because half of the floor is already…
Steve Sanghi: So half of it is already behind and in our Q3 numbers. The other half will be no longer in our numbers probably three quarter for this quarter and 100% for the following quarter.
Harlan Sur: Right. And just to – I could just squeeze one more in for Eric. At your long-term financial targets of 33%, I can see your runway for free cash flow margins to approach kind of 20% to 30%. Is that kind f the way I would think about it?
Eric Bjornholt: Yes, so that’s not a metric that that we have provided to the street, but you’re definitely the ballpark there. I mean if you look at the free cash generation last quarter just taking the operating income less the CapEx that those levels.
Harlan Sur: Great thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll go to Craig Ellis with B. Riley Financial.
Craig Ellis: Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the execution guys. Steve, I wanted to start off just by getting your feedback on what appears to be when I listen to the prepared comments and some of the Q&A an unusually large number of company specific growth drivers for this year. It seems like the list would include better Atmel customer reception for products based on improvements you’ve made to that business. The competitors distribution actions, which have facilitated company specific share gain for microchip. The pricing action that was taken on Atmel’s portfolio last year, which would have meaningful year-on-year benefits, and then your ability to attach your analog products to Atmel’s microcontrollers and drive growth from that initiative. So, is that there and as you look at the business – are there anything – is there anything that you see that would be a material driver to company specific growth beyond that list.
Steve Sanghi: And I think you got most of them. I think we are gaining share in our microcontroller, analog, Wi-Fi, licensing business and other businesses are improving their gross margin, cutting the OpEx, gaining the synergies having a good attach success with all sorts of analog, Wi-Fi products and on the microcontroller and vice versa. I think you’ve got most of them.
Craig Ellis: Okay. And then looking at looking at the Company’s intermediate term evolution, you’ve made no secret in the past that you want to continue to execute an organic and inorganic growth strategy. But, as you look at the financial readiness you’re certainly getting to that coverage earlier than expected three months ago operational readiness working through the systems integration. Where are we in your mind with respect to being ready to look for incremental opportunities for inorganic growth?
Steve Sanghi: So we have been extremely inward focused lately to make sure all this integration goes flawlessly and while we’re doing all that and basically running two companies. The Microchip core performance is not slip and you have seen that that we have performed miraculously in both end. So there is currently not a company in our funnel, I mean, we have to after we complete the Atmel integration and we have to restart the work of really reenergizing the funnel and look at what is available and start to date and try to find something. So right now we can’t give you any update on next M&A.
Craig Ellis: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Chris Danely with Citigroup.
Chris Danely: Thank guys, great job. Hey, just a question on market share out there. Now that Freescale is being taken over by MXP and Renaissance is undergoing a big restructuring in Japan. How is that been for you guys market share wise, do you seeing any opportunities there? Is there any impact on the microcontroller marketplace from those transactions?
Ganesh Moorthy: There is nothing I can point to in the near-term that results in market share changes from what just described. Obviously as the combination for NXP and Qualcomm complete they will be restructuring actions that will be announced, some of that will create opportunity for us, we’ve seen that in prior combinations as other have gone through. And we expect to gain our unfair share on that. Renaissance is a more of a mystery and lot of their business is really transacted in Japan, Japan is not always the easiest of market for a non-Japanese manufacture to be able to breakthrough. But we have seen Renaissance opportunities outside of Japan and that is not just something recent that has happened ever since the combination of Hitachi, Mitsubishi and then subsequently NEC all have taken place as people will have different challenges with Renaissance from a long-term perspective some of it natural disaster faced, many of it business faced in terms of how they have gone forward.
Chris Stanley: Got it. And as follow-up, now that things are starting to settle down and you really have your arms wrapped around Atmel, how would you characterize your thoughts on the relative growth rate that your analog versus your microcontroller business going forward?
Steve Sanghi: Well, Chris, we don’t really look at it that way. There are microcontroller business units and there are analog business units and they are funded, they all looking for new products and opportunities, we don’t have a model in mind that we have to drive microcontroller to a given percentage and analog to a given percentage at the expense of the other. So each find its markets and growth and some are connected because of attach and wherever the numbers fall the percentage of analog or percentage of microcontroller is a math, it’s the output, it’s not the input.
Chris Stanley: Got it. Okay. Thanks guys, Steve now that you’ve got fixed Atmel, can you come around for Governor of California fix those state like you fixed Atmel, please.
Steve Sanghi: I should get my head examined.
Chris Stanley: Thanks.
Operator: We’ll continue on to Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates.
Gil Alexandre: Good evening, wonderful job. Question on your inventories aren’t they a bit light or where would you like them to be at the end of third quarter.
Steve Sanghi: Our inventories definitely on the lighter side they are lower than they have been in recent past. But every quarter we have been kind of beating the numbers and honestly not been able to build the inventories we set a target where the inventory would slightly grow and then we ship it all and the inventory does not grow. Last quarter especially we shipped all those product requested by the customers because of the go live shipping out. So that product got shipped otherwise that would have been in the inventory. So if the inventory builds a little bit in the coming quarters we will not be disappointed but we haven’t been able to build them.
Gil Alexandre: Could you give us an insight on what your R&D expenditures will be for this year?
Steve Sanghi: So no significant change, I think if you look at our current model for this quarter of 24.5% non-GAAP R&D is about…
Ganesh Moorthy: 13.5% to 14%.
Steve Sanghi: Its in the 13% range or so, so whatever model for the revenue you want to use for the year, but 13% and that would be pretty good approximation.
Gil Alexandre: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Caso with CLSA.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. just question as you move towards the long-term operating model are there any discrete items in there – discrete things that you need to accomplish there or is this more of just kind of the normal revenue growth and blocking and tackling going forward.
Steve Sanghi: Lot’s of moving parts, mostly blocking and tackling but the completion of the Atmel integration, which means all the duplicate expenses after go live going away, which will be really completely gone away next quarter then you got all the cost savings from Micrel fab into the P&L. Remember we ship in first-in, first-out and we close the fab in the November timeframe. So you’ll see some this quarter, some next quarter, some may even filter into the following quarter. Then as the business is rising the utilization in all of our factories is increasing. In the last couple of months we have increased wafers in essentially all three of our fabs, the wafer starts. So as the number of wafer starts continue to increase with the revenue growing this year there is a higher utilization treating to gross margin, then Ganesh talked about applying our assembly test technology to some of Atmel’s products and bringing them in that would be beneficial doing the same thing from Micrel that thing is continuing. The utilization is also improving backend factories we have three of them now, two in Thailand and one in Philippines, the Philippines one came from Atmel. So its really all those things the pricing increase on Atmel that we have instituted some is done, some is underway, some yet to be done, some customers had stage pricing increase and the last piece doesn’t go effective for a while. The new customers where winning from Atmel products have better Microchip kind of pricing, very old pricing and that’s kind of a gift that keeps giving. So it’s just lots of different things.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes, I’d maybe add one more thing to that. We’ve got an internal team looking at cost within the wafer fab with the joint factories working together to find the best cost to be able to bring to the table and that’s creating significant opportunity today and into the future of cost that are coming out.
Steve Sanghi: Yes.
Chris Caso: All right. That’s very helpful. Thank you. As the follow-up you talked about – I think you said you expected to be under 2.1 net debt EBITDA by the end of March 2017. What should we expect after that in terms of priority for use of cash going forward? Are you interested in doing something else? Are you looking to return that? What's your view going forward for use of cash?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think it was the same question asked earlier. Basically we are not changing any of the Board’s decision, but Board has discussed, we're going to maintain our dividend policy that we have today just increasing it by a very nominal amount every quarter like we have been doing and really reserve the majority of our cash for M&A’s which have been so successful. We have added so much accretion and so much of the revenue in profit and market share and all that has come from good number of acquisitions, we have done over the years.
Chris Caso: Great. Okay, thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. We will hear from Lena Zhang with Summit Redstone Partners.
Lena Zhang: Thank you. Thank you for taking my questions. And congratulations on solid results and the guidance. So Steve you did mentioned that back and specifically utilization rates improving. Would you mind to give us some numbers on that on utilization rate?
Steve Sanghi: No really, I can’t. We don't share the utilization that way. I don't really have been fingertips or other share it qualitatively, we are improving utilization in all of our three Fab’s and change to all of a three backend manufacturing implements but really not in percentage terms. The percentage is also always misunderstood you try to make a mathematical calculation of utilization going from one number to second number and try to derive that gross margin. It doesn't tend to see really kind of correlate that well that way. This is different complexity of processes and you could be doing a higher value added step outside and being a lower value added up inside and utilization looks higher. But the change may not be as much. So we haven't seen the street decode utilization to gross margin as well, and I think it adds to confusion. So we tend not share it.
Lena Zhang: I see, thank you. That’s all I have.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Operator: And we will go to Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.
Rajvindra Gill: Yes. Rajvindra Gill. Thanks and congrats on phenomenal results. Steve, I wonder if you could perhaps characterize the demand environment that you're seeing across the different segments as well maybe any color on the geography. Any view on kind of overall demand that will be helpful.
Steve Sanghi: Well, I mean all this is not strictly speaking about Microchip really nothing to say about the overall semi-industry. We're finding that demand environment to be normal. Really I mean if you look at the industry numbers for 2015 and 2016, I believe 2015 industry was low single-digit negative and so the numbers I've seen for 2016 was plus 1% give or take some. And the numbers for 2017, I'm hearing numbers to be positive. So after two years of really flatter down industry, I'm hitting industry numbers to be positive but not giving any personal view on it. When I look at the Microchip opportunities and we see our markets in U.S., Europe, Asia and Japan, I'm seeing market to be normal.
Rajvindra Gill: And a question on the IoT market specifically on the industrial IoT, this seems to be a lot of momentum going on in that particular sub-segment. Wondering if you could provide any thoughts on that market and how you're your position with your portfolio of connectivity microcontroller or your distribution channel?
Steve Sanghi: So I think we've always believe that the industrial market is where the true strength of a IoT fits. It's where there are very strong business models for the investments that are required in the IoT infrastructure that's going to be put in. We have many, many designs that I would fit within that category. And we're optimistic how that growth will be a part of our overall growth going forward.
Rajvindra Gill: Thank you. Congrats again.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we will go to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin Cassidy: Thanks for taking my question. I congratulations also. My question was through around the semi-conductor industry and whether you've seen any change in behavior from your customers and with the consolidation in the industry. Are they giving you better visibility for orders, as Ganesh had said earlier that lead times have been stable and just seems like we're a long cycle and do you think this as the semi-conductor industry changed and less cyclical?
Steve Sanghi: I think from the consolidation – I don't think lead time behavior is any different. And the behavior that’s different is on pricing. There are customers who have recognized that the industry has consolidated, it has changed and how they were able to essentially, molest the supplies before to constantly get lower prices. It's less possible today if supplies are standing up to them. Many customers have realized that in many customers painfully realizing it and not quite accepting it and fighting it, but losing.
Kevin Cassidy: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And with no additional questions in the queue, I’ll turn the floor back over to Mr. Steve Sanghi for additional or closing remark.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you for everybody for attending the conference call. We are pleased to deliver an outstanding quarter. And we'll see some of you on the road as we attend various conferences this quarter. So thank you, bye-bye.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen once again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all, again for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip Technology Second Quarter of the Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal 2017 financial performance and Steve, Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were a record $873.8 million. They were well above the high end of our guidance and were up [3.5%] sequentially from net sales of $844 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $2.5 million higher than GAAP net sales as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP recognizes the Atmel Asia distribution network as having sell-in revenue recognition. Our non-GAAP results are being presented on a full sell-through basis to provide investors with a better view of the true end-market demand for our products. We will start recognizing revenue on a sell-through basis for the Atmel Asia distributors effective October 1. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.2% in the September quarter and significantly above the high end of our guidance, which was 56.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.7% of sales, significantly below the bottom end of our guidance range of 27.2% and non-GAAP operating income was 30.5%, well above the high end of our guidance of 29%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $219.6 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $0.94, which was $0.05 higher than the high end of our guidance of $0.89, up 11.6% on a sequential basis and up 42.6% as compared to the same quarter last year. On GAAP basis, net sales were $871.4 million, and gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 47.1% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $4.1 million of share-based compensation, $1.5 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier and $84.3 million in acquired inventory valuation costs. Total operating expenses were $347.9 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $80.4 million, share-based compensation of $20.3 million, $4.1 million acquisition-related and other costs and special charges of $9.5 million. With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition related charges and the related tax impacts, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $35.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share. In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 9.1% and the GAAP tax rate was negative 40.9%. We expect our longer-term, forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8.5% and 9.5%. Share-based compensation for Microchip in the June 2016 quarter was extraordinarily high at $59.6 million related to the restructuring we had with the Atmel acquisition. The share-based compensation came down significantly in the September quarter to $24.4 million, and we expect the share-based compensation to be about $23 million in the December quarter, which is more indicative of the ongoing run rate for these expenses. Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at September 30, 2016 was $424.7 million and all of the fair value markup on the Atmel inventory, as required by GAAP purchase accounting, is now off of the balance sheet. There is still $12 million of fair value markup relating to Atmel sitting in the distribution inventory balance at the end of September. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 103 days of inventory at September 30, 2016, down 4 days from the end of the June quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 31 days, which was down from the June quarter level of 32 days. Cash generation in the September quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was a record $211.2 million. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $490.8 million. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of September 30 were $1.678 billion and will result in a 25 basis point reduction in our borrowing rate once we file our September quarter 10-Q later this week. Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels in our acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $170 million to $200 million in the December quarter. We continue to make good progress on our leverage with our net debt to EBITDA, ending the September quarter at 2.91. This is down from 3.22 at the end of the June quarter and better than our projection we had shared with the Street last quarter of 3.02. We expect our net debt to EBITDA to be about 2.35 by the end of fiscal year 2017. Capital spending was approximately $18.2 million in the September quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $110 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $30 million. For several years prior to fiscal 2016, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders had been treated as return of capital, as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. In fiscal 2016, about 60% were treated as taxable dividends and about 40% were treated as return of capital. In fiscal 2017, we expect our dividends paid to shareholders to be treated as return of capital. Please note that the first quarter of calendar year 2016 will have approximately the same 60% taxable dividend and 40% return of capital split as the fiscal 2016 dividends. We will continue to keep investors updated if anything changes on our expectations of the dividend treatment as we progress throughout the year. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business in the September quarter was up 3% sequentially, as compared to the June quarter, setting a new record in the process. Our microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, as well Atmel's microcontroller business were each up nicely in the September quarter, as compared to the June quarter, as we continued to experience broad-based growth in our business. In addition, each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses were up sequentially and achieved new records for revenue. Even as we grow our 16-bit and 32-bit business in leaps and bounds, Microchip's overall 8-bit microcontroller business, as well as Microchip's 8-bit microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, achieved new records for revenue in the September quarter, once again demonstrating the resilience and consistency of this business. We believe that reports of the death of the 8-bit microcontroller market are greatly exaggerated and limited only by the imagination and willingness to offer innovative new solutions. During the quarter, Atmel's customers continued to feel reassured about Microchip's microcontroller roadmaps, going forward, exemplified by the introduction of the first new AVR microcontrollers and SAM 32 microcontrollers on Microchip's watch. As a result, we are seeing continued growth in our design and funnel and expect this to drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time. In regards to the Microcontroller business units integration, we had already made significant progress in the June quarter and largely completed the remaining integration efforts in the September quarter. The wireless business restructuring, which was still a work in progress at the end of June, has progressed significantly since then and will be completed by the end of December. This business was running at a large loss and required significant and rapid surgery to combine roadmaps, reduce redundant spending and rationalize priorities. Our touch and gesture business, focused on automotive, industrial and commercial markets, took further shape in the September quarter and we are driving opportunities with a stronger set of customers and channeled relationships as well as a stronger combined sales team. Steve will give you an update a little later on the sale of the Mobile Touch business, which did not fit our business goals that we have been marketing for sale to interested buyers. We implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process to ensure that not only are we being competitive, but that we are also getting appropriately rewarded for providing innovative solutions that enable our clients to successfully achieve their business goals. The benefits of the pricing changes we made were partially seen in the September quarter, and we'll have some residual benefit in future quarters. Finally, microcontrollers had over $2.2 billion in annualized revenue, representing 63.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market, which have been augmented by the addition of Atmel's portfolio. We continue to gain market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Moving now to our analog products, our analog business was up 4.7% sequentially in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter, and also set a new record. At approximately $900 million in annualized revenue, our analog business represented 25.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. During the quarter, we continued an active effort to find opportunities to attach Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel Microcontrollers at customers and applications that we otherwise did not have visibility into. This effort is progressing well and will pay dividends over time as new design wins go to production. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface, timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our analog business as we march relentlessly towards making analog a greater than $1 billion revenue business for Microchip. Moving to our memory products, our combined Microchip and Atmel memory businesses were down 2% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. In this business, too, we implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process for the Atmel business to ensure that while we are competitive we're not chasing bad business in the pursuit of profitless prosperity. Summarizing some of the other Atmel integration elements, our sales integration is progressing well with extensive cross training of our direct sales teams as well as our channel partner sales teams. Microchip's major channel partners are now franchised to carry Atmel products and most Atmel channel partners are franchised to carry Microchip products. Between training and enabling our channel partners, we want to leave no stone unturned as we work to ensure that we maximize the cross-selling of products on new customer design activity. We are in the midst of planning for and testing to integrate our business systems and expect to go live on the Microchip systems on January 1, 2017. This is the largest and most complex acquisition we have done and we are taking extra time to ensure we thoroughly test the changes before we go live. All in all, the second quarter of integrating Atmel has progressed on or ahead of our plans. Our thanks go out to the many employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to contribute to the rapid integration and helped deliver synergy results that are well ahead of forecast. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance is going forward and more about the Atmel integration. Steve?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2017 and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and make extensive comments on Atmel. Our September quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our non-GAAP net sales, gross margin percentage, and operating profit percentage were all better than the high end of our guidance while our non-GAAP operating expenses were less than the low end of our guidance. Additionally, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.07 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance and up 11.6% sequentially and up 42.6% from the September quarter of a year ago, due to improved gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage, and accretion from both Micrel and Atmel. We achieved record results from our core business and sequentially grew both in our core business at Microchip as well as from Atmel. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip, including acquired employees from Micrel and Atmel worldwide for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 104th consecutive profitable quarter. In the last quarter's conference call, we shared with you our first 100 day assessment of Atmel, its products and its operations. Now with 200-plus days behind us, I would update you on what we have done to correct Atmel's weaknesses in order of priority. Number one, lack of pricing discipline. We have completely turned the situation around. There are no low price, low margin quotes being given anywhere in the world. It seems that Atmel's prices were well below the market prices and there was an air gap between the Atmel selling price and the market price. Our price increases, while painful for some customers, are largely filling the air gap as we bring prices closer to the market price. Most of the products are proprietary and therefore we would not be concerned about losing business. On the distribution front, we got a lucky break as one of our largest competitor has changed their distribution program where they will be using distribution only for fulfillment and are terminating their registration program under which the distribution earned higher margin for demand creation. This is having a very positive effect on Microchip as the distribution sees a very strong portfolio from the combined Microchip and Atmel franchises and is increasing the commitment for demand creation for Microchip. Number two, high operating expense culture. Atmel had a culture of high operating expenses which routinely ran over 40% of sales. In the September quarter, Atmel's operating expense was below 28% of sales, and many of the expense reductions done were not for the entire quarter. So you will see the operating expenses continue to drop. Number three, swinging for home runs and getting large customers at low margins. This has now been corrected as we're aligning many of Atmel's sales focus consistent with that of Microchip. Number four, accountability. I said at the last conference call that Atmel had a culture of poor accountability. With the broad-based implementation of Microchip type of bonus plans which are based on overall company growth and profitability, we are rapidly changing that culture. In our presentations at Atmel, our communications with them and classes at Atmel, we are teaching that at Microchip, management is accountable. Number five, poor teamwork. Atmel did not have a culture of teamwork. Bonus and equity grants were very large at the top at Atmel and less than 30% of the employees had bonus and equity. At Microchip, 100% of our employees are on a bonus program and nearly 100% of our non-Thailand labor employees are on equity program. Rather than large equity grants at the top, Microchip spreads equity throughout the organization so that they share in the responsibility and rewards of having a stake in the company. We have also implemented Microchip's style of quarterly business unit reviews. With the entire company on a Microchip-type of common incentive program that values sales growth, gross margin, operating expense and operating profit and with our managers role-modeling the culture of accountability and teamwork, we believe that we are turning the situation around rapidly. Number six. Atmel made no investment in training and development of employees. In a short six months, over 2,200 Atmel employees or over two-third of the employee base have gone through at least one training class at Microchip. We are putting Atmel's sales and field applications engineers through a two-week extensive training that we call Boot Camp, in which we train the employees on Microchip's Client Engagement Process, our values, our culture and align them with our goals and rewards system. With no training for more than a decade at Atmel, we have much work to do but rapid changes are taking place and employees are bonding to the superior systems at Microchip, and the results are starting to improve. Now let us continue with deciphering the financial results of Microchip from the fiscal second quarter. While we will refrain from providing a line-by-line breakdown of our results between core Microchip and Atmel, we will provide some useful nuggets of information on Atmel as well as Microchip. So here are those nuggets: we achieved all-time record net sales in our core Microchip business, and the gross margins and operating margins in the core business were both stellar and sequentially up from the June quarter. Now, on Atmel, probably one of the best accomplishments is that gross margin on Atmel improved dramatically by approximately 400 basis point sequentially and was the highest gross margin achieved at Atmel in over five years. There are a lot of moving parts, but price is a big one. Price increases, the new price book, changing worldwide prices to U.S. dollars and pegging it back to when the contracts were done and protecting Microchip from a large euro and pound depreciation against the dollar were significant items. Beyond that, there was a very favorable mix also with higher growth in MCUs and the memory business and there are plenty of cost reductions mixed in. Regarding Atmel's operating expense, I mentioned earlier that Atmel's operating expense in March quarter was over 40% of net sales. Atmel's operating expense in September quarter was below 28% of net sales. With the combined effect of better than expected net sales, substantially higher gross margin percentage and substantially lower OpEx, we achieved Atmel's operating margin of over 23% of sales, which is again the highest operating margin achieved at Atmel in over five years. We achieved an accretion from Atmel of $0.145 per share versus our guidance of $0.09 to $0.11 per share. By any measure, our September quarter results are stellar. Going into Atmel acquisition, the investors and analysts had three major concerns. They were: can we grow Atmel's business? Can we improve Atmel's gross and operating margins? And can we improve Atmel's execution? The answers to those questions are yes, yes and yes. We have grown Atmel's business. We have dramatically improved Atmel's gross and operating margins and we are improving the execution. And when I say we, it does not mean we at classic Microchip, we means the new Microchip that includes all the worldwide employees of Atmel that are doing a great job improving the financial results of Atmel. So, now, let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We expect total net sales to be sequentially flat to down 6%. We expect gross margin to be between 56.6% and 57.2%. We expect overall operating expenses from continuing operations to be between 26.5% to 27% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 29.6% and 30.7% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $0.85 and $0.95 per share. The earnings per share guidance include an accretion from Atmel of between $0.13 and $0.17 per share. Last quarter, we increased the fiscal year 2017 accretion target from Atmel from $0.25 at deal announcement to $0.40. We are again increasing the accretion target from Atmel from $0.40 to $0.50 per share for fiscal year 2017. We have also assessed whether the upside in accretion from Atmel is pulling off long-term accretion or upside. As I said last quarter, there is some of both. So let me catch up the math for everyone. Our original accretion target for fiscal year 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $0.33, $0.66 and $0.90 respectively, all with full stock buyback of shares issued in the Atmel transaction. This is the target we gave you at deal announcement for fiscal year 2017, 2018, and 2019 to be $0.33, $0.66, and $0.90 respectively, all with full stock buyback of shares issued in the transaction. Now, after we decided not to buy the stock back, the accretion math took the accretion to $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. Now, we believe that the opportunity for stock buyback when the stock was under $40 is now past. So we're not going to buy the stock back and instead, create the balance sheet for a future acquisition. So our reference point for accretion for fiscal year 2017, 2018, 2019 is $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 without any stock buyback. So, once again, our reference point for accretion for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 is $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 without any stock buyback. So now our new accretion target for fiscal year 2017 without any stock buyback I already gave you is $0.50, which is up from $0.25 originally, almost a full year ahead of schedule. The new accretion target for fiscal year 2018 goes from $0.53 originally to $0.70 now; and for fiscal year 2019, the accretion target goes from original $0.75 to $0.90 now. In fact, our new accretion targets now at or above our original target when we assumed buying back stock. For fiscal year 2017, our new accretion target is 100% higher than our initial estimate, excluding stock buyback, and 50% higher than our initial estimate including the stock buyback. This is all a testament to how well the Microchip team has executed the Atmel integration in the first seven months since the close of the transaction. On Micrel side, the integration is complete, the fab will close at the end of next week, the last of wafers are coming through the fab as we speak, a large number of fab employees have already been let go. After closing the Micrel fab, we save approximately $26 million in annual wafer cost, which will find its way into the profit and loss statement over the coming quarters as we ship more and more 8-inch wafers and deplete the 6-inch inventory. After we close the fab, the final operating profit model from Micrel will meet or exceed our long-term target of 33%. We also announced last week the result of the sale process for the Mobile Touch business unit. We sold the business unit in a cross-border transaction, consisting of an asset purchase, an IP license agreement, a sales agreement for the inventory of Mobile Touch business unit and a transition services agreement. We expect this deal to close later this week. Finally, with the success we have seen so far with Atmel and Microchip and with great results from the core Microchip business, we now expect that we will achieve our long-term financial model at the end of fiscal year 2018 versus three to four years that was embedded in our forecast when we announced the Atmel deal. To remind everyone, that financial model is 59% gross margin, 26% operating expense and 33% in operating margins. With this, Operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: Yes, of course. And we'll take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on your strong execution. Steve, for my first question, I am wondering, you have reported very strong results for the last couple of quarters. How much of that would you attribute to a better organic demand environment versus share gains or just conservatism or pricing actions with Atmel products?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: We are unable to break that out for you. It's a sum total, and when we win a business, we don't know whether we're winning that business because we've got great product, because we're gaining share, whether the customer end demand was stronger, it's really always a combination. I think the sense of the overall market demand, you can get that from the average of industry announcements from our peers and competitors, and then you can compare them to our results and kind of make your own assessment.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. And my follow-up, on the gross margin, you upsided this last quarter, I was curious what drove that upside, was it the pricing action? And just if I take that forward, what is the path from the current levels you're at, to your 59% target? How much of that would be based on revenue versus other sort of self-help actions that you can take? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, again, I think your questions and intent is always to kind of piece everything, break it up. But this is kind of hard to do. I gave you nuggets of information. There was a 400 basis points improvement on Atmel gross margin, Microchip's, the core Microchip business gross margins were also up nicely. The increase on Microchip business was much more organic, better mix, better absorption with the growth, better this, better that, slightly but the 400 basis points impact on Atmel gross margin, I broke it out for you, was a result of pricing increases, setting back many of the customer contracts in U.S. dollars back to where the contract was originally done, taking away the impact of weak euro, weak pound and those kinds of things. And there was a better mix on Atmel side also. So, again, lots of moving parts.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: And over time, as we are winning new business, it's on a more disciplined pricing basis that the new business is being won. So, in that, as it goes to production four, six quarters from now, it will all be at good margins.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Right. I think the last piece of your question was getting to the 59%. There's a lot of different things that factor into that. We've got the Micrel accretion from shutting the fab, which Steve dollarized for you in his comments. Lots of cost reduction activities that are happening between the combined factory management teams of Microchip and Atmel, So, lots of good things coming.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: And moving on, we'll take our next question from William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Steve, when you closed – or when you announced the Atmel acquisition, you talked about that company's gross margins as being structurally lower than Microchip's. And I'm wondering as you've integrated and improved that business if there's any chance for a change in that view. Could you see Atmel's margin structure approach what classic Microchip has delivered?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So, it's just all a matter of timing. Yes, Atmel's business structurally is slightly lower gross margin driven by a little more consumer mix and really where they have done a lot of the contracts and pricing over time. Now, as we proceed forward, the new products we are building, the new products we're introducing, the new contracts we're doing, the work we're doing with distribution, they will all be very good similar gross margins to Microchip. But it will take a long period of time before you can pay back all the orders sins. Many of them we are correcting in increasing the prices, but many of them are old customer contracts which have clauses where we cannot change them.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And one more, if I can, related to Atmel still. Can you comment on any revenue synergies you're seeing? Obviously, the pricing discipline has helped a lot. What about cross-selling the product?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So, Ganesh commented on it, that our sales force is very much focused on identifying the analog attach opportunity across all of the Atmel's microcontroller and other products. We have done this traditionally with Microchip microcontroller products where there's a large amount of analog that goes around it and to the best of our ability, we tried to capture that attach. But getting all this Atmel microcontroller business gives us new, fresh opportunity to identify all the analog attach opportunity around it. And our sales force is identifying opportunities. We're adding them to the funnel. In many cases, there are substitute products, in many cases, there are design-in products, which will take a year or so to go to production. But in the coming quarters, you will see significant impact from analog attach to the Atmel products.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks, and congrats on the good results.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you and congratulations on all the hard work and results. You had mentioned 8-bit revenues still increasing. And could you explain a little more if it's current customers expanding their revenue or are there many new applications? Is this a phenomenon of the Internet of Things?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, it's all of the above. We have never bought Street notion that 8-bit is dead, everything is going to 32-bit. That notion has been around from 1994, and I have a cover page EE Times article from that time. And so Microchip has been short for those people since 1994, when the stock was $0.57 in the current currency. So our 8-bit business is extremely profitable, extremely good margins, operating as well as gross. The business did record on core as well as total, as Ganesh mentioned. We are continuing to introduce a large number of new products with new features. We're garnering new customers, existing customers where businesses are growing. We are not seeing what everybody keeps talking about, but please, everybody keeps talking about because that takes everyone away from 8-bit and turn to something else and we're enjoying this business quite a bit.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Maybe as a follow-on, do you see attach designs like with wireless or Bluetooth with the 8-bit? Would that be an indicator of new applications?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: You want to take that?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I don't think it's necessarily with Bluetooth and wireless. I think there are plenty of areas where people are trying to make devices smart. And if you have innovative new products available as 8-bit microcontrollers, often they are the most cost-effective products to apply to these new systems that are being designed. And we are probably the minority of companies that has innovated to put lots of new capabilities in 8-bit microcontrollers. We are doing that not only on PIC but the Microchip product line before but also an AVR, the Atmel product that we've inherited. And I think if you have products that are innovative at the right price point, which are easy to design in to many systems, they will. I don't think they're anything related necessarily to Bluetooth and wireless – and Wi-Fi specifically.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.: Hi. This is Vinay, calling in for Craig. Congrats on a solid quarter. I want to touch upon Atmel integration and acknowledging it's still early on but you're making very good progress. Could you touch upon the opportunities you are seeing for savings on the manufacturing front and any potential synergies on the back end longer term?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Could you clarify what is the managed action fund, you said?
Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.: Oh, any savings that you can accrue on the manufacturing front?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Oh, manufacturing front.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Manufacturing front. So we talked about it last quarter that we are – we have decided to keep the Colorado Atmel fab, which we found to be very cost-effective fab and very useful for our plans going forward. So we're not going to do anything. There were Street expectations that we're going to shut down that fab. We never said that and we don't know where that came from, but we are not shutting down Atmel's 6-inch Colorado fab. It's very, very nice fab. Now when you look at the back end, Atmel did majority of the assembly and test all at the subcontractors. They did no assembly themselves and 90% of the test was outside. They only did some wafer probe in Philippines. If you compare that to Microchip, we do all of our wafer probe and about 60%, 70% of our assembly and about 90% plus of our test ourselves. So that's where we see some opportunities where as we compare the assembly and test cost structure, Microchip's testing technologies, assembly technologies at lower cost than some of that Atmel is using. And we have put plans together, and some of the lead products are already getting qualified and would be in production next quarter where we're going to be shipping many of these products through Microchip's back end at much lower cost than they currently are. We have not given any guidance on what the impact of all that would be in the coming years. And I think as we get further down, we'll give you more update on that.
Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.: Got it.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: And that's what we've done on all our previous acquisitions, by the way. There are benefits to be had that are faster on materials than just combined purchasing power. There are benefits to be had in bringing selectively some of the manufacturing into our own factories and having the economies of scale to go with it. And it all takes time to put it together, qualify it, get customers qualified but eventually it does happen.
Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.: Got it. That's helpful. From a follow-up, I want to touch upon your analog portfolio like where you have pretty good scale now, right, $900 million in annualized revenue. Could you touch upon some of the growth drivers do you see for the business longer-term?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Analog is made up of thousands of products. There's no single silver bullet that's going to drive the growth across the various categories I talked about, power, mixed-signal, linear, interface, security, clocks. All of these product lines need many, many permutations and combinations to service the broad range of requirements in the marketplace. And then we're seeing nice growth in the many different categories of analog, and that's ultimately how it gets built is in a broad range of products and applications.
Vinay Jaising - Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon, and congrats on the solid quarterly performance in getting the op margins to 30%. You guys originally had a target of $4.25 per share of earnings power in fiscal year 2019. If I add the incremental Atmel accretion that you articulated, Steve, that goes to $4.40 per share but the overall core Microchip business seems to be doing extremely well as well. So how should we think about the new fiscal year 2019 earnings power?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Honestly, I don't have the math in front of me, and I don't want to make a comment that I haven't done any math on. I think I gave you the accretion map on Atmel and you could piece it back together, by figuring out what the core was and you can do your analysis. Unless I had it in front of me, I wouldn't want to make an error.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. On the closure of the Micrel fab in October, obviously that did not contribute yet to the gross margin performance, but how long roughly is it going to take for you guys to deplete the inventories out of that fab and start recognizing the benefits of the lower cost 8-inch fab and how should we think about the impact to margins and again, when does that start to kick in?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So, I would say that we've been shipping some of the 8-inch products already as of last quarter and this quarter. The amount we're shipping from 8-inch right now is only about, maybe, 10% or 15% of the overall product. Over the six months, 90% of it's probably gone. And then there is a tail end, which is longer term, which continues afterwards. So the bulk of that really comes into our numbers in the next six to nine months, I think. By June, July timeframe, I think you would have seen about 90% of it.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Danely with Citigroup.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks, guys. Steve, in the prepared remarks you talked about building cash for an acquisition. Is this a little bit of a change from what you've been thinking in the last three to six months? Why-what do you see out there? Is there some sort of sense of urgency or anything like that? And then what, if any, potential timing could this be?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: There is no change. The change is that we're not going to buy the stock back. And when I wanted to buy the stock back at $40, where the opportunity presented as low as $38. But you recall there was – Street was really concerned about China at that time and they were concerned about the leverage and they didn't want us to buy the stock back. And we were not concerned about China back in January, as I was telling you there. But the wisdom that prevailed at that time was to not buy the stock back and now the stock is in $60s. So we believe this is not the time to buy back stock. Instead, we will keep the balance sheet as stronger than levering it further by stock buyback and really prepare for the next acquisition, which we were going to do anyway. We're always looking for acquisitions, as you have seen over time.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. And then a little bit of a near-term question for my follow-up. For the guide for the December quarter, for the combined company, would you say that that is a little less than seasonal, or normal seasonality? And then any comments on what you think normal seasonality for the March quarter would be conceptually for the newly-combined company?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I don't have anything that I could give you from a guidance perspective. This will be our first quarter with Atmel last March quarter was really – you can't really compare against that. They were under an acquisition and the March quarter was terrible. They lost money in that and all these other things. So, I would say Atmel's business in the March quarter, the consumer part of the business should be down. The rest we have to see how it works out? Microchips, core Microchip March business usually is up from a low-single digits, and we have to combine that with Atmel and figure out what would happen.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And then the December quarter, please?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: In December quarter?
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. The first part of that question was, is your December quarter guidance like normal seasonality? Or is it a little bit worse than that?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well again, what's normal seasonality? I don't know what the normal seasonality is with Atmel mixed in.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Me neither. That's why I'm asking you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I don't know.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So it must be normal.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: This is the normal. This is the first time, so this is it.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Hello, Gil.
Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates: Question. As you look on the contract business, which is coming back to the states for Christmas, how do you see that business versus last year?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: The Christmas bills have shifted dramatically in time in the last five years or so and has been happening incrementally. And let me explain what the shift is. It used to be the case that most of the Christmas builds would be in our revenue in the September quarter because parts get built in Asia. So whatever is being built, equipment gets built by the end of September and gets on ships for six-week journey to U.S. over the ocean and arrives here in time for Thanksgiving when the stores are then full of merchandise. That used to be the case. Increasingly in the last five years plus, what we have seen is the Christmas build is later and later and later. Nobody rushes to build it in September anymore. Parts get built all the time in October and November. A lot of it gets shipped by air rather than getting shipped by sea. And even the heavy items sometimes it gets shipped by the sea and they arrive in November and December. And many a times, there are IOUs where certain product is not available before Christmas, and you put an IOU under the Christmas tree and then you take delivery in January. A lot of the gift card giving has driven that also where people kind of gift gift-cards and then they're actually buying the merchandise in January. So the entire Christmas buying, which largely used to happen prior to the end of September, is now really spread out.
Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates: Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you and congratulations as well. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing by end markets. Any kind of color commentary with respect to automotive, industrial, medical equipment, any insights there would be help.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: We see some of the strengths that others have responded to as well in automotive and industrial, but there's nothing that stands out. We have a part of our business that has a computing exposure to it, and the same strength that players in that space have seen we've seen as well. But it's nothing dramatic in one direction or another. It's generally consistent with what industry patterns have been.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: And I know it might be difficult to assess now, but given the consolidation that's been going on in the semiconductor industry and, namely, a massive merger in your space, microcontroller space, with NXPI and Qualcomm coming together, wondering how you're looking at the competitive environment going forward, given the consolidation that's happening around you. You've made an acquisition as well. Just wanted to get maybe a high-level thought process in terms of how you're positioning the company in light of all these external events?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, people ask us the same question when Freescale was getting acquired. They asked us the same question when Renesas was forming with NEC, Hitachi, Mitsubishi. And now we're getting the same question with NXP. And I think microcontroller market remains competitive. There are a number of players. We compete with Renesas, NXP, STMicro, Microchip, and others, some smaller players. The market remains vibrant and competitive and Qualcomm purchasing NXPI would not really change anything, because Qualcomm was not a microcontroller supplier. So the same product line that NXP had will continue, and we're not seeing any change now. Although the close of the acquisition is about a year away, we're not expecting to see any change coming out of that.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: But you've seen consolidation in the microcontroller market because it's been fragmented, and so you've seen that occur over the course of several years. And so I'm just wondering, do you see – do you anticipate more consolidation in the market within the microcontroller market or other players perhaps moving into the market that are outside of the MC space.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Honestly, Raj, there is nothing in our strategy that is saying there are a bunch of new players coming in the microcontroller market, our strategy is not based on that, we're not seeing that. If the question is: will there be more consolidation? That is sure to happen. I think there've been companies acquired in the last year, especially Altera, NXP, Freescale that we would not have – and Linear, we would not have expected those mergers to happen. So, if those can happen, I am sure there will be more mergers. But what we're not seeing is that these mergers are changing competitive landscape in any way. The players, the companies are getting larger, and we are getting larger ourselves, and have much, much larger product portfolio, full product portfolio across many dimensions with automotive, industrial, computing, IoT, so on and so forth. So we are formidable competitor ourselves today, but NXPI and Qualcomm merging together doesn't make NXPI any more scary or not scary. NXPI and Freescale merging together didn't change anything.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: If your question is about scale and our concern about that, we really don't see that as an issue. I think we've been asked that question from prior acquisitions as well. We believe we have the scale we need. There is nothing that another acquisition in its scale in some way creates a competitive disadvantage that we see.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: It is not clear that Qualcomm's sales force had a similar focus in NXPI, and then they didn't have a sales force to call on all of the thousands of NXPI customers. as much of a distribution line. We didn't think Qualcomm had factories themselves where NXPI could leverage. So there were reasons for that acquisition, whatever Qualcomm's reasons were to diversify. It's not clear to us that in terms of the microcontroller and analog offerings of NXPI, the Qualcomm acquisition makes them anything different, which could be troublesome to us. We don't see that.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the execution of both in Microchip and with the Atmel business. The first question I have, Steve, you commented that as you've been executing with the Atmel products and the Microchip products in the channel, a competitor has made a move away from their demand creation initiatives with the channel. If that's favoring you, how long does it take for that positive to show up in the financials that we would see, recognizing that microcontrollers have design-in gestation cycle? Is that sometime later in fiscal 2017 or is that a tailwind for fiscal 2018's revenue?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: We commented that that was a competitor in the channel.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Did he identify the competitor?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: No.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Okay. So, a large competitor redefined their distribution program where they essentially said that the distribution will only serve the fulfillment part of the business and they will not have the distribution be creating demand and giving them registration and then giving them the demand creation margins. So, since then, we have seen a substantial desire on the part of distribution to bond with Microchip and our combined product line is formidable, Microchip and Atmel combined. So we're getting a lot of that focus, and it will have the usual lead time of design-in, which is a year-and-a-half or so in this business, although there're always some shorter-term opportunities where either the product was designed on both sides or customer has the option to build a model A versus model B, and model A was designed with that company, model B's designed with us, and distribution promotes this model. So I think there is no negative we see coming out of this. We'll get some short-term and medium-term advantage, but a significant long-term advantage.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for that. And then the follow-up is for Eric. Eric, you mentioned that there would be a 25 basis point reduction in borrowing cost. Is that for part of the debt that is currently outstanding or would that be on any future debt?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, that's the debt that is outstanding today. Future debt would all be based on what our debt-to-EBITDA is at that point in time. If we went and had a new borrowing next week that that rate would apply until we file our next 10-Q, and that's the point where we always have to calculate what the leverage is and what the borrowing grid would produce.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Okay. So what we need to do is look at that change in rate and the pace at which you're paying down debt and use those two inputs to derive our interest expense?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: That's right. And I can help you with that.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from [Mark Delaney] with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: This is Mark Delaney from Goldman. Congratulations on the good results and thanks very much for taking the question. The question was on the Atmel price increases, which the company has talked about taking some time to fully play out. Can you help us better understand what percent, either quantitative or qualitative, you think is already being recognized? Are you a quarter of the way through or half? Any sort of relative sense about how far along you are with getting those fully into the financial metrics would be helpful.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: We're unable to provide further guidance on how far we are and how much more to go. Part of that could be competitive information and we don't want any misreading by the customers on how much more to come because at some customers where we've completely done, other customers we haven't even started. So, if you start to put the percentages on it without communicating with the customers, then it will create unnecessary concern in customers that we will be going back to them for further increases. So we cannot provide any further guidance on that.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Understood. And then for a follow-up question, I was hoping to better understand some of the puts and takes to gross margin for the December quarter. You talked about some potential tailwinds around pricing and closing down the Micrel fab. Obviously, there'd be some reverse leverage from lower sales next quarter, so just help me just better understand the reason for gross margins being down a bit and what's offsetting some of the self-help gains around pricing and the Micrel fab?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I'd say for the current quarter, it's really a product mix. There's so many puts and takes with gross margins, but I think it's probably driven primarily by a product mix one quarter to the next. We had very good product mix in the September quarter and that changes a bit in the December quarter.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.: The Micrel fab impact is farther out in time.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Micrel fab closes in a couple of weeks and then it takes a little while to decommission it and all that. So Micrel impact is really more significant in the next quarter. I think a little bit of you're seeing also from Atmel it's still a lower gross margin than Microchips and driven by – I'm sorry, Atmel is lower gross margin than Microchip and driven by Atmel's mix in the current quarter, a little more consumerish, I think it's a mix when you mix it all together, it results into a slightly lower gross margin.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Lena Zhang with Summit Redstone Partners.
Lena Zhang - Summit Redstone Partners LLC: Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations as well. Only one question. And, Steve, besides the – you mentioned that your larger competitors have switched channel program to fulfillment program and as well as the pricing on Atmel, give Atmel product gross margin up 400 basis points. And then looking at the overall September quarter gross margin up around less than 200 basis points from the last quarter, is that fair to say there was significant ASP erosion in the quarter?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: No.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: No, no. Atmel is less than half of our business, right?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yes.
Lena Zhang - Summit Redstone Partners LLC: Yes.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So, there's 400 basis points improvement on Atmel's business, but you have to average it with the overall business.
Lena Zhang - Summit Redstone Partners LLC: Okay.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Gross margin was sequentially up both on core as well as Atmel. And the overall gross margin was up by a couple of hundred basis points?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah.
Lena Zhang - Summit Redstone Partners LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: I think we can do the math. You could do the math. You're just really misunderstanding it. We didn't say there was a 400 basis points improvement on overall. It was 400 basis points on Atmel.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Right. And we did make the comment that the Microchip gross margins were up in the quarter.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Microchip, excluding Atmel.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: And moving on, we'll take our last question from Chris Caso with CLSA.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC: Yes. Thank you. I'd just like to ask a follow-up on some of your previous comments regarding your intention to build up some cash for M&A. If you talk about how you balance that against some of the repayments of debt, I would guess that net debt is probably important if you're looking to do another deal, but if you can clarify that. In addition, you've spoken in the past about some of the constraints from doing further M&A, one of which would be managing bandwidth. Obviously, your borrowing capacity would be the other. At what point do you think you would be ready to start contemplating doing something else?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, one thing I don't want anyone to read is that there is an acquisition tomorrow, we've got nothing on our plate, we are extremely busy with Atmel, we haven't done go-live, combining all these systems yet. We're doing that on January 1. We are 130% consumed. We can't do anything very short-term. So, my point simply was that rather than spending $500 million, it'll be actually more than that for the number of shares we issued in Atmel transaction will now be $600 million, $650 million. Rather than spending $650 million on buying the share back, which is really kind of a lost promise now, we're going to not do that and instead leave that – leave the balance sheet with lower leverage. So, when there is new acquisition, when we are ready to do something, when there is an opportunity available, we've got $650 million more available to go forward than the other way round. But there is really nothing happening short term. When that happens, when we find the right deal, we're not going to do a wrong deal and we're not going to pay exorbitant prices that are not accretive and so on and so forth, we have always found at the right time the right deals. When we find the deal, then I'll find the money to do the deal. I'll find the money to do the deal. And next time, I'm not going to listen to your talk about leverage.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.: To the Street's comments about leverage.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Not you personally.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. Understood. Understood. As a follow-up, if we could talk a little about the utilization levels of the fab? I know there's a lot of moving parts there. You talked a bit about channel inventory, you talked about your own internal inventory both at pretty low levels. How does that affect utilization levels of the fab? And, I guess, the Micrel closure going forward over the next couple of quarters and maybe you could talk about the benefit of that to gross margins, if indeed that goes up?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: So I think that's all a positive wind on the back coming. So, as the Micrel fab closes and as you start to burn that 6-inch inventory, you have to start producing that product in an 8-inch fab, which means more demand for 8-inch products. The year has been good. We were up sequentially in the March quarter, June quarter, September quarter. So, our inventory, we just reported is 103 days of inventory, which is kind of not high by any standards. It's kind of lower by any standard we gave you before, which was more in the 115 days range. And then the Atmel inventory, when we bought them, which was very, very high inventory and over the last year, seven, eight months, we have brought Atmel inventory down significantly where it's almost corrected, not across the board, but there are places where it's really pretty much corrected. So, over the next quarter or so, I think you could see basically wafer starts going up in all three fabs, possibly, and that's really what you were asking. And when that starts to happen, then you have wind on the back. Now when you increase the wafer starts, the wafer cost comes down, but first it goes into inventory, first in/first out and its real impact on gross margin is couple of quarters later when we ship that product. Does that makes sense?
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC: It does. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Steve for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.: Well, thank you very much for attending the conference call. We'll see some of you at the CSFB Conference here in our hometown, Scottsdale. So that's in early – late November. Thank you very much.
Operator: Once again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we'll be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter and fiscal 2017 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the June quarter of $844 million were well above the high end of our guidance and were up 48.5% sequentially from net sales of $568.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $44.6 million higher than GAAP net sales as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis, while GAAP does not recognize revenue on sell-through of product sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and additionally, some of the Atmel distribution network is on sell-in revenue recognition of the GAAP, primarily in Asia. We will convert the Atmel sell-in distributors to the Microchip contracts when business systems integrate later this year. Our non-GAAP results are being presented on a full sell-through basis to provide investors with a better view of the true end market demand for our product. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 55.8% in the June quarter and above the high end of our guidance, which was 55.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.4% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range of 29.1% and non-GAAP operating income was 27.4%, well above the high end of our guidance of 26.1%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $194 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $0.84, which was $0.05 higher than the high end of our guidance of $0.79. On a GAAP basis, net sales were $799.4 million, and gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition related expenses were 43.6% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $7.9 million of share-based compensation, $23.4 million of GAAP gross margin effect from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, $90.5 million acquired inventory valuation cost and $0.8 million of other items. Total operating expenses were $407.6 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $80.2 million, share-based compensation of $51.7 million, $13.7 million of acquisition related and other costs, and special charges of $22 million. With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisitions related charges and the related tax impact, we had a GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $109.2 million, or $0.51 per diluted share. In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 8.3% and the GAAP tax rate was negative 20.4%. We expect our long-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% and 9%. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2016 was $518.4 million, including $80.9 million of fair value markup on the Atmel inventory as required for GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments Microchip had 107 days of inventory at June 30, 2016, which puts our inventory in an outstanding position. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 32 days, which is flat to the March quarter levels. The cash generation in the June quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was $184 million. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $601.8 million. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at June 30 was $1.922 billion, excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $175 million to $200 million in the September quarter. Prior to the Atmel acquisition closing, we had provided a three-year forecast for how we expected Microchip's total net to EBITDA to trend over time. In those prior forecasts, we had projected that our total net leverage at the closing of the Atmel transaction would be 3.51 and improve to 3.04 times by March 2017. We are pleased to report that we are ahead of schedule on this plan with our total net leverage ending the June quarter being 3.22 times. Capital spending was approximately $18.5 million in the June quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $110 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $30.6 million. For several years prior to fiscal 2016, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders had been treated as return of capital, as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. In fiscal 2016, about 60% were treated as taxable dividends and about 40% were treated as return of capital. In fiscal 2017, we expect our dividends paid to shareholders to be treated as return of capital. Please note that the first quarter of calendar year 2016 will have approximately the same 60% taxable dividend and 40% return of capital split as of fiscal 2016 dividends I mentioned earlier. We will keep investors updated if anything changes on our expectations of the dividend treatment as we progress throughout the year. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. With the addition of Atmel results for the June quarter and the significant size of Atmel's business, the normal quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year comparisons we've typically provided are not quite as meaningful. Therefore, today I shall give you more of a qualitative summary of our product line performance along with select quantitative summaries and also provide you an update as to how we're progressing with the Atmel integration. Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers. Our core microcontroller business, excluding Atmel as well as Atmel's microcontroller business, were both up strongly in the June quarter, as compared to the March quarter, as we continue to experience broad-based growth in our business. Strength in Atmel's microcontroller business was in part due to seasonal strength and in part because customers with completed designs felt reassured about Microchip's plans going forward and, therefore, launched their new product with confidence. All microcontroller business units for Microchip as well as for Atmel outperformed our expectations in the June quarter. Microcontrollers had over $2.15 billion in annualized revenue, represented 63.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. We made significant progress integrating Atmel's microcontroller business over the last quarter. We combined Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business along with Microchip's 8-bit PIC microcontroller business under an experienced Microchip leader. Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business, which is still very popular among a broad-based of engineers, have been starved of investment and hence atrophied over the last five years. We have reprioritized resources to reinvigorate this product line, established clear new product roadmaps, formed combined teams to execute the roadmaps and expect to release a steady stream of innovative new AVR microcontrollers that will lead its resurgence. We have also received very positive feedback from AVR customers who have longed for more innovative new products and were concerned about support for the existing products. All this while we continue to develop and introduce innovative new 8-bit PIC microcontrollers at a steady pace as before. We also combined Atmel's SAM 32-bit microcontroller business along with Microchip's PIC 32-bit microcontroller business under an experienced Microchip leader. We have established clear joint product roadmaps, formed combined teams to execute the roadmaps, and expect to continue to release a steady stream of new, innovative PIC 32 and SAM 32 microcontrollers to drive future growth. We carved out Atmel's 32-bit microprocessors as a separate business to give it additional focus. This business continues to be led by the Atmel executive who used to run the business before, who is working well with the Microchip leadership team to grow this very profitable business. This business is a good example of finding the right Microchip answer for the combined company whereby Microchip terminated our investment in a microprocessor product family that started prior to the acquisition and instead adopted Atmel's microprocessor roadmap as our future roadmap. We combined Atmel's wireless business and Microchip's wireless business under an experienced Microchip leader. This business was running at a large loss and required significant surgery to combine roadmaps, reduce redundant spending and rationalize priorities. We have made substantial progress towards this end and expect to finish the restructuring for this business in the December quarter. Atmel's touch business was organizationally and operationally split into an automotive an and industrial business which has consistent growth and profitability characteristics which we will retain and a mobile business which does not fit our business goals as we have been marketing for sale to interested buyers. An area of opportunity we identified early in April which we have worked diligently since is pricing discipline. While Atmel has many strong products and technologies, tragically in too many cases these products were sold at prices that did not recognize the value of these products. We have implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process to ensure that not only are we competitive but that we also get appropriately rewarded for providing innovative solutions that enable our clients to achieve success in their business goals. We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market, which have been augmented by the addition of Atmel's products. We continue to gain market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to gain even more share as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Moving now to our analog business. Our analog business, excluding Atmel as well as including Atmel, were both up nicely in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products is one of our greatest growth opportunities as our sales teams and channel partners incrementally attach them to Atmel microcontrollers at customers and applications that we otherwise did not have visibility into. Our analog business at approximately $860 million in annualized revenue represented 25.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed signal, power, interface, and timing products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. And now have the line of sight for analog to be a greater than $1 billion revenue business for Microchip. Moving to our memory products, our combined Microchip and Atmel memory business, which is comprised of Serial E-square memory products as well as SuperFlash memory products performed well in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. We made significant progress integrating Atmel's memory business over the last quarter. We combined Atmel's memory business and Microchip's memory business under an experienced Microchip leader. The product lines offer many substitutable products and while we will continue to support both product lines for customers who don't wish to switch. For the great majority of customers we will converge to a best of breed memory product, which has the lowest overall cost and the best overall customer value. We have also rationalized the going forward R&D investment to eliminate redundant projects either at Microchip or at Atmel, establish clear new product road maps and form combined teams to execute the road maps. In the memory business too, we identified early in April that pricing discipline was a significant improvement opportunity. We have, therefore, implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process for this business to, to ensure that we are competitive and don't chase bad business in the pursuit of profitless prosperity. Our sales integration is well underway with Microchip and Atmel teams reporting to common leadership in every region of the world. We have begun extensive cross-training of the teams and we are actively working to ensure that we maximize the cross-selling of products for new customer design activity. We have also started franchising Microchip channel partners to carry Atmel products and Atmel channel partners to carry Microchip products. We are in the midst of planning to integrate our business systems and are working towards making this happen in the December quarter. We are also systematically reviewing our internal and outsourced manufacturing activities, as well as our overall procurement activities to find the efficiencies that will reduce cost and also position us better for future growth. All-in-all, I have to say that our first quarter of integrating Atmel has gone well despite challenges along the way. Our thanks go out to many employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to contribute to the rapid integration and help deliver synergy results that are ahead of forecast. Let me now pass it to Steve for general comments about our business, our guidance going forward, and some more about the Atmel integration. Steve?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2017 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2017. I will also make comments b on the progress of integration for Micrel and make extensive comments on Atmel. Our June quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our non-GAAP net sales, gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage, and earnings per share were all above the high end of our guidance. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.095 per share, better than the midpoint of our guidance and up 19.6% sequentially from the March quarter due to improving sales, gross margin, operating expense leverage, and accretion from both Micrel and Atmel. We achieved excellent results both from our core business at Microchip as well as from Atmel. This was also our 103 consecutive profitable quarter. Last month we made our first 100 day assessment of Atmel, its products and its operations, and we shared them with the employees of Atmel. Today, I would summarize and share that first 100 day assessment with the investors and analysts. First, let me cover Atmel's strength. Atmel has good products and technologies. This is what was visible to us from the outside when we competed with Atmel and we have confirmed that, in general, Atmel has very good products in microcontrollers, microprocessors, memory, wireless, high-voltage analog, car access, security and touch products. As we have come up with common roadmap and common technologies to design future products, Atmel's products and technologies have strong presence in those joint roadmaps. The vast majority of the people left at Atmel after our initial restructuring, we have found are strong in the areas of expertise, recognize that the business was run poorly and are eager to adopt our culture and create a strong, results-based future for the combined company. Then as we look into Atmel's weaknesses, we have summarized those weaknesses in six major areas. First is accountability. Atmel had a culture of poor accountability. The dismal financial results of the last few years say it all. That is why we had to make drastic leadership changes at Atmel early on. Second area was poor teamwork. Atmel did not have a culture of teamwork. Instead, the company was highly siloed into various business units and other functional groups. The business units, sales and operations did not constantly communicate to adjust the factory build rates to changing demand. This routinely resulted in very high inventory buildup and significant inventory write-offs. We have put the entire company on a Microchip type of common incentive program that values sales growth, gross margins, operating expense, and operating profit. With our managers role modeling the culture of accountability and teamwork, we believe that we will turn this situation around rapidly. Third area was that Atmel had a culture of high operating expenses, which routinely ran over 40% of sales. The culture was one of spending what is needed versus what can be afforded. Atmel had a very top-heavy management structure with very poor accountability, leading to significant underperformance. Since the acquisition, we have removed 33 of the 41 vice presidents in the company. That layer is not needed and will not be replaced. Second, Atmel had a very poor operating expense discipline in R&D. Many R&D projects were continuing despite low gross margins and poor return on investment. Combining the roadmaps of Microchip and Atmel, we terminated many projects with poor return on investment and restructured the expenses that were no longer needed. And the worst performance of any business unit was in wireless where Atmel lost $32 million on sales of $40 million in 2015, all in the name of the buzzword, IoT, or Internet of Things. Microchip's IoT portfolio is very strong and we merged Atmel's wireless roadmap with Microchip's. We have been doing substantial restructuring to get the expenses in line with what the business can afford and which is consistent with the merged roadmap. And third on the operating expense side was sales and distribution. Atmel had a sell-in driven sales model and a commission-driven sales force that made commissions irrespective of company profitability. A few former sales employees have told us that the customers liked Atmel. Well, if you allow me to sell a large amounts of $1 bills for $0.90, I can get a lot of love from the customers too. Microchip's customer relations are built on charging a fair price for our proprietary value-added products. There's nothing wrong with some healthy and constructive tension with customers on the pricing front. Our customer relations are generally healthy and our success can be seen in our numbers and our market share. We have received some criticism from ex-employees that we're happy shipping at low prices and low margins. We believe that such criticism was expected from the employees who were vested in the status quo. The fourth area is swinging for a home run. Atmel had a culture of swinging for the fences in terms of going after large accounts and often signed onerous contracts with them. Atmel often struck out and lost many of the designs or won them at very low gross margin. Microchip will expand Atmel's customer base and target a very broad base of 100,000-plus customers like at Microchip. The fifth area is the lack of pricing discipline that Ganesh also commented on. Atmel had a very poor pricing discipline. We immediately expired a lot of low margin and negative margin quotes to bring some sanity to the pricing. We have also implemented a new price book beginning July 1 and we now begin the hard work of implementing the new prices, customer by customer. We will see the positive effects on gross margins in the coming quarters. This is something we have done successfully in our previous acquisitions. In case of Atmel, most of the products are proprietary and, therefore, we will not be concerned about losing a lot of business. We have also heard a concern that customers would have bought a lot of product early ahead of the price increases. At the direct OEM customers, the pattern of customer orders and shipments into July has continued after the new prices went in effect. So the concern is unfounded. In case of distribution, we only recognize non-GAAP revenue on sell-through basis and we wrote up the distribution inventory to the new prices on July 1. So any previously purchased inventory, if still on the distribution shelf, would have been marked up on July 1. The point of sale trends in July are not showing any noticeable negative effects from the pricing changes. And number six, Atmel made no investment in training and development of employees. At the higher level of the company it was largely a revolving door with an average tenure of executives at less than three years. In contrast, the average tenure of executives at Microchip is over 20 years. We make substantial investment in training and development of employees and then promote largely from within, thus retaining substantial talent base and experience. We have begun implementing Microchip's training and development curriculum at Atmel. Now, after giving you this 100-day assessment of Atmel, now let me continue with deciphering the financial results of Microchip from the fiscal first quarter of 2017. While we recognize that some analysts have interest in breaking down organic and non-organic net sales, we have made a decision to not provide the breakdown between organic and non-organic sales. We have seen such data largely misinterpreted. In some of my interactions with investors, I have seen them taking our GAAP sales from the SEC filings, subtracting the non-GAAP sales from acquisitions that we broke out previously and then conclude that organic sales were down or flat. GAAP net sales in the SEC filings ignore the sales out from distribution that are from the products shipped into distribution prior to the close of the acquisition. This confuses the investors since GAAP net sales look lower. And if you then make the assumption that the sales from an acquisition was a given number that we provide, then the natural and wrong conclusion that you reach is that organic sales were down. This confusion is partially the result of wacky accounting rules on acquisitions related to distribution sales. In case of Atmel, this will be even more confusing, because GAAP net sales in the SEC filings will be based on sell-in revenue recognition in Asia, while the non-GAAP net sales that we are focusing on is based on sell-through revenue recognition in Asia. Now, when we acquire a company our focus is to grow the sales and earnings of the new joint company. And we focus our resources on the best opportunities from the combined company. For example, in case of Atmel, as Ganesh also pointed out, we have fully combined each of the 8-bit microcontrollers, 32-bit microcontrollers, wireless and memory businesses of both companies. Each of these business units are now headed by a Microchip executive, who is managing it as one business, taking the lowest cost product, manufacturing through to the lowest cost supply chain and then shipping it at the highest ASP opportunity irrespective of whether the die, assembly or test comes from core Microchip side or Atmel side. Trying to artificially balance both businesses of Microchip and Atmel is less than optimum solution and makes no business sense once we are one company, and we will not do it. Therefore, we will refrain from providing a line-by-line breakdown of our results between core Microchip and Atmel. We will, however, provide some useful nuggets of information on Atmel as well as Microchip. So here are some of those nuggets. We achieved all-time record net sales in our core Microchip business. Gross margin from core Microchip business was very strong at 59.75%, up 130 basis points sequentially, and operating profit from our core Microchip business was 33.4% of sales. Gross margin on Atmel improved significantly from the March 2016 quarter prior to the acquisition. March 2016 quarter, while never formally announced, was a very weak quarter in sales as well as gross margin percentage. Now, let us decipher the operating expense where we made very significant progress. Microchip's operating expense in the March quarter was $153.5 million, and Atmel's operating expense in the March quarter was $100 million. So adding them together, our starting point is $253.5 million. The total operating expense in the June quarter was $246.4 million, a reduction of $7.1 million for the quarter, or $28.4 million annualized. Out of this $246.4 million OpEx, $6.4 million was attributed to mobile touch business which is an asset held for sale. Therefore, the operating expense on our continuing business was $240 million per quarter, or 28.4% of continuing sales. With the combined effect of better than expected net sales, higher gross margin percentage and lower OpEx, we achieved an accretion from Atmel of $0.08 per share versus our guidance of 0 to $0.05 per share. We worked very hard to make up for how much Atmel's business had atrophied prior to the close of the acquisition. On the core Microchip side, without Atmel, we achieved a record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 per share versus the $0.72 per share midpoint that was embedded in our guidance. So, again, summarizing, we achieved $0.08 accretion from Atmel, and the non-GAAP earnings per share on the Microchip side was $0.76 versus $0.72 per share, which was embedded in our guidance. By any measure, our June quarter results were stellar. We performed excellently on our organic business, as well as from Atmel and we reversed the sales decline for Atmel, marking the March 2016 quarter as the bottom. One quarter does not make a trend, so we are working hard to make sure that it does become a trend. So, now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for September quarter. We expect total net sales, including Atmel, to be up between zero and 4% sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 55.6% and 56.2%. We expect overall operating expenses from continuing operations to be between 27.2% and 27.9% of sales, marking another significant reduction in Atmel's operating expenses. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 27.7% and 29% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $0.83 and $0.91 per share. The earnings per share guidance includes an accretion from Atmel of between $0.09 and $0.11 per share. Now, if you combine the accretion from Atmel for first quarter, which was $0.08 and the midpoint for the second quarter, which is $0.10, then $0.18 of accretion from the first two quarters against our guidance of $0.25 accretion from Atmel for the entire fiscal year 2017, the fiscal year 2017 guidance seemed like a gimmie. So we are increasing the accretion target from Atmel from $0.25 previously to $0.40 now for our fiscal year 2017. We are not changing Atmel accretion guidance for the outer years yet. We have not yet completely analyzed how much of the upside is pull-in of the accretion and how much is upside. And there's likely some of each. Moving to Micrel, we are essentially in the final stages of completing the integration. The last wafer starts in the Micrel 6-inch fab are being made this week. With the last wafer starts this week, we should be closing the Micrel fab in late October. This is about two months ahead of what we guided last quarter. After closing the Micrel fab, we save approximately $26 million in annual wafer cost, which will find its way into the profit and loss statement over the coming quarters as we ship more and more 8-inch wafers and deplete the 6-inch inventory. After we close the fab, the final operating profit model for Micrel will meet or exceed our long-term target of 33%. I also have an update on the sale process for the mobile touch business unit. As of the deadline to receive offers for that business last week, we have several offers for the mobile touch business unit. We have a board review of the process later this week. Depending on the party we select and depending on the remaining diligence needed, we expect to be able to complete the sale of the mobile touch business unit well before the end of the calendar year. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: We'll go first to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. First question – just encouraging to see the Atmel accretion level but there has also been some questions just on sales, so just your point that it bottomed in the March quarter, Ganesh also made the point that customer confidence is helping. So anything else you could add in terms of context from a visibility perspective as you look at Atmel's sales as we go forward?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We basically see no issues. We do not see a decline in Atmel sales. We think we have turned around the decline of Atmel sales rapidly. A lot of the sales decline was happening during all the time when Atmel was on sale, starting almost May of last year when the CEO first told the world that he was going to step down, which began the sales process. And there were some sales decline related to the touch business even happened in the previous years. We think the meetings we have had with the major customers, the messages we have given to the Street, the messages we have given to the sales force, the meetings we have had with the distribution, rapidly we have given the market confidence that number one, we're not obsoleting a large number of products like many times acquisitions companies tend to do. Microchip has a culture of not obsoleting products and providing long-term service to the clients. The only business we put on sale was just this mobile touch business which was a relatively small business and the other concerns, which actually investors had more than the customers, was what was going to happen to the 8-bit AVR business, what was going to happen to Atmel's microcontroller together with Microchip's microcontrollers, who were competitive. All that has worked out extremely well. We have given customers the confidence that we're going to continue promoting those products, introduce new products; in fact, take many of the great features that we have added on our 8-bit microcontrollers, while Atmel's 8-bit microcontroller has atrophied. We're introducing new products with many great features and giving the messages that the brand of Atmel AVR is here to stay.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for that color. Just as a follow-up, on the manufacturing side, and understanding it's just one quarter, but any color on their kind of front-end wafer fab from a cost perspective, and then also potential synergies on the back end longer term?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So we have found Atmel's wafer fab in Colorado Springs was a very cost-effective fab. It may be one of the most cost-effective fabs in the world at a 6-inch level. Not very many 6-inch fabs can effectively compete with 8-inch output where a lot of the Microchip output was 8-inch. This is a very competitive fab. So, after a very thorough analysis – and we've got good manufacturing head on us, I think you've seen it over the years, we have decided and told the Colorado fab people and the community that we will keep Colorado fabs where some of the rumors were something else could happen. That's a very, very good fab. We're going to keep it. We have – also using Atmel's 6-inch fab to transfer some of the more sticky Micrel 6-inch products where we had had trouble bringing them on to 8-inch. It seems like the 6-inch to 6-inch transfer has been smoother than the 6-inch to 8-inch transfer on just a handful of products. We're talking about two process technologies and a few products. 85%, 90% of the products from Micrel really have been transferred to Microchip 8-inch fabs, and it is really the Atmel 6-inch fab that came to the rescue which then allowed us to not only close the Micrel fab and actually close it two months ahead of the schedule we gave you last time.
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: And on the back end, Atmel has an excellent facility in the Philippines that adds to our two facilities in Thailand. We are continuing to operate that and intend to do that for a long time. There are no transfers yet of bringing product in. Those are all in the planning stages and as we get farther into the business integration, we'll do more there. In the meanwhile, as I mentioned, we are working to get the best overall pricing when we have outsourced assembly or test, where either one of us is using a particular source, and that type of cost-reduction work which is quite common in the early stages of an acquisition.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you for taking my question. I was just wondering, Steve, if you would call the current demand environment seasonal and if you could give us some color on end markets which are behaving at or better or different than what you would expect from a seasonal perspective in the current quarter?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'm not going to call the demand environment anything. The demand environment is what it is, and based on the guidance we have given. Because any adjective I add to it and everybody tries to read that and apply that to the rest of the industry and other people and I'm just not going to do that.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just in terms of end markets that you are seeing, which are different than – or instead of comparing it versus seasonal, if you could just give us some color on an absolute basis that as we look from Q2 to Q3 and we look at the midpoint of your outlook of about 2% sequential growth, what end markets could be above or below that number? Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: We serve such a large number of customers and a broad base of applications that we're not end-market-focused on what we go do. So I think what you're seeing in both our guidance and the relative comparisons are, it's normal business. There is nothing that stands out as bad, or stands out at good. It's just normal.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And then just maybe as a follow-up, if you look at M&A, that has been a key part of your strategy longer term. But with all the consolidation that has taken place in semis, do you see enough interesting targets to go after – I realize Atmel will probably occupy your attention for some period of time, but what's your view overall on the consolidation in the sector and do you see enough interesting targets to go after?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, there is no shortage of interesting targets. The shortage right now I have is basically one financial shortage for the leverage which is already 3.22 as we reported today. So I don't really have sufficient more cash to do anything short term. And the second issue is the management bandwidth. As you mentioned, it's really very, very busy on consolidating seven different business units of Atmel and all the financial and IT and other systems. So those are the challenges, financial as well as the management bandwidth. There is no shortage of target.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Caso with CLSA.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is regarding some of your efforts to instill some pricing discipline. You talked about this at length in your prepared remarks. How long does it take for some of this price discipline to work its way through the system and is that included in the accretion target that you've already provided or would that be potentially be a source of upside for those targets?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Those are included in us taking the accretion targets up from $0.25 before to $0.40 now. They're not all driven by price. They're driven by just being so far ahead in the first two quarters and then modeling the third and fourth quarter. Some of the price increases are embedded in there but it's really very hard to model it really, because it could take a few quarters for it to really get in based on new projects, new orders, new quotes, some of the old quotes have an expiry and so on and so forth. So it's probably at least a nine-months process.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. That's helpful. As a follow-on question, obviously the business has changed quite a bit with the acquisition. Can you help us in how we should think about seasonality over, say, the December quarter and even into the March quarter, how has the integration of the acquisition changed what we would be considered...?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, first of all, we haven't seen a full year of Atmel under our clock. So the correct answer would be I don't know. But based on what we have seen, we believe that I don't think seasonality will change a whole lot. Q1, the calendar Q1 usually Microchip has been sequentially up in Q1. And because of a little more consumer exposure, Atmel's Q1, calendar Q1 has not been up, has been down. But they're about less than half of our business. So you combine it together, I think you take a little bit from the Q1 and where you add it we've got to figure out where you add it. Maybe you add it in the June. Maybe you add some in December, maybe we're not down as much. We've just got to kind of figure it out over time.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. That's helpful though. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on the strong result. I guess my first question is for either Steve or Eric. Stock-based comps in the quarter was a lot higher than I would have thought. It was a lot higher if I just added Microchip plus Atmel coming out of the March quarter. So is there something related to the acquisition going on there and is close to $60 million a quarter the new baseline or how should I think about that?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: So there is a lot of Atmel-specific related activity in there related to – Steve talked about 31 of the 40 something VPs no longer being with us and change of control and acceleration of equity and things like that. So that had a significant impact on the share-based comp in the quarter. So that is not the ongoing run rate. If you give me a minute I can kind of look up what it will be, estimated, for the next couple quarters and give you that as the baseline.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's helpful. And then guys, maybe as my follow-on question, just going back to the $0.40 of accretion, Steve, you gave us $0.08 in June, you're guiding midpoint to sort of $0.10 in September. It sort of implies only $0.11 and $0.11 in the next two quarters, if I'm doing the math properly. And just given sort of everything you've talked about on the hard work you guys have done on integrating Atmel, it seems like there could be significant upside to that. Is there a reason why the accretion starts to level off here?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I knew that you will get there.
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: No good deed goes unpunished.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No good deed goes unpunished. I think that's the answer.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Then maybe if I could just sneak one last one in, Steve. Help me understand now with all the acquisitions under your belt where you think industry growth is and given the portfolio you have, how would you expect the longer term growth of Microchip to look relative to industry?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think in most businesses, microcontrollers and analog, we have outperformed the industry for years and years, and by combining one of the two best microcontroller franchises, Microchip and Atmel, even though Atmel didn't perform financially that well because of a number of reasons that we highlighted, we did say that the products and technologies were good. I think we are the strong microcontroller franchise, they are a very strong analog franchise; the whole wireless franchise, IoT and all that has gotten stronger with both of them combined and the memory franchise has gotten stronger, I think we should continue to exceed the growth rate of the industry, and gain market share in each of those business segments.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks, guys.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: So, just as a follow-up to your question on share-based comp, I'd expect share-based comp in the current quarter, this is a pre-tax number, to be somewhere in the $24 million to $25 million range and that would probably trend down a little bit as we get to the balance of the fiscal year on a quarterly basis.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks, Eric.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So, from $60 million that you mentioned last quarter to $24 million kind of going forward, you could kind of see how heavily the company was top-heavy and how much the equity comp and acceleration and all that was.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, guys.
Operator: We'll go next to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon, and congratulations on the solid quarterly performance. On the increased accretion targets for fiscal year 2017, you're analyzing first half at about $0.36. And so on the better results and the potential for more to get to your $0.40 target for the full fiscal year, can you guys just help us understand what specific product segments or business process rationalizations, or manufacturing initiatives you've executed on to drive these accelerated synergies?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, these will be very long answers. I think what we said, both Ganesh and I in our prepared remarks, some of the things we did. I laid out how much we took out in the operating expense, how we combined the businesses. We took nearly – 500 people are no longer on the payroll, among them about 33 executives, so there was a large amount of expense taken out, large amount of other things done. Mix is improving, product mix is improving, less focus on low margin mobile touch products, and high focus on high margin micro and others and adjustment of prices. There were just hundreds of line items. And we just, Ganesh and I and many of our executives, that's all we did last quarter, we worked on Atmel.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes, good insight there. Thanks for that. And then the channel strategy for both companies, as you mentioned before have been somewhat complementary, although you've mentioned about a much broader channel presence for Microchip. You've also talked about cross-franchising distributors, getting the Atmel products fully integrated into the order system, field sales trained, et cetera. I think you previously talked about a target of November 1 for the go live initiative. Maybe, Steve, you could just give us an update on this initiative.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So it is still on schedule for go live on November 1. There are 100 different milestones, weekly milestones for really what needs to be accomplished for that to stay on schedule. And it's on schedule right now. After this call we have another review of the Atmel integration plan for November when we go live. And I'm sure I'll hear that in the last week since I heard the report, the next set of milestones have been met and we're on schedule.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Operator: We'll take our next question from William Stein with SunTrust Humphrey.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the very strong results and outlook. I'm wondering if you can characterize the upside in the quarter on the top-line or detail for us whether there was anything in that that resulted from higher prices as you alluded to negative gross margins on the Atmel business. Did that correction help revenue in the quarter or is this more of an organic sort of unit-driven upside?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So when you're saying higher prices, are you saying customers trying to buy ahead or are you saying just the effect of higher prices on revenue?
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Either.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So I don't think either of them, because you couldn't really have any meaningful impact on prices within the quarter. Many times it's raise the prices, it's you expire a quote, the new prices on a new quote, and it just takes some time to have an effect; to have its impact that moves the needle in the very first quarter, I don't think there was any of that. Regarding the second part where expecting price increase where the customers buy product at lower prices ahead of time, we had heard that concern from the Street, maybe one of the analysts. And we don't really find evidence of that. Six weeks have gone into the quarter and the OEM bookings and shipment patterns and all that are really continuing good. We're marching well towards our guidance. And on the distribution, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we marked the distribution inventory up on July 1 with a new price book. And the point of sales in the last six weeks in the quarter is – does not show any problem.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: That's very helpful, Steve. Thanks. One more if I can. It seems very early to talking about cross-selling opportunities, but I think you talked about either, I forget, in the press release or in the prepared remarks about cross-selling analog. Can you remind us what the expectations are from a timing and magnitude perspective for cross-selling analog or other product?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So the cross-selling is already visible at the design-in level – in one of Atmel's socket, let's say, there was Atmel microcontroller, there was an Atmel wireless chip but – the LDO, the A to D converter or some sort of power management was from some other company. And there are already signs as we go through reviews of customers with the salespeople, they're already showing evidence of where some of those have been replaced by Microchip at the design level. Those are not in production at the design level in the funnel. So that's already visible. In terms of dollarizing it, it's very hard to dollarize. But when I was at a conference in New York last quarter, I essentially – what they are modeling is that there is a $300 million attach opportunity on Microchip's analog products attaching it to microcontrollers and wireless products of Atmel. And it's about $1 billion of business, $0.30 of attach rate. That's really kind of how we came about. It's not as scientific, but those are experiences on other opportunities we have done where we have attached analog.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for letting me ask a question. The pricing in the new price book, maybe to help answer some of my questions, what percentage increase were you putting in for the Atmel product?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We're not going to tell you that.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And one thing, well, you haven't talked much about the licensing business. Can you say what the – are there new contracts in process or can you talk about the licensing business?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So licensing business is doing very well. Essentially, in the licensing business, we have won the entire enchilada at the 55-nanometer and 40-nanometer, essentially every major foundry, all three large foundries, and many of the smaller foundries, they have all adopted our technology at the 90-nanometer, our technology at the 55-nanometer, our technology at the 40-nanometer. Main foundries have adopted what has been won in the last two or three years is 55-nanometer and 40-nanometer. And half of them have also signed up on the 28-nanometer and that's still under works. So I mean, basically it's all being designed with our technology. Now, it's a question of, in the microcontroller world, the technology kind of lags the microprocessor world by quite a few years. So what portion of the microcontrollers are built on 55-nanometer and 40-nanometer. If you ask the question today, that's a very small number. But it's on a very fast curve as all the new products being designed are in 55-nanometer and 40-nanometer. So as they go into production, the royalty rates will increase dramatically. So we're very positive on that business. The coming year – this year should be record, fiscal year 2017 should be record.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Maybe just expand on that. You expect that the market will stay at 28-nanometers for quite a few years, especially considering price per transistor goes up as you get lower than that?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: When you look at an embedded control, I think the center of gravity of microcontrollers today is probably 0.13. So a lot of people are migrating to 90-nanometer. 90-nanometer is probably the most ramping in terms of technology, in terms of wafers and royalty. 55 is barely beginning. I think we're going to get our first 55-nanometer check, either got it last quarter, or we're going to get it next quarter. So – and then you got 40-nanometer, then you got 28-nanometer. What we're seeing is we've got a decade of royalty stream coming up here on 90-nanometer, 55-nanometer, 40-nanometer and 28-nanometer, which will continue to grow that business. And we're already filing patents to 22-nanometer, 20-nanometer and engaging with foundries and high-k/metal gate and all that. None of this is licensed yet. It's advanced work, but 28-nanometer covers the next decade.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on excellent results. Steve, you talked about in the past when you look at acquired companies that you kind of focus on 50% of the portfolio or so and try to expand on that. With respect to Atmel, using that kind of logic, how are you approaching Atmel's new products – Atmel's products and kind of end markets based on that framework?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: What's that framework? 50% of what? I didn't understand your question.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: I think in the past when you had made an acquisition – when you made acquisitions, you've talked about focusing, I believe, you had said either 50% or majority of the revenue where you feel there's the most growth.
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: Raji, I think what you're referring to is, we've made some comments about the top 50% of opportunities of acquired companies are better than the bottom 50%. I think that's what you're getting at.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I remember that when I said that and subsequently I saw it in a report, which was a gross mischaracterization of really what I had said. So let me clarify it. So, let's say we have 100 opportunities at Microchip. And the company we acquire has 100 opportunities. To make the assumption that all of our 100 opportunities are better than all of their 100 opportunities and they should be at the bottom would be highly egotistical and would be incorrect. So what I said is that many times we find that the top 50% of the acquired companies' opportunities are actually better opportunities than the bottom 15% of ours. And therefore, when we mish-mash it together, it results in to taking some of Microchip resources and rather than harvesting the bottom 15% of our opportunities, it's better to harvest top 50% of the other company's opportunities because they may be better in whatever way. I think that's what I said. It was just a – it was a metaphor. Those are not exact numbers.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: But it's absolutely the case with Atmel.
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: Now, that's really the case. As we look at Atmel we mishmash all the products and roadmaps, we have discontinued probably 15% of our roadmap and we have filled that in with a lot of the better products coming from Atmel.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Right. And that was the point I was trying to make and ask you was, given that Atmel did have a lot of underperforming product lines and assets and it was somewhat of a fragmented business, I was just wondering using this approach that you talked about, 50% of acquired companies opportunities, how that processes is now developing?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Well, it's going very, very well. As Ganesh mentioned, we're running 8-bit microcontrollers as one business unit, 32-bit as one business unit, wireless as one business unit, memory as one business unit. So the business unit leader gets both sides together, comes up with a joint roadmap. We will discontinue these of our products, they'll discontinue those of their products, it's a joint road map that joint teams work together in accelerating those road maps. There're some redundant resources which are let go. So all that process is going very well. I think on 8-bit micro, 32-bit micro and memory, we're largely done.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Yeah.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: We're largely done. Wireless, as Ganesh said, will take us through the end of the year, calendar year, which was very complex. And on the analog, high voltage, RF front, it's in the same timeframe, end of the year or early next year. So that process is really going very, very well. Where I caution investors and analysts is, if I remember reading the commentary on what I said, they kind of look at – they looked at it like, so Microchip's bottom 15% of the revenue would go away or something like that. We're going to let go bottom 15% of our revenue, which will be a huge number. This is not the bottom 15% of our revenue, there's no change in our revenue. Our revenue is not going to go down. This is in terms of activity.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Projects.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Projects. So we are doing some projects, there're some higher priority projects and some lower priority projects. We will take the lowest priority projects of ours and substitute by the acquired company's better projects which meld in. So, overall, the portfolio becomes stronger and generates even higher revenue, more competitive pricing, better margins and all that and not equate that to – we should take combined company and take 15% of the revenue and say it's going to go away. That's where it was highly misinterpreted.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Right. I wasn't implying that at all. And just last question from me. In terms of your strategic approach of your analog products, your connectivity products, are we going to see, particularly targeting IoT, more of a focus to attach analog and connectivity product to your microcontroller portfolio whether it's Atmel's ARM based products or your own base – microcontroller-based products as you focus on IoT?
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: We do that every day. We do that every day. Today we've been doing it on our products for years and including Atmel we're already seeing in the funnel that customer level we're in the new products, Microchip's analog, memory, LAN, networking, other products, being attached to Atmel's microcontroller products and some other cases. If they have the right wireless chip is being attached to Microchip's microcontroller. So yeah, that began day one as we acquired the company and it's been happening for years at Microchip. So it's not something we need to focus on. It's something we have been focusing on.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Day one after the acquisition, the best product from either company that attaches to either microcontroller are classic for Microchip or the new from Atmel becomes the natural order in which we go to market as we take the best of the best so that we win the largest amount at a given application for a customer.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Raji, we're not buzzword driven company, never have been, and go back a year ago if you would have asked an average investor who had a stronger IoT portfolio, Atmel or Microchip, the answer probably would have been Atmel. And as we look at their business, it was a disaster. As I said, it was losing $32 million on sales of 40-nanometer. And our business was more than two, two-and-a-half times the size and much better performing and all that. So lot of that restructuring kind of has been on their side. So that doesn't mean we're not doing well in those areas. We at Microchip navigate a very, very broad beach front, we're calling on 100,000 customers, we've got to do all these things. So we can't take all of our microcontroller business and we name it IoT, like somebody else has done. That doesn't mean we are shy of IoT applications or not competitive or don't have the products and don't have the focus. We've got all of that.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much and congratulations.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Chris Danely with Citi.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. I'll be brief. Just two quick clarifications. Steve, on the upside from Atmel and Microchip, was there anything in common in terms of the upside between the two businesses, whether it's by geography or end market, or where there any areas where things were a little bit worse than you expected?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, end markets we didn't look at. I mean, we don't really do that breakdown. But when I look at geographies and product lines, I would say everything was pretty broad-based.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then on the pricing where you talked...
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Much across the board.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. And then on the pricing where you talked about improving the pricing, have you ever done that with any previous acquisitions, maybe give us some examples of have you done that in the past?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We've done that pretty much with every acquisition. Micrel was the most recent one before Atmel and the pricing practices were also very sell-in driven to distribution, making quarter end deals on heavy discounts and some of the OEM pricing were very low in Asia and we did exactly the same thing. You'll take – there were some very equivalent products from Microchip and Micrel whether they were LAN or they were in the power management area, I mean, those products, customers could choose one product or the other. And our prices would be substantially better than theirs. And after we combined Micrel, we essentially changed the pricing to our pricing. And so whether you buy their product or you buy our product, you're going to buy at our price. So we did that. We did some other things with Supertex. We did a fair amount of it with SMSC.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: With SST.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We did it with SST.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: At the end of the day if it's bad business, it's bad business. We're not interested in continuing to go forward with it. So price increases – and not all business is bad. There's always a percentage at the low end of the distribution that we have to go correct.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: SST was making some negative gross margins on flash business, taking very low margins and we sold some bad business. In a couple of deals we did back then and rest of it we raised the prices. We brought some into our testing, our system, our assembly and lowered the cost, and for years now that was 2010 and we have been running the flash business very profitably. So there's no business at Microchip is entitled to lose money.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks, guys. Congratulations.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Thanks.
Operator: So next to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.: Hey. Most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick question for Eric. Eric, this difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP revenues, how many more quarters do you expect this to last if you didn't say that already?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Well, there's going to be another leg of that that happens when we integrate business systems, because that's generally the point in time where we actually change the contracts with the distributors that historically had sell-in revenue recognitions change them to a Microchip-like contract. And so we're targeting that now to happen in Q3. And depending on the date that we integrate, that can continue for a couple of quarters though. You're going to see bits and pieces of that for the rest of the fiscal year.
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. Great. And otherwise great quarter, great guide, guys. Congratulations.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Thanks Harsh.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the good start to Atmel integration. Steve, I just thought I'd take a more qualitative follow-up on the point you made regarding the upside on accretion and not wanting to be too precise on whether it was a pull-in or upside to synergies. But can you give us some examples that would indicate that it's either, A, a pull-in of what you had outlined for fiscal 2018 or it's upside to what you and the team had been expecting?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think – so if you look at the elements of it, there is revenue, there is gross margin, and there's OpEx, really only those three things. And then there is attach rate, let's say, attaching analog and all that. If you take those four major components where the long-term accretion would come from, the upside in the quarters from a revenue side was real. That's not a pull-in. That's a real revenue upside which will continue quarter after quarter. The OpEx piece is, there's a certain amount of OpEx you need to take out and remove the bad R&D and remove the bad stuff. So any accretion we would get on OpEx if we get the job done in one year rather than two years or three years and that push-in will not have further upside, because there's a certain amount OpEx correction we got to do. And we're doing it much faster than we thought. And honestly, one of the reasons for that, in my mind, is our earlier expectation was that we will find a disaster in Europe, and Europe is harder to restructure as you all know with European laws and Works Council and all that. And that's not what we found. We found very good running businesses in Europe and we found a disaster in U.S. on the business unit side. And that's why we were able to do a lot of the restructuring in a very rapid fashion and that's largely we're kind of ahead of the OpEx goal there. On the gross margin, we haven't gotten upside in the gross margin side yet. As we talked earlier, it takes a while for price increases and cost reductions to take place. So that so far is on pace with what we guided earlier. But if you get ahead, we'll let you know. And the last one is attach. There, attach is not at a revenue stage today, it's only at the funnel stage. So maybe that helps you a little bit.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Yeah. I appreciate that. And then the follow-up is to Eric. Eric, can you provide some color just on how you're thinking about approaching debt and debt reduction given the strength that we're seeing in the business mid-year?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: We shared the information on how the net leverage looks compared to our expectations and we're ahead of schedule there, taking the net debt to EBITDA to 3.22 at the end of June. So that's good. The planning that we did on the use of offshore cash worked very well and we're probably a little bit further ahead of schedule in terms of the timing of when all that happened and that allowed that level to leave the quarter not as high as we thought it might have been. So I think we're progressing well there. We haven't updated those targets that we provided on the net levers that we shared earlier but those are still all very achievable and we hopefully will do better and get there quicker.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys.
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: I will twist Eric's arm to update those maybe at conferences that are coming up.
Operator: We will take our final question from Lena Zhang with Summit Redstone.
Lena Zhang - Summit Redstone Partners LLC: Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on the results and the guidance and also very decent work on the integrating Atmel business. I apologize if I missed this. Just as to note your pricing strategy on the Atmel products, are these prices effective for the shipping in this quarter or it will be affecting for the future orders – the timeframe?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: It's all over the place. We work with 100,000 customers, and some you do it in two steps, and some you're able to do it all, in some there was a contract in place, you couldn't do it at all. So it has to be with a new quote next year on January 1, it's all over the place.
Lena Zhang - Summit Redstone Partners LLC: And also some were already started, for example, in tail end of Q2.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Some increased prices are already in effect.
Lena Zhang - Summit Redstone Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I would look at it as a glide path from July 1 to March 31 or something like that.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: It's an analog change that's going to be continuous over time.
Lena Zhang - Summit Redstone Partners LLC: I see. Thanks.
Operator: And as we have no further questions, I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you, everyone, for attending the conference call today and we'll see some of you on the road as we go to a couple of conferences later on this quarter . Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. We're about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we'll be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel and Micrel acquisitions. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we're including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliation on the investor relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to those results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record and at the high end of our guidance at $568.4 million and were up 3% sequentially from net sales of $552 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $10.8 million higher than GAAP net sales as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of product sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and when distributor contracts are changed to standard Microchip format compared to the sell-in revenue recognition contracts that Micro previously had for certain of their distribution partners. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis gross margins were 58.4% in the March quarter, which was above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance, and non-GAAP operating income was 31.4% of sales, which was significantly above the high end of our guidance, which was 30.8%. Non-GAAP net income was $153 million resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.70, which was also above the high end of our guidance. For fiscal 2016 on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $2.214 billion and up 2.5% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58.1%, operating expenses were 27.2% of sales, and operating income was 31% of sales. Net income was $583.3 million, and non-GAAP EPS was a record $2.68 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis net sales were $557.6 million and gross margins were 54.3% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $1.9 million of share-based compensation, $5.4 million of gross margins impact from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, $18.2 million in acquired inventory valuation costs, and the manufacturing vendor material issues of $3.6 million. Total operating expenses were $222.8 million or 40% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $48.1 million, share-based compensation of $15.4 million, $5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $0.8 million. GAAP net income was $67.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share. For fiscal year 2016 GAAP net sales were a record $2.173 billion, gross margins were 55.5%, operating expenses were 39.3% of sales, and operating income was 15.2% of sale. Net income was $324.1 million or $1.49 per diluted share. In the March quarter the non-GAAP tax rate was 11% and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 16.9%. The non-GAAP tax rate does not reflect a $12.3 million benefit or non-recurring items associated with the tax audit settlement and other matters. Including Atmel, we expect our longer term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% and 9%. Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at March 31, 2016 was $306.8 million. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments flowing through the income statement, Microchip had 117 days of inventory at March 31, 2016, which is down by three days from the levels at the end of the December quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was 32 days, which is down two days from the December quarter levels. I want to remind you that historically, Microchip's distribution revenue throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis. Atmel had a mixture of sell-in and sell-through revenue recognition in its distribution channel. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Atmel distributors for the entire June quarter in order to continue to provide investors with the view of the true end market demand for our product. There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition as the inventory in Atmel's sell-through distribution channel at the date of the acquisition will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes and also because some of the contracts with the Atmel distributors drive sell-in revenue recognition for GAAP accounting purposes. The cash generation in the March quarter excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment, and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was a record $196.3 million. This includes a $22 million cash benefit from unwinding the interest rate swap that we had in place. The swap was unwound as our natural hedge of floating rate debt went away by utilizing our cash to fund the Atmel acquisition. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.665 billion; our borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of March 31 were $1.052 billion. Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels, and our acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $140 million to $160 million in the June quarter. Capital spending was approximately $16.5 million in the March quarter and $97.9 million in fiscal 2016, well below the $110 million forecast we provided on our last earnings call. We expect about $35 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $140 million, including Atmel. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $26.2 million and $103.9 million for fiscal year 2016. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon everyone. Today I'll give you a summary of our product line performance and then provide an update as to where we are with the Atmel integration from a product line perspective. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was up 5.5% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter as we experienced a broad-based recovery in our business. All three businesses – 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers – were sequentially up with the 16-bit and 32-bit businesses being up in double-digit percentages. Microcontrollers represented 59.9% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. Gartner Dataquest just released their microcontroller market share report for 2015. We are pleased to report that Microchip retained the number one position for 8-bit microcontrollers and once again gained market share in 2015. In the 16-bit microcontroller market too, we continued to gain market share, while in the 32-bit microcontroller market, our market share was about flat. The microcontroller market share data reported by Gartner is getting increasingly volatile, driven by the inclusion of smart card and NFC revenue, and is further exacerbated by our belief that this data is inconsistently reported by the company's survey. Smart card and NFC revenue has no bearing on the broad-based microcontroller market, which is a much more resilient and profitable business and where Microchip participates. We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market. Our overall microcontroller results are outperforming the market in a very competitive environment, and these results are a tribute to the relentless effort by the worldwide Microchip team. We have gained market share and we have a new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. The addition of Atmel microcontrollers to our portfolio will further strengthen our position and performance in the microcontroller market. Moving now to analog products, our analog business was about flat in the March quarter as compared with the December quarter, and was up 34.6% compared to the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2016, which ended on March 31, our analog business was up 26.3% as compared to fiscal year 2015. The strong growth and increase in market share in fiscal year 2016 was a result of our organic growth efforts as well as the Micrel acquisition. Our analog business represented 30.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power interface, and timing products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. Moving now to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash memory products, this business was down 1.8% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business, and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solution. Our Memory business represented 4.8% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. Now, an update about Atmel and where we are in the integration process. Since the close of the acquisition on April 4, we have spent considerable time understanding Atmel's businesses, organization, and systems. We're developing detail integration plans that are in various stages of completion. Where we've decisions made we begun to execute those plans while we continue to build and refine integration plans in other areas. Specific to the product lines here is where we're with our integration. We have combined Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business along with Microchip's 8-bit PIC microcontroller business under a single leader. The 8-bit AVR microcontroller, which is still very popular among a broad base of engineers, had atrophied under Atmel over the last five years as resources were diverted to touch and 32-bit microcontrollers. That stopped on April 4 as we reprioritized resources to reinvigorate the iconic AVR microcontrollers to drive growth. We expect to release a steady stream of innovative new AVR microcontrollers over the next 12 months that will lead its resurgence even as we continue to release a steady stream of innovative new 8-bit PIC microcontrollers. We have also combined Atmel's SAM 32-bit microcontroller and 32-bit microprocessor business along with Microchip's 32-bit microcontroller business under a single leader. 32-bit microprocessors, by the way, are a new product category for Microchip and are typically higher-performance and complex embedded control solutions. Unlike microcontrollers, which are Flash memory on chip, microprocessors have no Flash memory on chip and instead use much larger external Flash memories. Microchip had a PIC 32 microprocessor program, which was in its early stage of investment, and we have decided to terminate that investment as we can capitalize on Atmel's SAM 32 microprocessor roadmap, which is more advanced and already in significant revenue stage. Looking forward, we expect to continue to develop new SAM 32 and PIC 32 products exploiting specific areas of specialization that each company had carved out over the years while streamlining and harmonizing the technology and intellectual property building blocks that each will use. We have combined Atmel's wireless business and Microchip's wireless business under a single leader. The product lines have some overlap and roadmaps are in the process of being rationalized to bring the investment in line with what is appropriate for the business. In that light, one decision we made was to close Atmel's Dresden wireless development center in mid-April. There is more wireless investment rationalization that is left to do. We have combined Atmel's memory business and Microchip's memory business under a single leader. The product lines offer many substitutable products and while we will continue to support both product lines for any customer who cannot switch, for the great majority of the customers we will converge to a best-of-breed product which has the lowest overall cost and best overall customer value. We have also begun rationalizing the going-forward R&D investment to eliminate redundant projects either at Microchip or at Atmel. Atmel's touch business is in the process of being restructured into mobile and non-mobile, which is essentially the automotive and industrial businesses. We have identified the leadership structures required for two independent businesses. As we announced on April 4, the automotive and industrial touch business will stay with Microchip in the long run while the Mobile Touch business will be sold. We expect to have the two organizations in place sometime in this quarter and to begin marketing the Mobile Touch business soon after. Atmel's security solution business consists of a number of Crypto products. This is a newer field of play for Microchip and Atmel's offerings will add to and strengthen our security offerings as well as accelerate some of the solutions that Microchip had planned to independently develop. Steve will comment in more detail in his section about how we expect to see the accretion results roll out. Finally let me provide an update on Atmel's acquisition – on the Atmel acquisition in regards to our product line reporting. Atmel's standard microcontroller revenue including the automotive and industrial touch microcontrollers will be reported as part of Microchip's microcontroller product line. Atmel's analog revenue, which is predominantly made up of products for the automotive market will be reported as part of Microchip's analog product line. Atmel's memory revenue will be reported as part of Microchip's memory product line. Atmel had a product line called multi-market, which included the aerospace business, the legacy CPLD business, and their foundry services business. Microchip will adopt multi-market as a product line we report and we'll roll the revenue from our historical other product line, which consisted of manufacturing services, into this multi-market product line. Further, Atmel also has some legacy ASIC microcontrollers comprising either discontinued products, or products which had not had any investment for many years. We intend to include revenue from these products in the multi-market product line as well. As we mentioned during our April 4 conference call, Atmel's Mobile Touch business will be classified as an asset held for sale and we will only report the net profit or loss for this business below the operating line of Microchip's income statement. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward, and some more about the Atmel integration. Steve?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Ganesh and good afternoon everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and the newly acquired Atmel. Our March quarter financial results were very strong amidst a weak semiconductor industry backdrop. We achieved the high end of our net sales guidance, establishing a new record in the process, and we exceeded the high end of the guidance for non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage, and earnings per share. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was sequentially up approximately 11% from the December quarter due to improving sales, gross margin, and operating expense leverage. I hope that emphatically demonstrates the operating leverage left in our premium business model. Before I go into guidance, let me give you a brief update on the integration of Micrel and Atmel. On Micrel, we are essentially in the final stages of completing the integration. The two items remaining are both in the manufacturing area. The integration of backend operations into Microchip Systems is on schedule for August. The other item is the closing of the fab, and we have an update on that. We could have closed Micrel fab in August by building a large amount of inventory for the customers to switch to Microchip's 8-inch fabs. But as we have analyzed options after the Atmel purchase, we believe that a couple of processes are better transferred from the Micrel 6-inch fab to Atmel's 6-inch fab in Colorado Springs. This will require less inventory and result in lower risk to the customers and business units. Therefore, we are transferring the process to Atmel's fab, and we will structure the Micrel fab to a very small operation largely running a couple of those processes until they are qualified in the Atmel fab. We believe this will delay the final close of the Micrel fab by four months to December of 2016. The financial model of Micrel is starting to look very good. Recall that when we purchased Micrel about nine months ago, it was making a gross margin of 48.4% and the operating profit was 6.7% of revenue. In the December 2015 quarter, we achieved 49.5% gross margin and 18% operating profit from Micrel. I'm happy to report that in the March 2016 quarter, we achieved 53.2% gross margin and 22.8% operating profit from Micrel. We now believe that after we close the fab, the final operating profit model for Micrel will exceed 30% and will be above our original model. By the way, Supertex integration is complete. Final result: gross margin in the high 60s, and the operating expenses are really intertwined, so harder to decipher. But safe to say that the operating profit is in the 30s. Now, regarding Atmel, Ganesh provided the progress report on the integration of product lines of Atmel. There's not a whole lot more beyond that with just one month gone. We're in the process of cross-franchising Microchip and Atmel distributors, and we're sorting through all the overlaps in rep coverage in major accounts. I will now provide guidance for the June 2016 quarter. We started out June quarter with a stronger backlog than we had going into January, and the bookings and turns for the quarter so far have been strong. The Chinese New Year holidays in Asia are also behind us, although this is traditionally a slower quarter in Europe. Based on our analysis of economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as our own business indicators, we are guiding the March quarter net sales without Atmel to be up between 1% to 5% sequentially or between $574.1 million and $596.9 million. We expect the non-GAAP gross margin, again without Atmel, to be between 58.2% and 58.6% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 26.3% and 26.6% of sales. And we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 31.6% and 32.3% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share without Atmel to be $0.70 to $0.74 per share. With this, let me now provide guidance for attrition from the acquisition of Atmel. There are two items that we need to be mindful of as we look at guidance for Atmel's net sales. First, while Atmel reported its net sales based on sell-in revenue recognition to distributors in Asia, Microchip will report Atmel's non-GAAP sales based on a sell-through revenue recognition worldwide. Secondly, Microchip will report the Mobile Touch portion of Atmel's business as an asset held for sale and will report this business unit's profit or loss below the net operating profit of Microchip and will exclude this net profit or loss for non-GAAP purposes. Now, based on that, we expect Atmel to add approximately $225 million to $245 million in net sales for the continued businesses. We expect the continuing business of Atmel to be between 46% to 47% in gross margin, and we expect the Atmel subsidiary to be between 0 to $0.05 accretive to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings per share. So now, let's combine the guidance for core Microchip and Atmel. We expect June quarter net sales to be between $799.1 million and $841.9 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.70 to $0.79 per share. We continue to expect that Atmel will be about $0.25 accretive to Microchips non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal year 2017. In closing, I would like to say that March quarter marks the start of the growth period for us after ending the inventory correction in the December quarter. In case of Atmel, the inventory on the balance sheet and the distribution inventory is still high and there is still some inventory correction to go through that is baked into our guidance. Combining growth from our core business, further accretion coming from Micrel, and the accretion from Atmel, this triple effect will set up the earnings growth momentum that we expect will lead us to an 18% non-GAAP EPS growth from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: Yes, sir. Thank you. And we first move to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. Thank you for allowing me to ask question. This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. On the Atmel business, can you talk about the growth in the various segments that you have analyzed after you acquired? Which are the segments you think is going to grow and how do you think you're going to position your products along with their products and strategically grow both product lines?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: It's a little early for all the growth areas. Obviously we're coming up to speed in the different businesses. The investment roadmaps have been what they were. They were focused on 32-bit in touch alone. There wasn't as much on 8-bit. We see that as a potential area of growth for us going forward. There is some growth we believe in security, certainly in the microcontroller – 32-bit microcontroller and wireless areas that they have invested in. It's a little early to give you any specific numbers. We're working on that. We also have to look at how to balance that with investments Microchip has also been making in similar areas. So that's with respect to growth. On the positioning, I think we've very clear ways in, which products have areas of strength that they have developed. On 8-bit the AVR has a strong following a wide base of customers and applications, and so does the PIC microcontrollers. The biggest opportunity on that is going to be how do we take our analog products and create more attach around both company's efforts? Obviously we've been doing that on 8-bit for a long time now doing it for the AVR 8-bit as well. On 32-bit, microprocessors is an area that Atmel had as a strength. We hadn't been doing it. We will take that and run with it, and again, position the rest of our product lines to attach with their microprocessors. We expect on the microcontrollers that are ARM based as well as MIPS-based microcontrollers that will have PIC 32 and SAM 32 products. They each have different uniqueness around them have gone after slightly different markets. In some cases there could be commonality of customers. And so largely, on the microcontrollers, we're not expecting that these big shakeups in the roadmap. And then outside of microcontrollers really the rest of the product lines are reasonably well positioned.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Just as a follow-up on the synergies from Atmel acquisition could you provide a split-up between how much will come from the COGS side things and OpEx side of things for fiscal 2017 and then maybe in out years will that incrementally be more on the COGS side or the OpEx side?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We are not able to break down the synergies in OpEx or the COGS side or revenue growth. We've given combined numbers of the earnings per share accretion for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 and you know a month after the acquisition as we've looked at it we're pretty much confirming that we can achieve those numbers.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. Just a question on kind of the IoT piece of business, Steve. If you can just touch on you know how you're seeing design activity there and the relative growth of those type of products versus the overall MCU business?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, our wireless business has been doing quite well for quite some time. And honestly, we're surprised about where Atmel got some of the reputation on being well positioned in IoT. As we looked at it now closer as we own it, the wireless business was less than half of Microchip's business and losing a very large amount of money. So we are dramatically restructuring Atmel's wireless business, combining with our wireless business, and coming up with a combined roadmap – some products from us, some products from them. In fact, just today we closed one of the design centers of their wireless, which was based in Dresden, Germany. But Microchip had a very strong momentum on wireless, and taking some of the good products from Atmel, it will further aid to it. But their wireless business wasn't really cracked up to really what they positioned it with the analysts and investors.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just as my follow-up for a comment on just the current environment. As you mentioned, this is a sort of growth period for you. Any anecdotes you can kind of point you in terms of as you made your way through the inventory correction, whether it's customer behavior or distributors, and how the business is being managed?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Are you talking about Microchip's core business or Atmel's business?
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Microchip's core.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So our business is running normal. We completed the inventory correction back in December quarter. As we reported, the distribution inventory was basically flattish. It was down by two days last quarter. Our internal inventory seems reasonable. So I don't really think there's movement going in either direction. I think the business is really normal. Our business represents the real demand today.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question, and thanks for all the detail of the conference call. Steve, I guess my first question is if I adjust for the Mobile Touch business at Atmel, it looks like the June guide is sort of implying flat to down kind of 8%, maybe like down 4% at the midpoint. I'm just kind of curious to what extent do you think this is just a hangover of some of the distribution inventory problems you had versus maybe a portfolio that wasn't as strong as you had originally thought? And I guess, importantly, when do you think you get the core Atmel business back to some level of sequential and year-over-year growth?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So, there were probably more than one question in there, but the Mobile Touch business of Atmel that we didn't include is about $14 million a quarter. So if you add it to the midpoint of our guidance that we provided, it's about $250 million. So it's really neither way up or down much. We basically feel that Atmel was in the middle of a very major inventory correction. There was a very, very large amount of distribution inventory as well as the inside inventory. We have seen some of that behavior with sell-in driven companies in our prior acquisitions also, but this one was really over the top. As we announced back on April 4, that – based on a sell-in driven revenue recognition, the revenue was only in the $220 million range. So there was really a massive inventory correction in distribution. If they were standalone then the revenue would just have been very, very low. And I think the second part of your question was when do we see growth. We believe we see stabilization beginning now, and it continuously improves. We are improving Atmel's systems on many different fronts, and you'll see the second half of this year to be significantly better than what you've seen in the first half.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's all for Steve. And maybe for my follow-up I know this doesn't impact the non-GAAP guidance you gave, but when you report sort of the below-the-line loss or gain from the Mobile Touch business, did you expect that business to be profitable? Is it a loss? And how we think about getting rid of that business relative to your accretion targets for Atmel?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So the business is about $14 million in revenue, low-30s gross margin, and 33% range kind of gross margin, and it's losing money. And part of the issue is its expenses are extremely high and kept high by Atmel management, while the revenue was falling steeply down over the last year and the year before. So what we are doing is very, very aggressively cutting its operating expenses to size the business accordingly to get it close to profitability. And with that, we will market that business to be able to sell it.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon and nice job on the quarterly execution. Your 16-bit and 32-bit businesses grew double digits sequentially in March. It's pretty solid results in a tough demand environment. I know you say broad-based, but any color, geography or end market-wise, as to the strong growth drivers? I know automotive continues to be an area of strength, but any color you can provide will be appreciated here.
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: There's nothing I can point my finger to and say this is what it was. Both businesses are like our overall microcontroller business. They are broad-based, thousands of customers, many, many, many different applications. And that work takes place over the years to establish those new designs. And as any overall improvement environment happens, we see that improvement in our business across a wide range of applications and customers. So nothing specific I can point to.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks for that. And then I know the team had previously mentioned that China did not fall off a cliff in the March quarter. It's maybe the market (37:02). Is the team expecting the core Microchip China business to grow in the June quarter? Again auto in China appears to be an area of strength. I know you've got broad-based exposure here, but again, any areas in China that you're seeing strength? Is it more just inventory replenishment or do you think that is true demand pull?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, yes, absolutely. Our June quarter business in China will be up sequentially over the March quarter. We were not able to break down by industry because we just don't roll up the revenue that way. It's broad-based. We are up in direct. We are up in distribution, so it's really fairly broad-based. Our China business will definitely be up in the March quarter.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: It's really always up in June following the Chinese New Year funk that happened in the March quarter. So it's just a higher number of shipping days, but the demand environment is fine.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for the insights.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Welcome.
Operator: Next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the nice job in the quarter. Steve, I wanted to start off with a higher-level question. The team has had four weeks to be on the inside of the Atmel business. Could you summarize for us what your biggest takeaways are now that you're on the inside looking at that business versus what you thought you were getting when you closed the deal a month ago?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: That's a thoughtful question and probably requires a thoughtful answer. I think if you take it from the high level, in consolidation of any industry, there are companies at the bottom that have been underperforming for years. They are being forced by either their boards or the activists investors to seek strategic alternatives, which is another word for basically selling the company. Such consolidation is now taking place in the semiconductor industry, and we have been kind of one of the consolidators. Microchip has purchased a number of companies that were all underperforming, and in each of these companies we found some negative surprises after we bought the companies. But Microchip has systematically transformed the companies that we have bought into highly profitable enterprises performing in the Microchip business model. I've given you examples of SMSC, Micrel, and Supertex before. And we believe that we'll be able to do the same with Atmel. We have competed Atmel for years. What we knew of Atmel from outside was that they have very good products and technology. And a month after we have purchased them we've confirmed that many of Atmel's product and technologies are good, and they fit very well with Microchip's products, technologies, and our roadmaps. But at the same time, we always wondered why Atmel, with such good products and technologies, always underperformed and could not make even a third of the profit that Microchip made. We now have a deeper understanding of that. And the easiest way to describe that is they were very poorly managed. I will put that in five main buckets. First, very poor accountability for results. I mean, kept giving bonuses and raises or whatever, irrespective of the performance of the company. So very poor accountability for results. Number second, poor teamwork. As we have seen, teamwork between sales and operations and planning and inventory and just everybody does what they need to do, and very poor teamwork. Number three, very high spending culture. Obviously, operating expenses in excess of 40% of revenue. Number four, always swinging for homeruns and essentially getting struck out, versus Microchip building its businesses with singles and doubles. And finally, number five, very poor pricing discipline. So I think those are the five areas we've diagnosed. Again, poor accountability for results, poor teamwork, very high spending culture, swinging for fences for the homeruns, and very, very poor pricing discipline. So we have now combined most of Atmel's business units under Microchip leaders so that we can begin to teach and implement our system of teamwork, accountability, operating expense, discipline, broad customer base, and strong pricing discipline. As we have done with SMSC, Supertex, and Micrel, we'll be sharing that progress with the investors and analyst in the coming quarters. Atmel is not the first company and that I've been stressed over after purchasing them, but I'm confident that just like in other cases investors will like the results we deliver as we transform Atmel's good products and technologies to yield kind of Microchip kind of financial performance. So that's kind of how I see it.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thank for that detail. The follow-up question is one related to prepared comments, and it deals with integration, some of the operational aspects of the new business, and it's in regards to the distribution channels and the sales teams. How long does it take to do a full cross selling training on each of the portfolios with the different channels and when do you expect to start to get the design win synergy off of that cross training?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I would say it takes about three months to launch it, another six months to train it, and you start getting design wins in the second half, probably, after six, seven months. And then remember, production is another year, year and half, away at some earlier wins on analog and attach and places where the time to revenue could be shorter.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks, and the last question is for Ganesh. Ganesh, I appreciate the careful walk through the product groups and the way Atmel is integrating with Microchip. I didn't hear you mention the 16-bit business. Where does that fit as the portfolios come together under either standalone leadership or leadership with one of the groups you did mention?
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: Okay. So, that's easy. There was no 16-bit business at Atmel. Microchip's 16-bit business continues as a standalone business.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys.
Operator: And we next move to Chris Danely with Citigroup.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, thanks, Steve. I was going to ask a lot of questions but your response to the last prompted to me ask this one. So with Atmel's culture being pretty screwed up, A, have you had an acquired company that's been this bad? And, B, if you could share any anecdotes, and then perhaps talk to us about how long you think it will take get things in line there?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think I kind of have been on record that this is probably the worst performing company I bought, and the size and scale of it kind of makes it that much more challenging. But we've a deep experience inside of Microchip. The people we have prepared and battle-hardened to do these integrations over many, many different acquisitions. Remember, we have done acquisition in memory, which was SST. We've done acquisitions in wireless before. We have done acquisitions in logic businesses like SMSC. We have acquired manufacturing assets before where we bought one of the test plant MMT. We bought a fab plant in Oregon. So across our diverse management structure, we have deep expertise in integrating acquired companies across many, many disciplines. And the entire – that trained and battle-hardened management team of Microchip is really at work at Atmel where essentially all but one or so of the divisions are today – business units are being led by a Microchip executive, and we're basically making the operational changes, the cultural changes, the teamwork changes. We have set up meetings already where operations and business units are in a common meeting, figuring out what the demand is, what we should build. Those things were not connected. Basically, business units throw a demand over the wall and the manufacturing group will invent and build it, and sales never booked that order and never won that design, and there are lots and lots of millions or parts sitting written off. And there was a very, very high amount of inventory write-off at Atmel when we look at the history of that. And it doesn't compare anything with Microchip where we are really well run, and rare that you have any kind of large inventory write-off. So we're implementing all of Microchip's processes, and as we implement Microchip's processes, then lot of the gross margin and other improvement will just happen because you don't write off the inventory, there's a better pricing discipline, there's less OpEx, and people are working together, all that kind of stuff.
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: Chris, I will also add there are lots and lots of great employees at Atmel, so, many of whom were yearning for an improvement in system and who are responding extremely well to our presence, our values. And so – we've seen this in other companies as well, that once you go below the top level, there are lots and lots of excellent employees who will be a big part of the contribution as we bring in the improvements that we need to make. And we already see lots of those people are thrilled to be liberated and to be able to thrive in the systems that we bring.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We always say that management works on the system and employees work in the system. So employees work in a system with very little accountability and they were not empowered to really make, maybe possibly, the improvements that they could have made. And system was very top-down; there was too much bureaucracy in the system. As we have traveled to all the Atmel sites internationally, in places, that team has constantly come that there was so much central command and control from the headquarter where it took levels and levels of approvals and just there was a constipation of the funnel, essentially, where nothing got approved and nothing got done. And ours is a very distributed intelligence and distributed decision-making, and people empowered, where they work by our values. They know what they need to do, And so lots of people as we've travelled from Norway to France to Germany to Colorado Springs to other have really embraced us and said this is the kind of culture they have been yearning for.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Next question comes from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations as well. This is a question with respect to Atmel's growth rate, and I think you touched upon it a little bit. But just want to get some more clarity. If you look at Atmel's revenue in 2015, it declined about 17% year-on-year, roughly. Now, there were a lot of one-time items that were contributing to that fall you've calculated. But I wanted to get a sense of kind of how you're looking at Atmel's three-year or long-term growth rate, putting aside some of the one-time events that occurred in 2015 and given the fact that two thirds of Atmel's revenue is really microcontrollers and your strategy of really kind of focusing on the two-thirds of the business. How do we look at kind of Atmel's longer-term growth rate?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think any answer we give either would mean nothing, or you won't believe it. So one month after this, when I'm ready to talk about what happens to Atmel's revenue three years from now? What we're seeing is that there was a very, very large shipments into distribution where distribution inventory was out of sight and when you then measure revenue by selling the revenue had a steep fall off in the later quarters, which is what you're counting in a significant revenue drop of Atmel in 2015, and I'm not disagreeing that the revenue was down 17%, 17.5%. From the number that we're guiding you today we see this number to be the starting point of stabilization in Atmel's revenue. There is some more distribution inventory correction to go through, so the second half of this year should be stronger than the first half. Now, beyond that, with the better execution, combined roadmap, the good pricing discipline, great distribution methodology, our cross-selling distributor on each of those products, analog attach, and others, we need to produce a growth rate from Atmel which is at least as much as the industry. I don't think that will be that difficult from how atrophied it is. And we've seen that in our other acquisitions. Beyond that I can't really add the numbers to it.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Well, that's helpful, at least in terms of the thought process. Just following up, again, the microcontroller business is – put aside the changes in the revenue recognition – is roughly two-thirds of the Atmel's business. And then you have obviously the non-volume memory, RF auto, and multi-market....
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So it's not true that we're only focusing on the microcontroller business. We have two of our general managers focusing on the microcontroller business, one of 8-bit and one on the 32-bit. But we have another one focused on wireless. We have another one focused on the RF automotive business. We have another one focused on security. We have another one trying to combine the memory businesses of both the companies and they have some good memory products and we think we could do more and better with them. So I can't afford to ignore one-third of any business and....
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: No. I understand it. I'm just doing the math in terms of sensitivity. Every 250 basis points change in the microcontroller business has 180 basis point impact on revenue growth. And as you do – the same number, in terms of the one-third of the business only have 80 basis points. So that's what I'm just trying to get a sense of your thought process there?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. So the business has been declining so far with the March quarter as the bottom. And what we're trying to do is first to stabilize it here, recover from the distribution inventory issue in the second half, grow some, and then lots of good design wins are in the works.
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: The products and technologies are fundamentally good. and so we believe that a good foundation from which to begin the efforts needed to grow the business. There's every confidence that as we take those products, apply some of the disciplines that Steve talked, about get them into a combined channel, there's no doubt in my mind we'll find ways to grow that business.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to talk about the CapEx, your plans. It seems it's extremely low as a percentage of revenue. Is that just good timing or you expect that to expand in coming years or – and what is the CapEx (54:26)
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I guess I'd say we have the factory footprint that we need and we'll make incremental investments in the business as required. You'll probably recall that for Microchip's core business that we've pretty high CapEx in the first two quarters of last fiscal year, and with that we put some capacity in place that really isn't being utilized today. So we've got some capacity to grow into on that front. We still have a lot of work to do in determining how backend integration is going to work for Atmel. We've got some placeholders for that, but we think a $140 million is a good placeholder for the current fiscal year, and as we learn more about future investment needs we can update you on that.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And Atmel revenue is down much more substantially. I mean our revenue is close to – it was record last quarter, but Atmel's revenue is down significantly from its higher numbers before. Earlier caller mentioned that 17% drop last year. So there is substantial space in their factories. So therefore, I think the capital investment should be relatively limited for growing the revenue going forward.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping I could better understand some of the dynamics around the Atmel revenue. And there was some discussion in some of the online publications around some of the larger customers potentially taking business away from Atmel post merger. And I was hoping you could clarify if any of the decline in Atmel's revenue is some of these larger customers may be taking business elsewhere.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So I think I mentioned that Atmel had a very, very poor pricing discipline. So we have found businesses in Atmel, particular line items to particular customers, that were at negative gross margins where you're wrapping money around every part that you're shipping, and some of that happening even on non-commodity products, even microcontrollers. I mean, why would you do that? So I think as we try to correct those things – I put the brand in three different categories, three different positioning, and let me take that angle from a marketing standpoint. A company has a brand position which is really what do the customers think of the company. Then a company has a product position, positioning where – what does the customer think of the company's products. And then the third, a company has a pricing position where what do the customers think of the value the company provides to the customers on its products. So positioning is important three different ways: brand positioning, product positioning, and pricing positioning. When I look at Microchip, I find us very strong in all three. We have a good brand reputation, we have a good product positioning, and we have good pricing positioning where we're able to draw very, very good pricing by customers seeing the value in our products. That's how we make near 60% gross margin. When I apply the same principles to Atmel, I find they have a good product positioning. And Ganesh and I mentioned that we find good products. The company probably has just an okay brand position as a company but it has a very poor pricing positioning, where it hasn't positioned its products to be able to show the value to the customer. And they sell them like...
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: Jellybeans.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Like jellybeans. So as Microchip starts to put the discipline in place and there are common customers where we do business with and they're same customers that Atmel does business with – and you've read something in paper where some ex-executives blabbering about and being pissed off or whatever because they no longer have a job or there cheese has been moved. But all these customers are doing business with Microchip. And they're doing business with Microchip. We're able to position our products at a much higher value, and we have substantially higher gross margin at the same customers where Atmel has a very poor gross margin.
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: So, we had no large customers that are designing out because of this in any way.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Ganesh Moorthy - President & Chief Operating Officer: If anything, it's a converse. We have more conversations with large customers recognizing that the combined companies, Microchip and Atmel, to them represent a much more strategic supplier to them and wanting to have more discussions in that direction.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Then on the top of that the sales force is commissioned. Atmel's sales force is commissioned. Microchip is not. And we have had conversations with sales people where we say, this is a negative gross margin business. Why do you do that? Well, I'm making commission on it. You can't take it away. So as you start to interrupt that environment and start to change that culture, you will get reaction from those people. And then somebody talks to the press. That's what you have read. We are doing what our investors would want us to do, is to have three better positioning, brand, products, and pricing.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: This is very helpful. And there's a couple of just very quick clarifications around Atmel. Could you clarify what sell-in revenue is next quarter? I think the $225 million to $245 million is sell-through. And then one other clarification, I think you mentioned $14 million is excluded from revenue from Atmel around the Mobile Touch. And I thought last quarter it was maybe $6 million to $7 million. And maybe just help me reconcile those two figures. Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So $6 million to $7 million is based on sell-in and the inventory was very, very high. The sell-thorough was $14 million, or around $14 million. So that's the difference on your second question. Regarding what is the sell-in revenue this quarter, we don't care. We really don't care. We are not going to stop the channel. We are not going to make any deals; that's another thing Atmel did. They basically made deals at the end of the quarter at lower prices and make deals with the distribution to give whatever so that – given revenue could be reported. We do not care about the sell-in. We never cared about sell-in on the Microchip side. We are going to work with the distributors to create demand and sell business to end customers at better prices and whatever distributors want to stock, we don't care about sell-in.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Welcome.
Operator: Next question comes from Gil Alexandre with Darfil Associates (01:01:31).
Unknown Speaker: My question has been answered. Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for taking my question. The first one is a clarification I think. If I wanted to compare like apples-to-apples on revenues going forward, the Touch business comes out of the top line. Did you say this 32-bit PIC business comes out of the top line and the Atmel Wireless comes out of the top line going forward? And then aggregate about – could you share with us what that was in the previous quarter?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Mark, I don't know how you got all that. The only thing that comes out of the top line is the mobile piece of the Touch business. We're dividing the Touch business into two portions, the automotive and industrial on one side, which we're keeping, and the Mobile Touch on the other side, which we're not keeping, which last quarter was $7 million on sell-in, about $14 million on sell-through. That's the only thing that's coming out. Nothing else is coming from the top line. I don't know how you got wireless.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: So the PIC microprocessor that Ganesh mentioned earlier, that was a project that was in development at Microchip. That was not producing revenue.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Okay.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, so it was a brand-new initiative at Microchip. In addition to our 32-bit PIC microcontroller line we were going to develop a PIC microprocessor line, which is with their higher end cores, they don't have Flash, it goes in a different market, they use Linux operating systems. It was a very, very large investment, and Atmel has already made that investment and had significant revenue on it. So we're not going to make those investments on our sides. But there was zero revenue. There was not even a revenue on it in the next year. And then nothing comes out of the wireless. Atmel ran a very, very small wireless business out of seven different design centers and we closed one of them, which was in Germany, in a very high cost region.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Okay, that's helpful.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And we continue to sell those products and market those products. There was a very small revenue coming out of that center. So there's nothing else; it's only the Mobile Touch.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Understood that. Thanks for clarifying. And then I imagine there will be a restructuring charge in the June quarter. Is there a way to estimate that or give us a sense to how big that might be?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We don't have it. We are not giving to give you a number and then want to be limited in any way to really live to that number. So restructuring charge will be whatever it will be.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: And with no further questions in queue, I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management for closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. We thank everyone for attending the call and asking some nice questions. We'll see some of you on the road. There are some conferences coming up. I'll personally be at the JPMorgan conference in Boston, and Eric, you will be...
J. Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: So we're going to have to revisit the schedule but we're at another conference in early June.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: With that, thank you very much.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great rest of your day.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-02-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chairman and CEO, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, and good afternoon everyone, and welcome to our fiscal third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I would like to begin by saying how proud and pleased I am to be promoting Ganesh Moorthy to President and Chief Operating Officer. I am not going anywhere, and I will remain as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. I will say more about it later in my comments, and let me know first pass this call to Eric Bjornholt who will walk you through our financial results. Eric?
Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Micrel acquisition, and provide some additional commentary on our announced acquisition of Atmel. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the December quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance at $552 million, and were down 1.3% sequentially from net sales of $559.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $11.7 million higher than GAAP net sales, as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and when distributor contracts are changed to the standard Microchip format compared to the sell and revenue recognition contracts that Micrel previously had for certain of those distribution partners. We posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.9% in the December quarter and at the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.5% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range, and non-GAAP operating income was 29.5% of sales, which was above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $138.4 million resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.64 which was higher than our pre-announced results from January 19. On a GAAP basis, net sales were $540.3 million, and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisitions and related expenses were 54.2% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.3 million of share-based compensation, $6.9 million of gross margin impacts from the distributor revenue adjustment I mentioned earlier, and $17.8 million in acquired inventory evaluation cost and acquisition related restructuring cost. Total operating expenses were $216.6 million or 40.1% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $48.3 million, share-based compensation of $14.7 million, $1.5 million of acquisition related expenses, and special income of $5 million. GAAP net income was $61.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share. In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10% and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 22%. The non-GAAP tax rate reflects the benefit in the December quarter for the R&D tax credit reinstatement but we are including the benefit from R&D tax credit from previous quarters that were reinstated only in the GAAP results to make future periods more comparable. We expect our longer term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11%. Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory at December 31, 2015 was $319.5 million and includes $11 million of fair value markup on Micrel's inventory required by GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 120 days of inventory at December 31, 2015, which is up by five days from the levels at the end of the September quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 34 days, which is down one day from the September quarter levels. I want to remind you that historically Microchip's distribution revenue throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis. Micrel has some distributors that historically recognize revenue on a sell-in basis. Microchip changed substantially all of the contractual relationships with these distributors during the December quarter which has resulted in sell-through revenue recognition in the future. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Micrel distributors for the entire March quarter in order to continue to provide investors with a view of the true end-market demand for our products. There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition as the inventory in the distribution channel at the date of the conversion to sell-through accounting will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes. The cash generation in the December quarter excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment, and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was $172 million. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.398 billion, our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at December 31 were $1.008 billion, $288 million lower than it was on September 30 as we paid down a portion of the revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the March quarter. Capital spending was approximately $17.9 million in the December quarter. We expect about $28 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $110 million, well below our previous guidance to the street of $125 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies, and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $26.7 million. Over the past several years, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders has been treated as return of capital as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. As indicated in last quarter's earnings call, due to the integration of Micrel into Microchip global tax structure, Microchip will have earnings and profits in the United States in fiscal year 2016. For this transaction Microchip brought back about $250 million of offshore cash to the U.S. and we don't anticipate paying in the U.S. cash taxes on the amount as we will use net operating losses to offset the income. As a result, a portion of Microchip's calendar year 2015 dividends are taxable to shareholders versus the return of capital treatment from the last few years. We have posted a copy of the IRS Form 8937 on the Investor Relations page of our website which indicates the split between taxable dividends and return of capital for each dividend payment made during calendar year 2015. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I start my prepared remarks, I'd like to take a moment to thank Steve, our Board of Directors, the Microchip Executive Team, and the over 10,000 employees of Microchip worldwide for the high honor and the distinct privilege they have bestowed on me to be the next President of Microchip. It has been the journey of a lifetime to have witnessed and contributed to the growth and success of Microchip, and I look forward to continuing that journey with the Microchip team as we scale new heights and achieve new business milestones in the years to come. Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our products lines starting with Microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was down 3.5% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter as we experienced the same broad-based weakness that the industry experienced. In calendar year 2015 our microcontroller business was down 1.4% as compared to calendar year 2014, and while we're not happy about the decline we are confident that we're gaining market share in every microcontroller segment that we compete in what was a difficult year for the overall industry. The official microcontroller rankings, we expect will be available in time for our next earnings conference call. We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers, as well as software and development tool solutions to compliment them which we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. As we mentioned at our January 19 conference call, the addition of Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller family and 32-bit ARM microcontrollers family we expect will enhance Microchip's industry leading 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller offerings. Microcontrollers represented 58.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. Moving to Analog, our Analog business which includes Micrel results was up 4.1% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter, and was up 3.6% compared to the year ago quarter. In calendar year 2015, our analog business was up 22.4% as compared to calendar year 2014. The strong growth and increase in market share in 2015 was the result of our organic growth efforts, as well as the Micrel acquisition. Our analog business represented 31.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter, the highest percentage of our total revenue it has ever been. To put the size of our analog business in perspective, in the December quarter Microchip's analog business alone was almost the same size as all of Microchip was in the March quarter of 2009, and at an almost $700 million annual revenue run rate it is emerging as one of the larger analog franchises serving the embedded controlled market. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business, complemented by the products added to our portfolio through acquisitions. Now moving to the Memory business, our memory business which is comprised of our Serial E-Squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash memory products was down 8.3% in the December quarter, as compared to the September quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business, and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, including comments on the progress of integration for Micrel. Then I will provide some further commentary on some of the feedback we have received since the conference call about acquisition of Atmel. Our December quarter results were strong amidst a very turbulent macro and semiconductor industry backdrop. The quarterly results in non-GAAP revenue, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage and operating profit percentage were all better than the midpoint of our guidance. Additionally, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $0.64 which is above the $0.62 to $0.63 upwardly revised guidance we provided in the announcement of our preliminary results on January 19, 2016. I will now provide guidance for the March 2016 quarter. We believe that our business has stabilized and that the majority of the inventory correction is behind us. The March quarter is impacted negatively by the Chinese New Year holidays in Asia but it is also the strongest quarter of the year for Microchip in Europe. Based on our analysis of economic and semiconductor industry conditions, as well as our own business indicators, we are guiding the March quarter non-GAAP net sales to be between flat to up 3% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.9% and 58.1% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 27.3% and 27.9% of sales. And we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 30% and 30.8% of sales. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.65 to $0.69 per share. Now let me provide you with an update on the integration of Micrel. The integration continues to progress as planned, there were seven main elements of integration we had defined. Five of them are complete which are; number one, financial and business systems consolidation; number two, consolidation of Micrel's wafer fab starts planning; number three, integration of salesforce rep and distribution network; number four, integration of products lines and R&D activities; and number five, integration of human resources systems, equity plans, 401K, medical benefits, bonus plans etcetera. The remaining two areas which are progressing well but are not complete yet are; number one, the closure of Micrel San Jose fab which is on-schedule for August 2016; and number two, the integration of backend operational systems which also remains on-schedule for August of 2016. With this let me know provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. Micrel acquisition was about $0.07 accretive in the September quarter and was $0.038 accretive in the December quarter to non-GAAP EPS. This accretion will continue to increase and we now believe that we will achieve $0.30 of EPS accretion run rate from Micrel by the end of fiscal year 2017. This is up from $0.25 accretion target that we provided in the prior conference calls. These numbers depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the help of the underlying economy in general. Now some update about Atmel. I have visited Atmel's headquarter location in San Jose, and fab location in Colorado Springs and held all employee communication meetings and one meetings with the executive. Ganesh and I are headed to Europe in mid-February to visit Atmel's European locations in France, Germany, Norway and UK. We completed the U.S. Antitrust Filing last week and the filings in Germany and Korea are scheduled for next week. We are also targeting the F4 filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission in about a week. We continue to expect to close this transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2016. Since the announcement of the Atmel transaction and our conference call on January 19, most of the feedback from investors and analysts has been very positive that the deal makes sense. However, there are also areas where either we were not sufficiently clear or investors have further questions. We would like to provide more clarification regarding these concerns today. The general view that we have heard is that the current slow growth environment, that in the current slow growth environment investors like the self-help stories that can continue to generate growth despite the challenging macro environment. We have recently shared with investors Microchip's organic and total growth in the last six years to repeat just under metric from calendar 2009 to calendar year 2015, Microchip's organic compounded annual growth rate has been 8.3% per year and the total compounded annual growth including acquisitions has been 17.3% per year. Investors have commented that our management team has the best chance of turning around Atmel and making them successful. Now let us go into some of the concerns that investors and analysts have raised. First is leverage. Investors have raised a concern that the Atmel acquisition increases Microchip's debt-to-EBITDA leverage quite a bit and understandably have questions about the cash quotient and potential risk to the dividend. We have said in the conference call that after the stock buyback, our senior debt-to-EBITDA leverage will be 2.7 and our total leverage will be 4.5. We would like to point out that these numbers are before synergy. Once you factor in synergies, consistent with what companies like NXP and Avago have done in their coated leverage numbers, we expect our debt-to-EBITDA leverage to drop rapidly as follows. After the first year the senior leverage will drop from 2.7 to 2.3, and the total leverage will drop from 4.5 to 4. After two years the senior leverage drops to 1.9 and the total leverage drops to 3.4. And after three years the senior leverage will drop to 1.7 and the total leverage will drop to 3.1. As you can see -- as you can clearly see our debt-to-EBITDA leverage drops rapidly over the first three years after the close of the Atmel acquisition. Additionally, Microchip's management and the Board is fully committed to the dividend and does not see any risk to the dividend. The second question that has been raised is multiple architectures. We received this question at the last conference call also but we have continued to receive follow-on question about this. The comment from investors has been that Microchip in the past has been dismissive of the ARM architecture, so what has changed now? When Microchip was dismissive of the ARM architecture it was in response to investors question about replacing our PIC32 architecture which is MIPS based. In that regard, nothing has changed. We continue to hear from distributors and our customers that ARM has commoditized this market and Microchip's PIC32 based solutions are differentiated in superior products in the marketplace. Therefore, Microchip has no plans to shell one or the other architecture. We will be the only company that will have ARM architecture when the customer demands an ARM solution, and we will have PIC32 when we can sell a differentiated solution like we have been doing for several years. By the way, Atmel does not consider its ARM based products to be a commodity, nor do any of the other suppliers who are also trying to differentiate their products using different peripherals. This is consistent with what we have been saying for years that it is not about the core, it's about the total solution. Atmel's ARM32 based products and Microchip's PIC32 products are both successful in their own right, and we believe have strong ecosystems and market momentum to continue to be successful. As far as AVR and PIC are concerned, at the 8-bit architecture level these are both very mature solutions with fully developed product portfolios, development tools and ecosystems, and they can continue to coexist. There are PIC head engineers who like PICs and there are AVR freaks, a group on the web who like AVR. We cannot disappoint either and will continue to support both of these groups. But as we mentioned during our conference call, we do expect to find synergies by not having to duplicate the investment in IP building blocks that make up our microcontrollers. We believe that the investors are making the same mistakes that they made when they believed that SMSC's vertical products lines and automotive and personal computer business was an issue for us because we were based on horizontal market and sales. Investors have routinely underestimated Microchip's management's ability to transform the company's organization and resources to take on the challenge at hand. The third question raised has been revenue dis-synergies. Investors believe that not all of Atmel's products lines will meet Microchip's margin criteria and some segments will be exited or divested. Investors have pointed to our attempt to purchase Atmel in 2008 when we were going to divest a couple of segments to ON Semiconductors. While in 2008 Microchip was planning to sell the memory business and automotive business to ON Semiconductor, I must point out that while the memory business was a lower margin business for Atmel at that time, the primary reason for Microchip to divest those two businesses was affordability, not the margin. ON Semiconductor was going to bring $1 billion of cash into the deal. Without that Microchip could not afford to buy Atmel at the size Microchip was then. Since then Microchip has grown tremendously, and with a large market capitalization. Today we can afford the entire Atmel business ourselves. Secondly, Atmel has divested many of the low margins businesses, namely Smart Card, CDL Flash Memory business and some others. Today we see only 5% of Atmel business that is in mobile consumer electronics touch segment that is very low gross margin. We believe that there are significant positive synergies in this acquisition to easily override any potential negative synergy out of that 5% business which has declined very significantly already under Atmel's clock. Fourth question raised has been dis-synergy through multi-sourcing. There seems to be a misconception that both Microchip and Atmel microcontrollers are designed into the same circuit and therefore there will be some dis-synergy. We do not understand this concern due to different architectures Microchip and Atmel microcontrollers are never designed into the same circuit. There is also a concern that distributors will not sell a broad portfolio, we don't understand that either. If that line of thinking was to be true, then distributors should give all of Texas instruments business to me as they have a much broader portfolio than we do. Microchip and Atmel combined will do approximately $2 billion through their distribution channel. The combined product lines of Microchip and Atmel will be one of the most sought after broad-based product line with multiple opportunities for distribution for attaching Analog, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Memory, USB, Ethernet, timing products and others. The fifth concern raised has been -- our target is $0.33 accretion in fiscal year '17 and then $0.90 in fiscal year '19, this bridge is somewhat misunderstood. So let me clarify that. Let me first remind you about the accretion numbers again. They are $0.33 in fiscal year '17, $0.67 in fiscal year '18 and $0.90 in fiscal year '19. The accretion is coming from three factors. First, the operating expense reduction. Second, the gross margin improvement. And third, the revenue growth. The operating expense reduction is not a one year job, because of the size of the transaction we believe it will be a continuous effort over a three-year period to rationalize the R&D, as well as SG&A expenses and bring them into Microchip's cost structure. The gross margin improvement is also gradual through improvement of manufacturing efficiency, as well as higher or lower emphasis on products lines based on their gross margin. And then there will be revenue synergy also contributing to the EPS synergy. Atmel's revenue has been declining for the last five years as they have restructured out of the very large touch business, and they also sold the serial flash business with company called Adesto. We are confident that Atmel's revenue will widen [ph] in the first half of 2016 and then grow afterwards. We also see a significant opportunity to attach analog and other connectivity products to Atmel's microcontrollers like we have been successful with Microchip's microcontrollers. In fact, I see the analog attached opportunities with Atmel's microcontrollers to be a bonanza for our analog business. A combination of all these factors builds the accretion from $0.33 in fiscal '17 to $0.67 in fiscal year '18 to $0.90 in fiscal year '19. The final concern we have heard about is the size of the deal. Microchip has been successful in smaller deals, can we duplicate that success with this larger deal. Now I must say that we heard this concern when we bought SMSC also. SMSC was 4X larger than any deal we had done prior to that. Microchip today is a $2.2 billion company and is capable of taking on a larger acquisition compared to what we could do a few years ago. Atmel's business is also quite familiar to us which was unlike the case with SFT, SMSC etcetera. As I said before, Microchip management is capable of transforming its organization, resources and strategy to meet the challenges of a given time. Just today we announced the promotion of Ganesh Moorthy to President and COO. In addition to Ganesh deserving of the promotion, it is also a recognition of the fact that we are taking on an acquisition that's about 47% of our own size and it will require Ganesh and I both to manage this enterprise with all of the travel involved worldwide. We're also adjusting the organization below us to adapt to this new reality. Microchip is an incredible executive development machine. You may not know this but Microchip has not hired a VP level person from outside the company for over 15 years, although we have gained some VPs through our acquisitions. Through training, mentoring, and developing we have groomed our own executives that have replaced some of the retirements that have taken place, as well as provided the leadership bandwidth required to effectively manage the growth that we have experienced. You cannot imagine the familiarity, understanding, cohesiveness, speed of execution and constancy of purpose that it builds in the organization. This culture has been one of the hallmarks of our success. We have been able to extend this culture to our many acquisitions and we believe that we will be able to achieve the same with Atmel. I hope that it alleviates some of your concerns. In closing, I would like to say that the December quarter marks the bottom for us for this correction and we are expecting a low single-digit sequential growth in the March quarter. Beyond the March quarter we get into two back-to-back seasonally stronger quarters for Microchip. These quarters beyond organic growth will also have incremental accretion from the restructuring of Micrel and these quarters will begin to have accretion from the closing of the Atmel transaction. This triple effect coming from organic growth, accretion from Micrel and accretion from Atmel will set up the earnings growth momentum that we expect will lead us to a 23% non-GAAP EPS growth from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017. With this operator, will you please poll for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first question to Vivek Arora [ph] at Bank of America.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the good execution. Steve you mentioned March as seasonal, and I think you said China down and I believe Europe and perhaps U.S. up. Given that you have exposure to such a large range of customers, what are you hearing from your customers just in terms of your specific demand environment? Do you think it appears normal or do you think there are ways versus what you would have thought entering this year? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: The demand environment in U.S. and Europe is about normal. The demand environment in China has been weaker than normal but we were the first ones to call the weakness in China which the industry has been experiencing for some time now. And we have modeled that weakness of China and especially also because of the Chinese New Year into our guidance that we have provided today.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And the fact that probably squeezing just a quick follow-up on just microcontroller segment growth in calendar '15, I think you mentioned you gained share and assume that there were likely tailwinds from IoT and autos and other area. But then how do we explain the sales actually being down somewhat year-on-year? Was it an inventory issue? Was it geographic issue? Like one should have expected your sales to grow if you were gaining share and you had tailwinds from a number of these new secular road [ph] segment? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Well, that depends on what the total number were for microcontrollers. As we have monitored the numbers and earnings report coming out from various other companies, the microcontrollers have been down significantly. So I think once the Dataquest numbers come out, Gartner data come out, you can see what has happened to the market share. We have tracked our performance against the SIA which come out more routinely and we have shown it to you at certain conferences and the grass has looked up into the right where we have been gaining share. Now gaining share doesn't necessarily mean that the numbers are up year-over-year, you could gain share with flat or 1% down business if the business shrunk more than that.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Harlan Sur at JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question and Ganesh, congratulations on the promotion. On the $0.05 more of accretion you're targeting on an annualized basis exiting fiscal year '17, just wondering is that better synergies on the COG side or OpEx side or combination of both?
Steve Sanghi: It's combination of three factors; better synergies on the OpEx, better synergies on the gross margin that we can now anticipate as we are getting closer to closing the fab, and we're also seeing significant revenue synergies as we have really taken their product line to our distribution and broad-based direct customers. We're seeing -- we are modelling some revenue synergies also. So $0.05 is a small difference but not that small either, $0.05 would be $11 million to $12 million on an annualized basis and that's how much better we are seeing Micrel today than we saw just a quarter ago.
Harlan Sur: Great, thanks for the insight there, Steve. And then automotive, was there a relative and bright spot in the December quarter, I think we saw the -- number had a pretty strong snap out. I think you called it a relatively bright spot in your business last quarter. How do you see your broad automotive end markets trending here in the March quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Automotive was strong as you noted in the December quarter and continues to be a stronger segment than some of the other ones. It's consistent with what you've seen and in the other reports about automotive. It remains one of the more resilient market segments even in the broad-based weakness.
Harlan Sur: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from John Pitzer at Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. Ganesh, congratulations as well. You did a good job in the December quarter taking inventory down. In the press release you talked about growing inventory in the March quarter, and Steve, I'm wondering if you could just help me understand is that kind of normal seasonal or is that sort of a habitué [ph] of kind of your expectations for demand as you look beyond March. Give me the explanation behind the inventory going back up in the March quarter?
Eric Bjornholt: John, this is Eric. So we had some extended shutdowns in the December quarter in our wafer fab that aren't going to repeat in the March quarter and that's the biggest change that's happened quarter-on-quarter.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. Maybe I could sneak another one in. I guess Steve, the farm [ph] what you assumed Micrel did in the December quarter is going to do in the March quarter. It does look if you back that out as if the year-over-year growth for the core business is down, anywhere from 6% to 8% in December and down again 6% to 8% year-over-year at March which does seem to be lagging the peers. Now I know in your prepared remarks you said you feel confident that you're gaining share, I'm just hoping maybe you can help elaborate on that. And I think you also put the qualifier in there, in the markets that you address. And so help me understand, do you think that your served addressable market is growing slower than the overall addressable market for market controllers and that's one of the reasons for the disconnect?
Steve Sanghi: I think in trying to calculate those percentages you are probably highly off on the Micrel revenue. Our numbers are in front of me where we could follow it offline. I don't believe your calculations are correct.
John Pitzer: Okay. Could you just talk to in general why you're so confident that you're not losing share, that you're actually gaining share Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Well, when we look at -- compare our 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit against SIA numbers we're confident that we gained share in 8-bit, we gained share in 16-bit, we gained share in 32-bit, and we clearly gained share in analog because there has been a significant growth in analog. We have declined some in the memory business; we declined in some of the other miscellaneous. When we have acquired these companies, these companies already did some of the foundry business. Supertex had some foundry business where any companies with this six inch fabs, they under loaded and they attempt to take odds and ends of foundry business doing some work for other people which goes on for years because nobody wants to move it, it's going to be small amount of work. When you close the fab that part of the business atrophies because nobody wants to transfer it to another fab. Atmel has some foundry business, also Supertex had it, Micrel had it. We put that all in the other, so I think when you look at all that our core businesses have all done well. You can compare our core business to Atmel, you can compare it to Renaissance [ph], you can compare it to anybody else and when the numbers come out from Gartner we can share that with you.
John Pitzer: Helpful, thanks guys.
Steve Sanghi: I think other thing John I would say is that we had largely broken out the organic versus inorganic numbers based on your request, you may recall. And I don't think it has helped us. You know the thing the investors and analysts have to recognize is that these acquisitions are an enormous amount of work, we take an enormous amount of Microchip executives and our people and our energy to bring these acquisitions which were underperforming, really doing nothing. Micrel had done 6.7% operating profit in the quarter we bought them. And now their operating profits are approaching 20% and will be 30% or higher by the time we are done. All that effort would have gone into our business. In many cases -- take the case of Micrel for example, we terminated one of our product, a Gigabit Ethernet and we decided to take a Gigabit Ethernet from Micrel and market it further because they were further along in the development of that product. So when you look at it year, two years, three years down the line -- when you guys, the way you interpret organic versus inorganic, you basically take all the earnings that we have produced, all the revenue that we have produced, all the work that we have done to take these acquisitions which were essentially making new -- no money, and make hundreds of millions of dollars from these acquisitions to bring them into 30% plus operating profit, and you take them out from the cap and saying our core business isn't doing well, thank you very much. Operator, next question.
Operator: We'll go next to Craig Hettenbach at Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach: Yes, thank you. Steve, just question on Atmel, you mentioned that you will be doing some visits and you meet with some of the executives into Colorado, just -- I just start to do these meetings, any additional color you'd provide in terms of kind of what you're learning incrementally about the business and how that fits into the deal?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we're not learning much about the business at this point in time. Atmel is essentially not shedding anything about the business. We still see that Antitrust hasn't cleared and we still see the businesses as competitive. We're largely getting through the people, we tour the facility, we're learning where people are located, we're starting to formulate some initial thoughts about how we will go about the integration. We have done enough of these that we know what burdens we have to push and what we have to do so we can get there quite quickly. But in the two weeks that have passed, they are not letting us into the business yet.
Craig Hettenbach: Understood. Just other follow-up in terms of kind of being at the bottom here and then you guys have seen some of this first and then been out in front of it. That said are there still any kind of variations by different geographies or end markets or from a bookings perspective at this point is that kind of stable and seasonal?
Steve Sanghi: I don't have any end market commentary but from a geography standpoint it is clearly a distinction, I mean the world knows at this point in time that China is weaker than normal and we're finding that U.S. and Europe to be normal.
Craig Hettenbach: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Daily [ph] at Citi.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks guys. Steve, just a question on the China weakness, you said you're baking it into the guidance this quarter. When you talk about the 23% EPS growth in fiscal '17 do you think the China weakness last beyond this quarter? And then if you could just share us your insights as to why or why not, that would be great. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: Chris, I'm not going to comment what the industry would do beyond this quarter but whatever our assessment is of that is baked into when they are talking about 23% EPS growth.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it, okay. And then Ganesh, you commented on the automotive end market. To the extent you can -- can you just give us your comments on the other -- sort of main end markets, how they have been? How they are looking this quarter perhaps industrial consumer etcetera?
Ganesh Moorthy: It is hard to predict exactly what segments are going to do and how they are going to do in the quarter. Clearly, we can see where the strength is. There is other softness we've seen in some of the China related -- many of China has consumer content that goes with it. Our PC segment is doing reasonably well, even though I know the macro PC has other issues because we play in some of the more value-added segments in the office computing, in the server side, some of the PC peripherals, all of that. And -- so there is nothing that stands out, I think automotive stands out because it's relatively strong compared to others.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: We'll go next to William Stein at SunTrust.
William Stein: Great, thanks for taking my question. First, I'm hoping Steve you can talk a little bit about when you highlight the very strong accretion you expect from Atmel, can you talk a bit about how much you expect to come from revenue synergies and perhaps highlight how front end or back end loaded you anticipate that be?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we did not break the synergies into OpEx growth margin and revenue growth and we're not going to. Some of the work has been done by our knowledge and assessment and experience and applying cycles of learning or the previous acquisitions. As I said earlier, Atmel management hasn't let us into the business to really do a bottoms up on product line by product line, cost by cost, wafer by wafer, ASP by ASP. So the analysis is not done at that level, it's done at a more higher level but our experience shows just look at Micrel, I mean this is the second or third time we have increased the accretion guidance on Micrel, we did the same thing with SMSC. So, we think the numbers we have given you are good but we are not going to break it down further by the three pieces.
William Stein: Understood. Maybe one for Eric, I think you mentioned there was a special income of $5 million in the quarter, did I hear that right? And can you elaborate as to what that is and whether it repeats?
Eric Bjornholt: Yes, so it does not repeat so we had a couple of things happen in the quarter. On the legal front we had a settlements that brought some income in the Microchip and there was a couple of settlements that went out and the net of those were essentially the $5 million.
William Stein: Great, thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Then not in the non-GAAP. Are they in the non-GAAP?
Eric Bjornholt: Yes, they are not in the non-GAAP.
Steve Sanghi: They are not in the non-GAAP; they are only in the GAAP.
William Stein: Understood, thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Caso at Susquehanna Financial Group.
Chris Caso: Thank you. With respect to Atmel and just some of the comments that you had made regarding the amount of business I guess you'd essentially look to keep from that. You talked about, about 95% of the business -- I guess essentially meeting your margins criteria. Should we gather from that that as we go forward those 95% of the business lines you would continue them and eventually the goal would be to get those up to Microchip margin targets. Is that the right interpretation of what you said there?
Steve Sanghi: Well, look at the history of what we have done. The same kind of concerns were raised with SMSC. Did we sell a product line from SMSC? Did we discontinue the PC business? Did we discontinue the other parts of the business? This question is raised every time. When we go in we assess the situation, we look at all the product lines, we see how it maps to our product line, what the margins are, we put higher focus on the product lines which we can grow faster at higher margin, we put less focus on the product lines that have lower margin and we change the model mix, we change the factory strategy, we shutdown factories, we move things around. In every acquisition we have gotten those results. Two weeks after announcing the acquisition and the one in which basically we got very little insight into the company because of competitive factors compared to any of our acquisitions. Why do you guys always assume that the gross margin improvement has to happen only from discontinuing the product lines, those pieces have been there before and they will always run? We didn't do that in the prior acquisition and yes, we got them into last quarter, the December quarter. Supertex gross margin was 17%, actual data.
Ganesh Moorthy: Chris, if you look at the January 19 presentation that we put up and we announced the transaction I think you will see what our top process was relative to gross margin overtime and expenses overtime as we combined the two companies. And you will see that there is improvement in all areas that we're planning on.
Chris Caso: Right, okay. Just addressing one of the other things you had brought up with Atmel as well, and the leverage. Maybe you could speak to how you have looked at this perhaps under different macro conditions and obviously neither you nor I can predict what the macro does over the next two or three years. But how have you looked at this through a bunch of different market conditions? I know in the past when we've hit downturns, you've been able to ramp back OpEx for Microchip in order to protect EPS. Do you feel the same confidence in the ability to do that on the Microchip with some leverage as you're in the process of paying down at leverage from the deal?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, I think the answer of that is yes. And I think I spoke about it in the last conference call. I mean do you really think conservative management like Microchip will take on this acquisition and leverage without doing a real heavyweight downside analysis and seeing in there where the leverage gets to -- is there any threat to the dividend, what happens to the cash flow, what happens to the capital, do you think we really would do that? So, trust us that we did a real bottoms up analysis and what happens in every downside is our capital needs dry up. Then we have shared with you before in graphs that our capital needs are self-sustaining but a small amount of capital is sustaining but then the rest of the capital is kind of growth in new technologies and all that. And what we find is in a down environment the capital needs dry up. When the capital needs dry up, there is a huge cash flow that comes up because you don't have to really spend all that money on capital. So, we did a downside analysis and the total leverage metric is 5 and the senior leverage hurdle is 3 and we don't really get close to those by taking all those factors into account.
Chris Caso: Alright, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Harsh Kumar at Stephens Investment Banking.
Harsh Kumar: Steve, I wanted to ask you about analog, you talked about it being a bonanza. Could you just tell us about -- I know that the Microchip analog attach rate is very high for its own microcontroller. What is your expectation with Atmel? Do you think you can get a similar level of attach rate with some of their products? Is there anything that Atmel makes that you can leverage through your salesforce? Any color would be great.
Steve Sanghi: Harsh, the answer to that is yes. Where it works is, a customer sits down to lay out the board and when they choose a microcontroller they start to write the code and the analog is fit in later. I need a supervisor, I need an LDO, I think I need an A to D converter, I think I need this and that. So those are things that you can attach it on the microcontroller and many time those selections are made many months later. But when a microcontroller manufacturer like us has its own analog, so one of the advantage we have is we can sample all the things that customer needs in their application, right away. So when the customer is ready, it's handy already, it's available in front of his eyes. And the attach rate to the Atmel's microcontroller would be very similar, that's the first thing we would do to take all of their black diagrams worldwide that exists out to customers and really see whose analog is around.
Harsh Kumar: Got it, very helpful Steve. And then as a follow-up if I can ask you, I've seen you acquire a bunch of companies here in the last seven/eight years, and most of them have been successful, some underway to that track. When you buy a company Steve, when you look at a new acquisition, what kind of up margin goals do you have for them? We have seen some of the older ones that are done well into the 30s but is there a number or hurdle rate that you can share with us or perhaps even arrange or qualitatively even?
Steve Sanghi: I think Harsh I rather not because that becomes a model for the next acquisition regarding what I could pay.
Harsh Kumar: That's fair, appreciate it.
Operator: We'll take the next question from Raj Bindra Gill [ph] at Needham & Company.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Steve, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the IoT strategy going forward now that you've acquired Atmel's assets. And can you talk a little bit about what they bring to the table and what you have with your existing portfolio and how you think you would be able to get -- generate competitive advantage with respect to that market?
Steve Sanghi: As just in the last call, that -- IoT is very hard to define, what you put in IoT and a lot of people put the entire microcontrollers in IoT and if you do that we've been well over a $1 billion of business but very strict definition of IoT would be really not counting the microcontroller but when really the application is really connected on the internet wirelessly through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or whatever. So, I mean our IoT business is approximately twice the size of Atmel's IoT business, I mean somebody could count it differently how you define it but counting apples-to-apples. So it grows that business by 50%. We had all the functionality; we had the Wi-Fi, the Bluetooth, the BLE. So we had all the functionality, from that standpoint we don't really get something new but when you get a scale -- 50% larger scale, and secondly when you get into individual specs and products, people could argue my product is better than, mine is lower power and mine is larger range, and this and that and that and the combination of those we're going to get in some cases way better and in some cases they are better. Together we will cover more of the market with 50% larger scale.
Ganesh Moorthy: And if I can add to that, I think the other part of IoT which is growing is the security of the nodes themselves and Atmel does have awesome good products line that address that. So you put the two together, it's a more powerful combination than what we had individually.
Unidentified Analyst: And as my follow-up, in terms of the consolidation that's occurring in the semiconductor industry, how do you look at your competitors are positioning now with the acquisition of Atmel, say vis-à-vis NXP/Freescale who are also going to have a large portfolio of 8-bit to 32-bit microcontroller assets. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: The way we look at it is, we don't look at any of the acquisition that is a must for us. We have not preceded any of the past acquisitions we have done with the eye towards that it's an acquisition that we must do. We have done them because we found them, we were able to get them either at a reasonable price or we're able to build a model where it would make sense but you've seen us walk away from acquisition, like we've walked away from CSL, we walked away from many, many other that did not come in the public domain. We competed with Freescale when there were multi-billion dollar revenue company, $4 billion to $5 billion revenue company, and Microchip was just a $100 million, $200 million then $500 million and then $1 billion. And we have constantly competed being a much smaller company with assets, with TI, with Freescale, and with ST-Micro and others. Scale is important but just scale for the sake of scale with not good products lines and not good execution and all that -- lot of larger companies have terrible business model. Still Atmel to compete with NXP and Freescale we could compete with both of them individually and together ourselves fine. We did Atmel for the reasons we have described earlier.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks for that.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Cassidy at Stifel.
Kevin Cassidy: Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations Ganesh. What are the strengths that Microchip has had with your microcontrollers if you have a consistent development tool for 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit? Do you plan on bringing the Atmel products under that same development tool umbrella, is that possible or will you be running two separate tools?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's early days, Atmel also has a very good development tool environment that they run for their products and as we move forward, we'll look at other ways for Atmel products to work under the Microchip development tools, other way is for Microchip products to work under the Atmel development tools. There is a lot more to be discovered and done and when we get to the stage where we can engage in more detail with them. Development tools to the engineers are a very touchy subject and it's one that it's important for them to feel comfortable designing with our entire portfolio, we thought they've gotten used to. And I think that our ways to slowly overtime building the ability for each other's products to be fit underneath the development tools that are available. So, more to come on that but I think both companies have strong development tools, Microchip obviously has had them over the entire 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit portfolio and Atmel has one for the AVR products and one for the ARM products. And we'll look for ways to make it so that design engineers find it sticky using our development tools.
Kevin Cassidy: Alright. Okay, great.
Steve Sanghi: Let me add little bit to it. I just kind of get the feeling here that Investor Analysts have made too much of it. For years, yes, we have had a common development tool because we could. All these things were developed internally at 8-bit and 16-bit was an internal architecture and one of the thing – reason, part of the reason we also choose MIPS was because we were able to work with them in a way that we could bring them into a common development environment and Microchip tool set we want to extend to MIPS architecture. But no other company has it. Freescale has number of development environments for Power to PC, for ARM architecture, for the 8-bit product line, 16-bit product line. Atmel has them, AVR, they have -- number of other companies have the similar. Silica [ph] have 8051 for 8-bit and then it's ARM for 32-bit, so no other company has it, those companies aren't dead. Now true if we had bought a company with the same architecture, it will be incrementally better but I think Street is looking at like it's dead, like it breaks that tool and then therefore it is the end of the world. These are highly successful product lines in their own right. At other companies they have existed with multiple architectures, they can exist under multiple architectures at Microchip. We already have -- we have a on-development tool that sells products from SMSC, Rob [ph] Networks had it. So we use other architecture, we use 8051, we use ARP, we use ARM but it's predominantly our own architecture, we would agree with it but we have already in the last few years with other smaller acquisitions already introduced ARM-based products. And if you were taking an ARM-based product that had no momentum, that was nowhere then that would be promotable challenge to develop it but it's a successful product line, and so is the AVR 8-bit. So I just think -- look at it in that light. And on the ARM itself for eight years you guys have hounded us for not having ARM that was a negative. Now we have ARM and somehow it's negative again. You can't have it both ways.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay. I wasn't taking that as a negative but what about as we look out there, your automotive business, where are you getting more attraction? Is it with microcontrollers or analog?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's both. Again, as Steve mentioned earlier on, we don't go into a socket trying to win a single product in it. We obviously get in early because the microcontrollers are some of the earlier decisions that people have to make but it's microcontrollers, it's analog, it's memory, it's the clocks. And as we broaden the portfolio it gives us more opportunities to attach in a given application, automotive or otherwise.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay, thank you.
Operator: That is all the time we have for this call. Mr. Sanghi, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Well, I just wanted to say that thanks for attending the call today. And there are number of conferences we'll be going to in the month of February and early March and we'll see you on the road. Thank you very much.
Operator: That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q2  (2015-11-04 17:00:00) =====
Executives: J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Analysts: Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Christopher B.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Second Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Micrel acquisition, which closed on August 3. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were above the midpoint of our upwardly revised guidance at a record $559.4 million, including $39.5 million of non-GAAP net sales from Micrel, and were up 4.8% sequentially from net sales of $534 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $18 million higher than GAAP net sales, as GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sellthrough of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs. Revenue by product line in the September quarter was $334.3 million for Microcontrollers, $165.3 million for Analog, $30.2 million for Memory, $23.2 million for Licensing, and $6.5 million of Other. Revenue by geography was $107.5 million in the Americas, $114.7 million in Europe, and $337.2 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.9% in the September quarter and above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27.5% of sales, near the bottom end of our guidance range, and non-GAAP operating income was 30.4% of sales, which was above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $142.9 million, resulting in $0.66 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our upwardly revised guidance and $0.03 above the midpoint. On a GAAP basis, net sales were$ 541.4 million, and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition related expenses, were 55.6% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.4 million of share-based compensation, $11.5 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustment I mentioned earlier, and $9.1 million in acquired inventory evaluation cost and acquisition related restructuring cost. Total operating expenses were $226 million or 41.7% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $43.8 million, share-based compensation of $20.6 million, $1.1 million of acquisition-related expenses, and special charges of $6.6 million. GAAP net income was $64.9 million or $0.30 per diluted share. We had GAAP non-recurring unfavorable tax events in the quarter of $6 million, which were primarily driven by reporting a valuation allowance against some state tax credits. In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.5%, and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 20.3%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the impact of some of the Micrel acquisition purchase accounting adjustments. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business, and the tax effect of various non-recurring items. Excluding any non-recurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 11% and 12%. To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the September quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.229, share -based compensation was about $0.067, non-recurring unfavorable tax events were about $0.028, and non-cash interest expense was about $0.036. The dividend declared today of $0.3585 per share will be paid on December 4, 2015, to shareholders of record on November 20, 2015. The cash payments associated with this dividend is expected to be about $72.9 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 53rd consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend, and, in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 47th occasion we have increased the dividend payment, and our cumulative dividends paid are $2.66 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. During the same time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, excluding the issuance and subsequent buyback of the shares in the Micrel acquisition. Our combined cash returned to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is over $4 billion. Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory at September 30, 2015, was $363.8 million and includes $37.2 million of fair value markup on Micrel's inventory required by GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 125 days of inventory at September 30, 2015, which is up by two days from the levels at the end of the June quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors is at 35 days, which is down two days from the June quarter levels. I want to remind you that historically Microchip's distribution revenue throughout the world has been recognized on a sellthrough basis. Micrel has some distributors that are recognizing revenue on a sell-in basis. Microchip is changing the contractual relationships with these distributors during the December quarter, which will result in sellthrough revenue recognition in the future. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sellthrough revenue recognition for the Micrel distributors for the entire December quarter in order to provide investors with a view of the true end market demand for our products. There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition, as any inventory in the distribution channel at the date of the conversion to sellthrough accounting will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes. The cash generation in the September quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment, and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was $150 million. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.586 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $1.296 billion. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $110 million to $120 million in the December quarter. Capital spending was approximately $29.9 million in the September quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $125 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $26.2 million. Over the past several years, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders have been treated as return of capital, as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. Due to the Micrel acquisition, Microchip will have earnings and profits in the United States in fiscal year 2016 as we restructure their business into Microchip's corporate structure, which produces a lower tax rate by moving Micrel's foreign intellectual property rights offshore. Through this transaction, we expect to bring back about $250 million of offshore cash to the U.S., and we don't anticipate paying any cash taxes on that amount as we can use net operating losses to offset that income. We do not have an exact calculation of how much of the dividend payments will be classified as taxable dividends versus return of capital, but our initial estimates are that between 80% and 90% of the calendar year 2015 dividend will be taxable as dividends to our shareholders. We will provide a more accurate estimate of the taxable portion of the dividend in early January. This is a one-time event associated with the Micrel acquisition, but it could occur again in the future if an acquisition with a similar fact pattern to Micrel occurred. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Since this is the first time we are including results from Micrel, before I jump into the product line details, let me remind you how we will be reporting Micrel's results as part of our public reporting segments. As Eric has already mentioned, what's included in our reporting is a partial quarter of Micrel's September quarter results, starting from the close date of August 3. Of the Micrel revenue, approximately 3% was derived from foundry services where Micrel manufactured custom products designed by customers. This revenue is included in our public reporting segment called Other. The remaining 97% of Micrel's revenue was derived from products developed by Micrel. Of this revenue, over 99.5% of Micrel's revenue this quarter is part of our Analog reporting segment, while less than 0.5% of Micrel's revenue this quarter is part of our Microcontroller reporting segment. With that clarification, now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with Microcontrollers. Our Microcontroller revenue was down 4% in the September quarter, as compared to the June quarter. We experienced the same broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peer group companies. In aggregate, over the last four rolling quarters, our Microcontroller business was up 2.7% over the prior four rolling quarters. We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers that we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. Microcontrollers represented 59.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter, down a little from last quarter, as Micrel's revenue contributed predominately to our Analog reporting segment. Moving to Analog, our Analog business, excluding Micrel results, was about flat in the September quarter, as compared to the June quarter, and was up 3.6%, as compared to the year ago quarter. In this business too, we experienced a broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peers. In aggregate, over the last four rolling quarters, our Analog business was up 8.6% over the prior four rolling quarters. Our Analog business, including Micrel results, was up 30.1% in the September quarter, as compared to the June quarter, and was up 34.8%, as compared to the year ago quarter. Including Micrel, our Analog business represented 29.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our Analog business, complemented by the products added to our portfolio through acquisitions. Moving to our Memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E Squared (13:53) memory products as well as our SuperFlash memory products, this business was down 4.8% in the September quarter, as compared to the June quarter. We continue to run our Memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business, and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solution. Our Memory business represented 5.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. Now a short update about Micrel and where we are in the integration process. Micrel's Analog Power business and Ethernet business have been completely integrated into Microchip's businesses that focus on the same segments. Micrel's Timing and Communications business remains a standalone business that is part of our Analog reporting segment. This is a brand-new field of play for Microchip that we are excited about and see sales synergies with our existing product lines. It also gives us visibility into a range of applications and customers that are new to Microchip, who could be customers for our microcontroller, analog, and memory products. The sales and manufacturing integration continues to go well against our plan. Steve will comment in more detail in his section along with how we expect to see the accretion results rolling out over time. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, the Micrel acquisition, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2016, including comments on the progress of integration for Micrel. Our September quarter results were better than our upwardly revised guidance. The revenue, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, and operating profit percentage were all better than the midpoint of our guidance. Overall, we executed the quarter extremely well amidst very difficult industry conditions and ended the quarter with an all-time record net sales. We also achieved the top end of our upwardly revised non-GAAP earnings-per-share guidance and beat the midpoint by $0.03 per share. The June quarter was also our 100th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their dedication and contribution in this remarkable achievement of 100 consecutive profitable quarters, an achievement unmatched in our industry. I also want to thank our 90,000 plus customers worldwide for the trust they place in us in selecting our solutions as well as our shareholders, particularly our long-term shareholders, who have steadfastly supported us as we built one of the best semiconductor franchises in the industry. I will now provide guidance for the December quarter, including Micrel revenue. December quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter of the year. Investors should be careful in calculating this seasonality because in 2012, we completed the acquisition of SMSC on August 2, and in 2014, we completed the acquisition of ISSC on July 18. Therefore, December quarter for those years reflected full quarter of revenue from acquisitions, while September quarter included partial quarters and hence the stronger seasonality for the December quarter. The exact calculation of seasonality without the effect of these two acquisitions for the past five years is minus 3.03%. We believe that industry conditions continue to be very weak. At the same time, we began this inventory correction earlier than most companies and believe that we are nearing the end of it. We expect our net sales in the December quarter, excluding Micrel, to be down between 2% and 6% sequentially. We expect Micrel sales for the full December quarter to be between $51 million and $54 million. Adding Micrel sales, we expect the headline total net sales for Microchip for December quarter to be between $539.7 million and $563.5 million, which are between up 0.7% to down 3.5% sequentially. As we're nearing the end of this correction, we expect the March 2016 quarter to be sequentially up by low-single-digit. I want to remind you that the guidance we are providing is for non-GAAP revenue, which will include sellthrough from the distributors of Micrel. The GAAP revenue will be lower since GAAP does not account for products sold through distributors that were shipped prior to the acquisition effective date. In the current quarter, we will also be converting many of Micrel distributors from sell-in revenue recognition to a sellthrough revenue recognition to be consistent with that of Microchip. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.7% to 57.9%, slightly negatively impacted by the full quarter of lower gross margin of Micrel. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 28.6%, and 29.3% of sales, and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.4% and 29.3% of sales, again, negatively impacted by the full quarter of higher expenses and lower operating profit of Micrel. We expect the non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.58 to $0.64 per share. Now, let me provide you with more updates on Micrel acquisition and integration. First of all, taking advantage of market volatility, Microchip repurchased the entire 8.626 million shares issued in the Micrel acquisition on the open market. This purchase was made at a net price of $42.17 per share, which is lower than the $42 – $42.888 price at which we issued shares in the Micrel acquisition. Since then, the stock price is up about $6.80 per share, so we made an excellent decision, and it substantially improves attrition from the Micrel acquisition. Ganesh has already covered some of the elements of our integration planning. I will cover a few other areas. After studying the business systems of both companies, we have laid out a plan that will transfer all of Micrel to Microchip's business systems. On November 1, 2015, just last week, late last week, we transferred all of Micrel's business to Microchip's IT business and financial systems. Current quarter's financial close will be on both systems, but for the next quarter, we will have the whole company on only Microchip's IT business and financial systems. Regarding manufacturing, Micrel operates a small 6-inch fab in San Jose, California, that is about 30% utilized. We have begun transferring all of the Micrel products from its 6-inch fab to Microchip's 8-inch facilities in Tempe, Arizona, and Gresham, Oregon. We currently anticipate that we will complete the transfer and close Micrel's fab in about one year from the acquisition date of August 3. Regarding backend manufacturing, Micrel subcontracts 100% of its assembly and test. Many of the packages that Micrel uses are different than Microchip's, but many are same. As in the other acquisitions, we are doing a careful make versus buy analysis on each package and product type. We have already decided to begin transferring some products from outside subcontractors to Microchip's Thailand facility. We will be transferring many more products over time, but keeping in mind that completing the closure of San Jose fab is our highest priority. Microchip is also combining the manufacturing systems, wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses, all these items are at various stages of integration and should all be completed by the end of first calendar quarter of 2016. Regarding sales force in the current quarter, we are combining sales forces and distribution of both companies. We expect that this will provide an expanded distribution channel for Micrel's products. With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. Micrel acquisition was about $0.007 accretive in the September quarter. We expect the Micrel acquisition to be about $0.011 accretive to the December quarter non-GAAP EPS. This accretion will continue to increase every quarter, reaching approximately $0.25 annual run rate by the end of calendar year 2016. These numbers depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy, in general. Finally, let me provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. Our track record has shown that Microchip has been able to improve the business model of its acquisitions, and our combined business model has remained virtually unchanged. As an example, in case of Supertex acquisition, which we closed on April 1, 2014, the gross margin last quarter was over 60%, and the operating profit was over 30%. At the same time – at the time of the acquisition, Supertex gross margin was 47%, and operating margin was only 9.3%. We believe that after San Jose fab of Micrel is closed and the oldest 6-inch inventory has been depleted, we will improve the financial model of Micrel also to be equivalent to that of Microchip. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, and inventory write-up, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call. With this operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: Thank you And we'll take the first question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. A question for Steve, just given some of the consolidation we've seen across semis, you guys have been very successful integrating a number of small to mid-sized deals. What's your view in terms of – do think you can replicate that success with bigger deals over time?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. We can replicate that success in the bigger deals, but we haven't found a deal that meets our purchase metrics.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up to that specific question, of the deals that you've done, I mean, the synergies are pretty clear in terms of improving margins. Any updates on ISSC or Supertex in terms of some revenue growth drivers that may be emerging as you look out over the next 12 to 18 months?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, yes. I gave the example of Supertex business model, which has improved very nicely, and we are – basically have lots of different design wins on Supertex that are in various stages of the incubation process. The design wins to production timeframe is usually a year and a half to two years on these complex designs, really from the date of the acquisition. So Supertex acquisition is now about 18 months, so I think probably another six months or more to go, and we should start to see some growth coming from these new design wins on Supertex. Regarding ISSC, I'll let Ganesh comment on it, how we're gaining the acceptance of Bluetooth worldwide with our ISSC efforts.
Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer: So when we acquired ISSC, their sales force was predominantly focused in Taiwan and in South China. But the opportunities for the Bluetooth products are really global, and over the last year plus, post the acquisition, the rest of the Microchip sales teams and channels have been working to expand the number of designs at customers that are Microchip traditional customers, and many of the applications that Microchip is strong at, so that all is activity that is in progress. We expect it will accrue as a design cycle gets completed, but we today have worldwide coverage of the ISSC product lines for Bluetooth opportunities as compared to what we inherited when we acquired the company.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you both for the color.
Operator: And our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. It's clear that some of your peers that have a sell-in based disti model are now working through inventories in the channel and at their customers, and in some cases, it's a pretty substantial inventory buildup. Obviously, you guys have been under shipping consumption and normal seasonal trends now for about four quarters. Steve, how confident is the team? What metrics are you looking at to give you confidence that in the March quarter, customer inventories are in the right place and that you'll be shipping to consumption and seeing some potential growth?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, Harlan, it's exactly the same question that investors and analysts have asked at a similar time in every cycle. We basically do not measure visibility by backlog, because it tends to vary by lead-times. We measure visibility by analyzing our business region by region, customer by customer, division by division, distributor by distributor, and looking at the inventory and sellthrough and all that. So just like we see the effects of the industry events earlier and began this correction earlier, we can also see that we are ending this correction earlier, and we are now poised to resume growth in the March quarter. We were telling you when nobody was admitting that there is a substantial sell-in driven inventory build being built in distribution, and we were not getting a lot of agreement from a lot of the analysts at that time. But now you have seen, as the results have come out, that there is a substantial inventory build, and a number of companies are guiding down quite substantially, as they take that drop because of sell-in driven revenue recognition.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks, Steve.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Operator: Next will be Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yes. Thank you. For first question, perhaps, you could talk about what you're seeing from a geographic perspective. Obviously, a lot of your peers have seen weakness that was really focused on China. And then, following on from that, Steve, given your commentary on the March quarter, typically you do have the Chinese New Year effect that affects your March quarter with growth elsewhere. Is that sort of still what you're expecting, and that's kind of baked into your expectation where we'll see some growth in the March quarter?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I mean, as far as China is concerned, I mean, we actually called it first. We were seeing substantial issues in China at thousands of small customers, who pull their horns very, very quickly because when the small customers make a mistake just once, the end result is you go out of business, while the large companies have substantial cushion and can carry inventories and correct them over time and can cash flow and buy through distributors and contract manufacturers and can return parts and do all those things. And many of the small customers, when they make a mistake, there is no second chance. So that's why our visibility to thousands and thousands of small customers have always taught us over the years and over the decades actually that we get a glimpse of what's coming ahead in the business first, and which is what we had told you. So, yes, the problems materialized in China as we expected. Now, as you look at the next quarter. Yes, it's a year of the Chinese New Year, the quarter of the Chinese New Year, and we will expect our business in China and Asia to be sequentially down. But we make up for that elsewhere with a very, very strong Europe and a good America. And many times, our March quarter is sequentially up, and we expect this time, too.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay, great. Moving on to some of your commentary with regard to Micrel and the accretion that you expect, specifically getting to that $0.25 run rate by the end of the year, is really the catalyst for that getting the fab closed, and you talked about that, I guess it's around the August timeframe? And am I right to expect that that's the biggest driver of getting to that full-year accretion number?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, that's the biggest driver. But there are others, too, as we continue to, for example, this quarter we moved all the IT and business and financial systems to Microchip. In the next quarter, you see a lot of the – some of the results, some of the expense and other reductions coming from that as we're not running two parallel systems, so there's accretion all along, every quarter higher. But the big one comes from fab, and it doesn't happen right away when the fab closes. It happens more after when some of the older higher-priced 6-inch inventory is sold, which is about six months after the fab closes. So that's why I'm saying around the end of next calendar year.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Right. And just the final follow-on, how would we see that in the gross – do you have a metric we can look at in terms of how that will benefit gross margins?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean, you should expect that that will – just like Supertex, we began with 47%, and last quarter its gross margin was over 60%. And that was exactly six quarters after we closed the Supertex deal. So six quarters after we close the Micrel deal, you can expect the gross margin to have a 6 in front of it.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great. All right. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Danely with Citigroup.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys. I didn't know I went from Jewish to Italian overnight. Hey, just a quick follow-up on Caso's question. So, Steve, between these cost savings on the OpEx versus gross margin side, would you say it's one third on the OpEx and two-thirds on the gross margin, or any little bit of color there would be appreciated?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: On the Micrel accretion?
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I haven't done the math on one-third, two-third, but I think the Micrel expenses are in the mid-30% range. And as we bring them towards mid-20% range, that's the synergy you should get from that. And then, the gross margins grow from, let's say, 50% to 60%.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Perfect. And then just for a brief follow-up, so I think most of your competitors have reported, you've seen their results or looking at your results, I mean, essentially, you guys are guiding for normal seasonality. I mean, how do you feel about your positioning versus the competition right now if you take a look at what your competitors have reported?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, Chris, why don't we just talk about our business and what we see and let them worry about theirs?
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Operator: The next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Well, thanks for taking the question. I'll start off with one for Ganesh. Ganesh, acknowledging that the Analog and MCU businesses have hundreds of products and tens of thousands of customers, the growth variance between the two seem to be at the wide end of what we typically see. Is there anything in particular going on in the two product lines, or is that just the byproduct of what we're seeing as we kind of wrap up an inventory correction?
Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer: The question – you said the growth between the two product lines are – say that again, please?
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: About 400 basis points difference, MCU is down 4% sequentially, Analog was flat. That 400 basis point variance, at least in my model, is at the wider end of the range we typically see.
Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer: Quarter to quarter, you're going to have small changes that are there. Analog has been growing faster for several quarters as you've seen. We're continuing to complement our organic growth with the acquisition growth, as well, over time. I would not take anything particular out of the numbers in one quarter, where you have a small difference in growth rate between Microcontrollers and Analog. Both product lines continue to perform well in terms of new designs, and we expect will continue to grow across the 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit spectrum in Micros and across a broader spectrum in Analog.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: And a follow-up on the upside, it sounds like all of the Micrel parts will port into Microchip fabs. One, is that so, and two, as we look at Microchip's internal versus external production capacity, where are we overall right now and where will we be once the Micrel port in is done?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, yes, confirmation that all of Micrel's parts will port into Microchip's two 8-inch facilities with the only exception that 100% of Micrel's parts don't run into Micrel fab. What was that number?
Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer: I'd say 70%.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: About 70% of their products ran in their own 6-inch fab and the rest ran in professional foundries. We're not bringing any of the professional foundries parts in at this stage, nor do we plan in future. We're simply bringing all the parts from the Micrel 6-inch fab to inside. The second part of your question was what?
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Microchip's internal fab intensity.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We can absorb all of Micrel products in our inside fab and still have plenty of clean room space left over in our Oregon fab to really add many, many hundreds of millions of dollars of additional revenue, so there's no really problem. There's lots of clean room space here to install the equipment as we go. With several quarters of weak performance we have had driven by very weak market, our factories are not full today. We just took a nine-day shutdown in our Oregon fab in the month of October, and in the current quarter, we have scheduled a similar shutdown in our Arizona fab in December. So even after absorbing all of Micrel products, I think we still have internally slightly higher inventory, not fully loaded, room to expand, and no problem.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: That's helpful color, Steve. Thank you, and then the last one a detail for Eric. You mentioned the $250 million cash onshoring. When will that occur, Eric?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: That will happen this month.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys.
Operator: The next question is from Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates.
Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates: Good evening. My question has been answered, and congratulations on that stock purchase. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Gil.
Operator: And we'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, a question for Steve and Ganesh. Guys, we've heard auto business commentary ranging from so-so, okay, all the way to horrible, at least in the short term – call it, last quarter, quarter and a half. I'm curious how your auto business is tracking relative to what we're hearing in the industry?
Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer: We have a range of both applications we're designed into as well as regions of the world. The overall automotive business was down in the quarter. Obviously, there are parts of the world where automotive is not doing as well. But there are also other parts of the world where it has been strong, and the sellthrough has been strong, the U.S. as a good example. So it follows geographically where the sales have been. But automotive continues to be in the current environment one of the stronger segments relative to the other segments for us.
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.: Understood. Thank you, Ganesh. And then, Steve, in your commentary, you talked about inventory correction nearing the end. But I gather, just reading between the parts and pieces that you talked about, that demand is still, call it, lackluster at best. As investors and as sell-side guys, what can we follow to get an idea as a factor, when demand will start to tick up for Microchip?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, considering we do business with 90,000-plus customers, it's very, very hard to really latch on to any kind of indicator. Most market checks that you occasionally – that you guys occasionally refer to does not seem to work for our business very, very well. We do business with – so, for example, just two weeks ago, I was in Asia, and I spent two weeks there. I met during that trip – I personally had meetings with 60-plus Asian distributors, at their presidents and product marketing heads that drive Microchip business, 60-plus, personally. And so, that's the view on a first-hand basis I bring to you regarding what I see there. And you cannot match that by any kind of so-called channel checks. So I just have trouble telling you really what you could track, because the business is just so diversified, so broad and 90,000 plus customers.
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.: Understood. Thanks, Steve.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Welcome.
Operator: The next question is from William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. First, a housekeeping one. Revenue total, I guess, I would call it non-GAAP revenue for Micrel, was that $39.5 million or higher than that?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: $39.5 million was Micrel's revenue, non-GAAP.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: For two months.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: For the two – understood. One other, understanding that we appear to be passing through the bottom of this cycle, I'm wondering if you can give us a view as to what growth coming out of it looks like. It seemed that in December of last year, Steve, you – as I recall, you seemed to indicate that we were coming out of it and then quickly sort of back into this not very good demand environment. I think now you're telling us we're sort of approaching the end of the inventory correction. How should we expect growth coming out of the cycle to look, both near-term where we'd normally expect sort of more of a snap back than just normal seasonality? And then, longer term how do think the business grows?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, you know, if you look at last year, in December, we were coming out of that, and our March quarter was sequentially up last year without any effect of any acquisition, totally clean. Our March quarter was sequentially up. And then, lots of other events developed, the whole falloff of the Chinese stock market, lots and lots of customers invested their money in the Chinese stock market and lost it, and Chinese payment terms are starting to mimic Italy. In many cases, our distributors are telling us they're concerned about getting paid. People are pushing out schedules, pushing out launch of the new products, cutting down the run rates, cutting down inventories, so there are additional things that happened. Now, all that environment is currently dialed in our guidance. You know, question is does it get any worse than that? Is there another shoe to drop or driven by anything. That we don't know. That kind of view we don't have. This is based on what we are able to see today.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question is from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Just going into a little more detail of the 60-plus distributors that you met with in Asia. Are they stocking distributors or more of a design type distributors that would prefer that you hold the inventory and they sell through?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, all these distributors, they hold the inventory. They also have dedicated application engineers for Microchip, which help the customer to design-in our products into the end customer socket. And then, they ship it from the inventory. The Asian distributors will hold in months of inventory, lesser inventory than an equivalent U.S. distributor will hold just because they work on much lower margin. So if they work on a lower margin, they have to hold lower inventory. Otherwise, it's not affordable. But they're all stocking distributors. So these are not like reps. What you're talking about is either reps or...
Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer: Design houses.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Design houses and things like that. We have some of those, too, but these people I'm talking about are real-life distributors.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So maybe for some of the visibility that maybe the design houses have, are you seeing design activity? Is this what gives you some optimism that you'll see a uptick in demand, that there's new designs happening?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So Asia-wide consolidated – I have the number for worldwide, also. I don't have it on my fingertips. But entire Asia combined – Asia, China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, everything – all Asia combined, our total design win dollar revenue was 15% higher this year than it was last year. So when I look at on the graph, how on a monthly basis design win dollars progressed, it was 15% higher than a year ago. But when you look at the net new revenue created from those designs this year versus the net new revenue created from new design wins last year, it was about a fourth of it, which was – and it was consistent geography to geography, distributor to distributor. Whether you look at Japan or you look at Korea or you look at China, it was really no different, which was a broad-based sign of very good excellent design win activity, but customers were all holding back, either not taking their designs to production or running much lower run rate in dollars on those designs in terms of unit consumption or not having the money to launch it. The effects of the Chinese stock market crash, I talked about. So this was universal across the board. And sooner or later, those customers got to run their businesses, also. When they take those designs to production, you will see sort of the other side of that, a very pent-up new product design activity. As it goes to production, the business really takes off.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Very good color. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: And we'll go next to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on 100 consecutive quarters of profitability. A question for Eric, the fact pattern, could you describe or give us a framework for thinking about the fact pattern that you have with Micrel that allows you to bring back cash tax-free? What are the circumstances there? Of the deals that you look at, as you guys look at, what percent of the targets or potential targets that you've been looking at have this kind of a fact pattern that might be – allow you to bring back more cash? Thank you.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: So, obviously, every transaction is different than the next. But in Micrel's situation, they had not really done any foreign tax planning. And unlike most companies in our space that are maybe more mature or higher revenue, higher profits, they've done that. And so, all of Micrel's IP was sitting, intellectual property, was sitting in the U.S. And so, to get that into our structure, we have to move that value of that intellectual property offshore. Microchip is sitting on some net operating losses in the U.S. that can soak up that income coming in. That's net operating losses that have been generated for a variety of different reasons over the course of time. But in this particular situation, we're able to bring the cash back and not pay cash taxes on that in the U.S.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, thanks for taking my follow-up question. And apologize if this was already answered, but on the manufacturing footprint, I think the team was going to do a major shutdown, I think PM on the Gresham fab in October. Did you guys actually execute to this? And then, given the lower December outlook and the rise of inventories in September, I assume that you guys are still planning for a December shutdown of the Tempe fab and then a few days extra beyond that to work down inventories. What do you expect your level of inventories to be exiting the December quarter?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So affirmative on both of those. We did execute the planned shutdown for the Gresham fab, and we are on schedule to execute a maintenance shutdown at the end of the year in our Arizona fab. The shutdown we had announced in the Arizona fab before, we're not making it any shorter, we're not making it any longer. We're holding it to what we have told you before. And the inventory going out of September quarter was 120 ...
J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: 125 days.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: 125 days total, and going out of December would be ...
J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: So our guidance that's in our release says that inventory will be between – well, it will be flat to up six days.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: Depending on the range of guidance.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. There you go.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Eric.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Sanghi, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we want to thank all the investors. I think the next major conference we go to will be the CSFB conference in Scottsdale, which is in our backyard. We'll get into great weather. So come out here, and we'll see you. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2016 Q1  (2015-08-03 06:00:00) =====

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Financial Results Conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the acquisition of Micrel, which was completed today.  We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our Web site at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of our operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Net sales in the June quarter were 534 million, below the midpoint of our guidance which was $555.5 million and we’re up 0.5% from non-GAAP net sales of $531.3 million in the June 2014 quarter. Revenue by product line in the June quarter was 348.2 million for microcontrollers, a $127.1 million for analog, $31.8 million for memory, $23.3 million for licensing and $3.7 million of other. Revenue by geography was a 104.5 million in the Americas, a 114.7 million in Europe and 314.7 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at 58.3% [technical difficulty]. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 25.6% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 32.6% of sales and net income was $148.9 million. This resulted in $0.69 per diluted share, which was at the low end of our guidance, was nonetheless a new record.  On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share based compensation and acquisition related expenses were 57.9% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins included the impact of 1.7 million of share-based compensation and 0.5 million in manufacturing shutdown costs associated with the Supertex wafer fab in San Jose. Total operating expenses were 187.7 million or 35.2% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of 34.6 million, share-based compensation of [technical difficulty], 2.2 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of 1.6 million. GAAP other expense includes a 13.8 million gain on the sale of the reminder of an investment that Microchip acquired as part of the SST acquisition back in 2010. And a $2.2 million gain on the sale of another investments. GAAP net income was $130.7 million or $0.60 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $18.7 million, which was primarily driven by the release of defer tax liability due to some IP ownership restructuring that occurred in that quarter, related to our prior acquisition of ISSC.  In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.4% and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 9.1%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the 18.7 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 11% to 12%.  To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the June quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.163, share-based compensation was about $0.049, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.086, a favorable difference on the sale of two investments during the quarter was about $0.074 and the difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP non-controlling interest in ISSC was a favorable of about $0.02 and non-cash interest expense was about $0.035. The dividend declared today of $0.358 per share will be paid on September 25, 2015, to shareholders of record on September 11, 2015. The cash payment associated with this dividend is expected to be about $75.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 52st consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. In fact, this quarter's increase marks the 46th occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividends paid amounts to almost $2.6 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.  During the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back 1.4 billion of our stock. Our combined cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is almost $4 billion.  Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory at June 30, 2015, was $303.7 million or 123 days, up by 12 days to the levels at the end of the March quarter. Inventory at our distributors was at 37 days and was flat to the March quarter levels. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We have taken actions to moderate our production activities and our foundry wafer purchases in the current quarter to moderate any inventory billed.  The cash generation in the June quarter, excluding the purchase of the remaining shares of ISSC that were outstanding, our dividend payment, the changes in borrowing levels under revolving line of credit was $143.8 million. As of June 30, the consolidated cash in total investment position was 2.43 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were 497 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $100 million to $120 million in the September quarter. Capital spending was approximately 33.6 million in the June quarter. We expect about 35 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 have been reduced from our previously guided 160 million to a 125 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourcing. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $24.7 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give this comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric and good afternoon everyone. Let’s take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was up 1.3% in the June quarter as compared to the year ago quarter. We experienced the same broad based weakness that has been reported by many of our peer group companies. In aggregate, over the last four rolling quarters, our microcontroller business was up 8% over the prior four rolling quarters. We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8 bit, 16 bit and 32 bit microcontrollers that we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain for the market share. Microcontrollers represented 65.2% of Microchip’s overall revenue in the June quarter. Moving to our analog business, our analog business was down 0.6% in the June quarter as compared to the year ago quarter. In this business too we experienced a broad based weakness that has been reported by many of our peers. In aggregate over the last four rolling quarters, our analog business was up 11% over the prior four rolling quarters. Our analog business represented 23.8% of Microchip’s overall revenue in the June quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products was down 4.8% in the June quarter as compared to the year ago quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serve [technical difficulty] to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 5.95% of Microchip’s overall revenue in the June quarter. Now a short update about Micrel and where we are in the integration process. Since the announcement of the acquisition on May 7th we have spent considerable time understanding Micrel’s businesses, organization and assistance. We have developed detailed integration plans that we have begun to execute today after the transaction closed. As we described in our May 7th conference call, Micrel has three product line business units and a small foundry services business. Micrel’s linear and power solutions business is a classic highly fragmented analog business. This business together with Microchip’s standard analog business form combined portfolio that will serve a broad base of applications and customers and enable a number of cross selling opportunities. Micrel’s LAN solutions business consists of a range of Ethernet products including controllers, switches and physical layers for different speeds. This business will strengthen Microchip’s overall Ethernet offering and also enable us to serve a broader set of applications and customers. Micrel’s timing solutions business consist of a comprehensive clock and timing portfolio including frequency control products, clock generation products and clock distribution products. It also includes MEMs technology capability that enables much smaller timing components. This is a brand new field of play for Microchip that we’re excited about and see sales synergies with our existing product lines. It also gives us visibility into a range of applications and customers that are new to Microchip who could be customers for our microcontroller analog and memory products. In regards to sales and field applications, we are planning to keep Micrel’s sales and applications engineers and we’ll cross-train them as well as our existing sales force so that we can find revenue synergies through cross selling opportunities. We also plan to combine the distribution networks of the two companies. Some of the distributors for the two companies are the same while others are different. And our goal is to achieve expanded distribution capabilities for the products of both companies. In regards to manufacturing, Steve will comment in more detail in his section along with how we expect to see the accretion results rolling out over time. With that, let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, the Micrel acquisition, as well as the guidance going forward.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh and good afternoon everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2016 including comments on the integration plan for Micrel. Our June quarter results were shy of our guidance, but were consistent with what other than the semiconductor industry have reported. The quarter started out well but the negative effects of the very weak economy in China and challenges in Europe led by a very weak Euro caused us to finish the quarter below our guidance in revenue. We were able to keep the non-GAAP gross margin percentage and earnings per share within the guidance albeit on the low end of it. Gross margin of 58.3% operating expenses of 25.6% and operating profit of 32.6% were all very respectable achievements. The June quarter was also our 99th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 99th consecutive profitable quarters. I look forward to the current quarter being our 100th consecutive profitable quarter, an achievement unmatched in our industry. I will now provide guidance for the September quarter including Micrel revenue. Our guidance is based on the assumption that Europe will continue to be in the doldrums and is made worse so by the summer holidays, and China, which has been the engine of growth in the past, remaining slow. In preparing our guidance we have done bottoms up analysis region-by-region, distributor-by-distributor and by major customers. We have also included Micrel revenue from today August 3rd to the end of the quarter as we understand it. We expect our net sales in the September quarter to be between $532 million to $569 million, includes [technical difficulty] revenue from the sales of Micrel products from today till the end of the quarter. Without counting Micrel, we expect our net sales to be between flat to down 7% sequentially.  I want to remind you that the guidance we are providing is for non-GAAP revenue which will include sell-through from the distributors of Micrel. The GAAP revenue will be much lower since GAAP does not account for products sold to distributors that were shipped prior to the acquisition effective date. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.6% to 57.8% for the combined company negatively impacted by the lower gross margin of Micrel and sequentially flat without Micrel. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be about 27.7% to 28.9% of sales for the combined company and we expect the combined company non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.7% to 30.1% of sales, again, negatively impacted by higher expenses and lower operating profit of Micrel. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.58 to $0.66 per share. The non-GAAP earnings per share impacted by $0.015 dilution coming from the consolidation of Micrel. Now let me provide you more updates on the Micrel acquisition. We closed the acquisition today and we now begin the hard work of integration to drive shareholder value. The shareholders of Micrel overwhelmingly approved the merger with 98.95% of the Micrel's shares that voted in the favor of the merger. As part of the transaction, we will pay an aggregate of approximately $430 million in cash and issue an aggregate of 8,626,795 shares. Taking into consideration the equity awards assumed and the cash and investments on Micrel, the balance sheet at the closing date, the total enterprise value is in line with the $744 million that we shared with investors when we announced the signing of the definitive agreement back on May 7, 2015. Now Ganesh has already covered some of the elements of our integration planning, I will cover four areas. First, I will explain to you how the revenue of Micrel will be consolidated into Microchip's SEC revenue reporting. Second, I will explain our plans in the IT systems and manufacturing area. Third, I will give you guidance on the accretion we expect to get from this acquisition. And finally, I will provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. So let us begin with how the revenue of Micrel will be included in the Microchip's revenue reporting. Micrel breaks down its revenue into three reported product lines, linear and power solutions, LAN solutions and TCG, which is timing and communication. 99% of Micrel revenue will be reported as analog revenue within Microchip. Approximately 1% of Micrel revenue is on products that are built on a microcontroller core. They are in fact special purpose microcontrollers and will be reported within our microcontroller revenue.  Now I will give you update on our integration planning in the IT systems area and in the manufacturing area. In the last three months, we have studied the business systems of both companies. Micrel is a small company and its business systems are relatively old. We have laid out a plan that will transfer all of Micrel to Microchip's business systems. We estimate that this transition will be completed sometime in the calendar first quarter of 2016.  Regarding manufacturing, Micrel operates a small 6 inch fab in San Jose, there is about 30% utilize at the current time. Micrel also uses outside foundries for some of its products, mostly for the LAN solutions group. These happen to be some of the same foundries that Microchip uses for some of our products that are outsourced. We will leave those products running in the outside fabs. Our focus will be to deal with 6 inch San Jose fab that is severely underutilized. Microchip will transfer all of Micrel's products from its 6 inch fab to other facilities. A majority of these products will transfer to Microchip's two 8 inch fabs, one in Tempe Arizona and second in Gresham, Oregon, some products maybe transfer to other outside foundries, wherever there is a better process technology match. We believe that that this transfer of all the products from Micrel fab to either Microchip fab, or to some foundries will take about one to two years, after that San Jose 6 inch fab will be closed. Regarding, backend manufacturing, Micrel's subcontracts 100% of its assembly and test. Many of the packages that Micrel uses are different than Microchips but many are same. Where appropriate, we will apply our extended purchasing power to lower our supply chain cost, as in the other acquisitions we will also do a careful make versus buy analysis on each package and product type, over time some of the products and packages maybe broad into our assembly and test facility, while others will remain at the sub-contractors. Microchip will however combined and manufacturing systems, like wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses. We expect that all Micrel products will be shipping from Microchip's manufacturing system by the end of the first calendar quarter of 2016. With this let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. We currently expect the Micrel acquisition to be $0.015 to dilutive to a non-GAAP EPS for the partial September quarter. The acquisition just closed today. So we need more time to study and provide you further guidance but with the rate at which we expect the integration to progress. Our initial estimate will be that Micrel acquisition will be breakeven to our December quarter non-GAAP EPS. For longer term, after we have closed the San Jose fab, which is about one to two years from now, we expect Micrel to add about $0.25 off accretion to Microchips yearly non-GAAP EPS. These numbers are preliminary and depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general. Finally, let me provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. Our track record have shown that Microchip has been able to improve the business model of its acquisition and our combined business model has remained virtually unchanged, If thereafter San Jose fab is closed and the older 6 inch inventory has been depleted, we will improve the financial model of Micrel to be equivalent to that of Microchip. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates through first call.  With this operator, will you please call for questions?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. 
Craig Hettenbach: Thanks. Starting first with just that industry question, Steve, if I look at the current environment today, what’s your sense the biggest difference between today versus last fall, when there was also at that time, I'll albeit a brief correction.
Stephen Sanghi: Craig, I was hoping that, this question could wait some time at least later, that's a first question. So, let's take it. As the earning season has progressed a number of investors and analyst have commented and have asked me, how I thought about the current environment in the semiconductor and if this is something that Saturday in October of last year, with our earnings warning at that time, I have not engaged into any conversation within any of the investors and analyst, because we were in the quite time. Then I thought, if the question was asked, shall I address it here, so here it is, it's really the first question. And while it’s really painful to visit that period again, we do believe that the first signs of its slowdown in China, were visible at that time. We saw that through thousands of small customers, who were experiencing the economic headwinds and not buying enough products. This was further, enhanced by a very tight credit environment that was prevalent at that time in China, then after a warning, the December quarters numbers for most semiconductor companies were cut by an average of about 5%. The company is in the supply chain of one mobile customer where a notable exception. Now then came the March quarter, which was seasonally weak for most companies due to Chinese New Year and also some others blamed it on Euro weakness, which was indeed a new phenomenon.  Then came in the June quarter which is traditionally a very strong quarter in China and we saw a broad based miss from the industry led by China and the September quarter guidance has been very weak also driven by China. Now we have semiconductor companies admitting that there was indeed inventory build in China and in the distribution that needs to correct. We knew from the companies that we have acquired and others that we conducted diligence on but did not acquired that there was a broad based selling driven inventory build in distribution channel which the prevailing rate of demand could not support. You can only play a selling gain for so long and this time it can truly went a bit longer. But now everyone’s numbers have been cut significantly, a large number of companies are now selling well below the stock prices on October 9th prior to our call, when I said I quote “we believe that another industry correction has begun and that this correction will be seen more broadly across the industry in the near future. But it probably took a quarter longer than it has taken historically, likely mached by the smartphone supply chain with everyone having some exposure to it. But really in answer to investor and analyst question, I see yes this is pretty much a continuation of the phenomena that we saw last October.
Craig Hettenbach: Just a quick follow up to that before have an additional question. Just the comment on China remained slow, how would you kind of frame just the environment in China? Do you think we’re through most of the inventory correction and it will attract demand or any additional quotes in China for Q3?
Ganesh Moorthy: We’re not through all the inventory corrections, no. There will again be differences in sell in versus sell through also, all of our revenue is sell through. But we bought Micrel today which had a mixture of sell-in and sell-through with most of China being sell-in which will be converting to sell-through only recognizing sell-through, so there are number of moving parts in our business. But industry still has a lot of inventory in China.
Craig Hettenbach: And then just a follow up on Micrel, appreciate the thoughts in terms of how you expect to transform the business, particularly in manufacturing. On the product side given that you had a little bit of time in talking to customers, any anecdotes of feedback in terms of their product portfolio and how you see that kind of best fit within Microchip?
Ganesh Moorthy: We have decided to take linear and power solutions business which was the largest division inside of Micrel and completely fold that within Microchip which is happening starting today. So essentially we have taken our analog business and internally in Microchip’s split it into two portions, one is called the analog power and interface division and second is called the mix signal and linear division, both about equal size and then the entire Micrel linear and power business is folding into one of those division which is the analog power management business. So, we will apply our principles, our metrics of R&D and all that. When I look at R&D as a percentage of sales for analog, Microchip is one of the most efficient in the industry, we don’t breakout into visual R&D, but the amount of R&D we spend to get the margins and revenue and all there and Micrel is one of the worst when you look at the numbers. So we have to move this from worst to best. And we have done that with others, we’ve done that with SSC and SMSC and Supertex and over and over and over, we have team there, that’s what we have to do here. Then there is LAN business here which is about $50 million, $60 million and that also we’re going to completely fold that into Microchip’s USB and Networking Division where our LAN business resides, that again will then really benefit from our methodologies, our metrics, our management and everything else. And the third business here is the timing business, which is a new business for us and we will keep that as a business unit but if you’re reporting to one of our seasoned general manager so he can also get the mentorship and really move towards our model.
Operator: We’ve move next to William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein: Steve based on the tenure [ph] of what now you’re describing as three or four quarter downturn. And the order of linearity that you are seeing maybe in the calendar second quarter and into July and now August, I am wondering if you can provide any view as to when you think demand normalizes?
Steve Sanghi: I think, I resigned from the forecasting business last year, you might recall that in November. I am not going to make that comment looking forward for the industry. If we just look at ourselves, we think we gave you September quarter guidance already, December [technical difficulty] is seasonally a weak quarter for Microchip and really also for the industry. Considering this correction happening in June and September, what would manifest for December, it's kind of hard to see right now. But as we go through the quarter, one could make a guess that December quarter should not seasonally be weak because ordinarily December quarter is followed by a very strong June and September. This time it is not. But I am not making that prediction today. I got to see the quarter. I got to see the bookings, the backlog, everything else and talk about it later maybe as we go on the road. The biggest leverage here short-term is really improving Micrel's business and I think there is a fair amount of opportunity for us to do that, and largest leverage comes from the fab. There is 30% utilization in the fab and we dramatically lower its cost by transferring product and the first five products will be running out of Microchip's fab in about six weeks.
William Stein: That's great. Steve, I appreciate that. Maybe I can use that as sort of the next question. So after completing this deal and understanding that all the synergies and all the work is still in front of you, I wondering if you can characterize the current appetite for a future M&A,? It certainly helps dull the pain from the current demand environment a little bit. And I am wondering how much appetite there is for more of that though? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Well, we have substantial line in place, which we did that earlier in February. And we have constantly -- a good of number of companies in our funnel that we are constantly talking to, dating with, analyzing and there's no guarantee, these things are not schedulable at any given point in time, and sometime it takes longer for a deal to materialize, other time it's shorter. But yes, we still have appetite for the next acquisition, no question about it.
Operator: We'll move next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. 
John Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess Steve, Ganesh and Eric, I was wondering if get a little more detail about kind of the actions you are taking around utilization rates in your own fabs, I am kind of curious, do you think September will represent the trough, I guess Steve given your comments about uncertainty around December, but possibly a scenario where December is a little bit better than normal seasonal weak. Does that mean that, that most of the utilization action is behind you or how should I think about that? And Eric remind me again how that flows through the gross margin?
Steve Sanghi: Well, let me comment on the utilization. First of all, the Gresham factory in Oregon is a newer factory and in a newer factory we need a -- once in a five years we need a major shutdown to repair things that can't be repaired while the factory is running. And that shut down has been previously scheduled for a year for this October and that shutdown usually is about seven to eight days you have to shut the factory and we reserve for it going into that shutdown, and it's planned shutdown, we have to do it every once in a five years. We are currently planning to tack on a few more days to it to bring the inventory down because the factory will be shut down anyway and rather than starting and staffing it will be best to extend that a little bit. Then the factory in Tempe is a much older facility and doesn’t have as many redundancies built into it and the Tempe facility [technical difficulty] we always do that in December, over the holidays. So this time again we will have a shutdown in Tempe facility over the holidays and we are planning to tack on a few more days to that to correct our inventory. So you will see our internal inventory rise in the September quarter, but then it corrects because we got shutdowns in both factories in the December quarter.  The normal shutdown, we accrue it over four quarters, balance over the year but the extra shutdown days we're going to do will charge it to the current quarter. Basically in the quarter it happens which will be the calendar Q4. So Q4 gross margin would be impacted, I don’t know whether Eric is able to dollarize it at this point in time and whether it will GAAP or non-GAAP that would be a one-time phenomenon.
Eric Bjornholt: Yes, and I think Steve you've answered John's question and I don’t -- at this point in time we're not willing to give guidance for December quarter gross margin. So I will leave it at that.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful guys. Maybe as my follow up for Steve and Ganesh. Steven and Ganesh, we tend to like to sometimes compare apples-to-oranges here on Wall Street. We look at your microcontroller business and often time compare that don’t have sort of 8 bit part of the business and might be a relatively new entrant. And I guess I am trying to think about kind of your relative growth rate of microcontrollers versus your peers. Is the right way for us to think about this as given your breadth in 8 bit perhaps you are more cyclical in these parts of the cycle? And if that's the case, maybe Ganesh you can give us some metrics around 16 bits and 31 bits that make you guys comfortable that you are at least maintaining if not gaining share in those segments in the market?
Steve Sanghi: So we don’t breakout 16 bit and 32 bit as you may recall from about two to three quarters ago but we did present in April, where the market share results were and we had significant growth in market-share in each of 8 bit, 16 bit and 32 bit. So we look at the market as a continuum off solutions that I needed in many cases an 8 bit is good enough, in some cases it's a 16 bit and in another cases it's 32 bit. And we see growth opportunities in all three of them both in terms of the applications and the markets that they can go into. So our view is that that is growth that is taking place and then there is growth yet to be had in all three segments we’re not looking at 8 bit to save us or 32 bit to save us or 16 bit to save us all three of them we expect will grow.
Operator: And next we’ll take Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Chris Caso: The question is -- like first question is on Micrel and you talk about $0.25 of accretion over one or two years, could you give us some help in determining how much of that perhaps we might see a bit earlier and how much of that would have to wait? Your comment said that much of this I guess the majority of this comes in the fab closer and I assume that is sometime we have to wait for little bit or perhaps there is some near-term accretion as you start to control some of the OpEx?
Ganesh Moorthy : So there is near-term accretion, I don’t know if I have a breakdown considering we’re closing the acquisition just today before that all we had model and then we have quickly verified some stuff. But if you give us little more time maybe as we get on the road and see you at some conferences or the next conference call or we can have much more intelligent numbers for you. But there is accretion coming from expense reduction and other thing that prior to that it's not all from fab.
Chris Caso: And just with -- just kind of a follow-up on the market conditions as well and I am sure you heard from some others there was -- I guess there have been some different commentary regarding the pace of bookings through the quarter kind of how things have started in the quarter in the month of July, wondering if you can give some clarity on that, plus linearity from the June quarter, how July has gotten started and if that’s giving you some incremental optimism or pessimism as you look forward?
Ganesh Moorthy : I listened to some of the calls and it's amazing how the customer’s been placing bookings are kind of behaving almost same for everybody and I could say the same team that, this quarter’s bookings look better than it was last quarter and there was some strength in the overall numbers. But that’s baked into the guidance and I think if you look at various people’s commentary last quarter, April was good and May was good and then June fell off. So I think people make these adjustments through the quarter and better a July doesn’t necessarily mean better end of September for us or anybody else because customers can correct that anytime in the quarter. Sometime people place bookings earlier, so whatever product they need for the quarter they have commitment from the supplier that they will get the product for their needs and then easy for them to cancel or slip it out, that I don’t needed in September, give it to me in October then to have a situation where they don’t place the order and September quarter comes and needs something and somebody’s lead time is more than four weeks and they can’t get it. So customer seem to have very little penalty for getting their queue in line, almost no penalty. So therefore, it's not unusual for the first quarter sometime to see stronger bookings only to get corrected later on. And I would not reach so much into it for anybody.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll move to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin Cassidy: Going back to the Micrel fab and shutting that down, you gave data point that five products have moved. Can you say, what is the determination between getting it closed in one-year to two years? Is it customer qualifications or finding other fabs that can manufacturer?
Steve Sanghi : So that’s a good question. So we bought Supertex on April 1, 2014 and we closed the Supertex fab in April of 2015 took us about 13 months and that fab was much smaller than Micrel fab is, Micrel fab is larger, it's a larger company than Supertex. But we learned a lot doing Supertex and we were able to do that in 13 months. So we’re mounting a much larger team and we’re going to transfer the products at more than twice the rate than actually we transferred the products from Supertex fab into and the basic difference between whether it's a year or two years is, sub-types [ph] of customers, the products from the new fab, products coming out of fab and working first time and you have retreat it, running into any kind of equipment issues, equipments and fabs seem to be different, we believe we can emulate Micrel’s process on our equipment and we are successful in the first couple of processes we are attempting so far. But at any point in time you could run into a challenge and have to then convert a Micrel piece of equipment from 6 inch to 8 inch or buy a new one and have three, four, five months delay in getting that equipment. So there are lot of unknowns, lot of unknowns, that’s why we gave this band of a year to two year. My desire is 11 months, but I don’t get everything I desire, I think it's going to be somewhere between one to two years.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay, maybe just, maybe some unknown also but is there a chance that there would be some products you can't manufacture somewhere else and they would be discontinued and maybe not get the full revenue Micrel had?
Steve Sanghi: Well, no, so what we do is, there always -- especially in analog there lots of products that needs one fab run every two years. And those products don’t make sense to even having mask set, and put the cost of transferring it. So usually on those mask set we build strategic inventory of four years so. So if the product needs a one run a year then you run four runs out of the Micrel fab before you shut it down, now you have four years customer demand, then you've four years to figure it out what are you going to do with it? I build it into our fab or take it to a subcontractor, transfer the equipment, do whatever. So that's what we will do. That's not going to hold up the fab.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay.
Steve Sanghi: And Micrel is a small company as a percentage of Microchips. So even though there will be a strategic transition inventory build on the products we are transferring in and on the products we are not transferring. The products we are transferring here to build some strategic inventory on those too because you got to give the customer time to qualify 8 inch material while they have 6 inch material available, so you will see that strategic inventory build on our balance sheet. But it's not going to be that large compared to the size of the company and it's strategic in nature.
Operator: We will move next to Gil Alexander with Darfield Associates. 
Gilbert Alexander: Hi. Thank you. My question has been answered.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you Gil.
Operator: Thank you. We will take Chris Danley with Citi.
Chris Danley: Hey. Thanks guys. I guess just one quick clarification on what you are seeing in terms of your guidance. So I think as the other Chris said some of the competitors are saying that business is getting better. So are you, implicate in your guidance, are you assuming that your business is going to get a little worse or just kind of remain at this level throughout the quarter?
Steve Sanghi: I don’t know if I can decipher anymore, Chris. I mean our business in September quarter based on guidance is worse than last quarter and so is everybody else's. So far the guidance I have seen, their guidance for September is worse than what they accomplished in June. So they've got a little bit spurt in bookings, I saw the spurt in bookings, also in July, my [indiscernible] customers trying to lockup their place in line for September, not any different by -- for us versus anybody else. So I wouldn’t read anything more than that.
Chris Danley: Okay. Great. And then my follow up just a couple of things on, Micrel. Is there any way you could quantify the benefit from shutting down their fab and then in the December quarter what sort of revenue should we assume from Micrel because I believe you guys will be incorporating two quarters -- excuse me two months of it in this quarter. Anything you could talk about in terms of your planned OpEx reductions for Micrel in the December as well?
Steve Sanghi: I think it’s supposed to give that considering the deal closed two hours ago, so probably just be a little more patient. I think I could even do a better job two weeks from now, but not today. We are cutting expenses. We are letting number of people go as we are merging these divisions there is some high level senior leadership that we do not need. So we're making those changes and we got to dollarize it. We are unable to give you December quarter Micrel guidance, Micrel revenue has been falling for four years and recently has fallen a little harder. And we need to understand that. We need to meet with the distributors. We need to see what Microchip's sales force can do. So I don’t quite trust the guidance that I am hearing from them. So therefore I am not able to give December guidance on it yet.
Chris Danley: So can tell us if it was in the June quarter, the revenues for Micrel?
Steve Sanghi: Well I think the June quarter really wasn’t announced because the acquisition closed and I am not sure I am in a position to say that.
Chris Danley: Okay. That’s fine. Thanks.
Operator: We'll move next to Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.
Rajvindra Gill: Steve I was wondering if you can maybe elaborate further on the China weakness. Specifically, which segments or which verticals are you seeing the weakness in, I know there's been -- when you talked about China being weak back in October, you had mentioned the industrial vertical, wondering if that has spread to other verticals within China and any color there would be helpful?
Steve Sanghi: I think China is weak across the board exactly what it was in October, I don’t remember Microchip has been having industrial and I said we believe that another industry correction has begun. This correction will be seen broadly across the industry in the near future and the verbiage led by China, so I’m not sure whether it could be more industrial, but not only industrial. It’s really not that much different than it was back then. China is weak across the Board.
Rajvindra Gill: And if you could talk about the competitive landscape in the microcontroller market, you have obviously a big pending merger that will be closing in Q4. That merger the combine entity will become one of the largest microcontroller suppliers in the world both from the 8 bit and 32 bit side and a huge player in the automotive market. So I want to get a sense from you how you’re viewing the competitive landscape going forward given these changes in the market share and M&A that’s occurring?
Steve Sanghi: I think if you scan our history of 25 years we began with nothing and competing with some of the largest microcontroller manufacturers in U.S., Europe, Asia and Japan. When we were $100 million microcontroller business we competed with people who had billion, Freescale and NXP and Renesas and others. So I am not sure scale is necessarily a total advantage. We have won that through our disciplined approach to developing products, to running a very responsible P&L, having a high margin business. We go to market totally different than other people do other people try to seek very large chunks of business that very-very large OEMs which are offering at lower margin and not sticky and our model is at a 100,000 customers, no single customer is larger than 1.5% of our business. So, it’s not necessary that our business is always in the same places. And Renesas hasn’t been able to stop us in years, Freescale hasn’t been able to stop us and they were 100 times larger and them merging with NXP doesn’t really change in IoT for us. I don’t go -- the data deal closes I don’t go to work any different than I did the day before.
Rajvindra Gill: And just last question on IoT. Wondering how you’re thinking about that market in terms of your competitive position and assembling the building blocks to address the market. And any color in terms of how the intensity of the activity of IoT at your customer base, is that really picking up or is it going to take some time to take off? Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: Everybody say that and people don’t kind of wake up a numbers nor do we and everybody is putting different stuff into IoT, so it’s kind of very hard to compare it’s wild west. But all make the claim that we have the strongest IoT franchise. You need intelligent microcontrollers, you need RF building blocks, you need Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Bluetooth Light, RF, Zigbi. We have all of them. You need various ecosystems with software and stacks and middleware and all that. We have all that. And we have significant number of cloud partners where you have to ping off to often connect with equipment or whatever. We have the strongest building blocks of anybody. We’re seeing companies that will take all of their microcontroller business combine it with sensors of something and petition that as an IoT business while you could do that. But if a PC is connected to a printer and then microcontroller in that chain, it’s not really IoT. But it’s connected and you can call it IoT, and so I think we gave you a little summary last quarter remember.
Eric Bjornholt: I think we said our IoT business was about $275 million annualized growing at a 35% compounded annual growth rate and really to more narrowly define it to be where there is both smart and connected application.
Rajvindra Gill: So this is a microcontroller attached with some sort of connectivity to it, is that how you’re going to [Multiple Speakers].
Steve Sanghi: [Multiple Speakers] IoT, so it’s really where you truly making an RF connection using it as a Wi-Fi or a Bluetooth or a Zigbi --.
Eric Bjornholt: Or could be Ethernet to it if it’s wired, so its microcontrollers, it’s analog, its memory and its connectivity, all those solutions put together with the software frame work that Steve talked about with security built into it and an ecosystem of third parties that allow the connection to the cloud. So it is an important market, it is one in which we have -- historically had significantly strength because all the companies before you can connect have to have something that is smart. And if you want something that is smart microcontrollers and analog are at the heart of building smart devices.
Operator: That does conclude our question-answer-session. At this time, I’ll turn the call back over to our speakers for any final or additional comments.
Steve Sanghi: Well, thank you very much, we are going to couple of conferences this year and next conference would be?
Eric Bjornholt: We’ll be at the Jefferies 101 conference in Chicago in late August and then the Citi conference in New York in I think September 8th or 9th.
Steve Sanghi: And by that time we may have more understanding of Micrel may be able to tell you more. So I'd love to see you at one of those conferences. Thank you.
Operator: And everyone that does conclude our conference call for today. Thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Microchip's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Sanghi: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. As you know, in addition to earnings, we also announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Micrel. During this conference call, we will not cover anything in relations to the acquisition and we'll take your questions only related to the earning. After we conclude this conference call, you will have to dial in to the second conference call where we will cover matters related to the acquisition and take your questions. The second conference call has to be filed with the SEC, hence the separation of 2 conference calls. The second call will begin at 5:45 p.m. Eastern Time. With that, let me now pass this call to our Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt.
James Eric Bjornholt: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In addition to Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO, is also participating in this call. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of our operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record $547.2 million and were modestly above the midpoint of our guidance, which was $546.6 million, and were up 10.9% from the March 2014 quarter. Revenue by product line in the March quarter was $353.6 million for microcontrollers, $127.6 million for analog, $33.2 million for memory, $23.6 million for licensing and $9.2 million of other. Revenue by geography was $106.2 million in the Americas, a record $126 million in Europe and $314.9 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at the midpoint of our guidance at 58.3% in the March quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 25.9% of sales, well below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 32.4% of sales and net income was $148.8 million. This resulted in record earnings of $0.68 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our guidance. For fiscal 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $2.161 billion and up 11.9% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58.8%, operating expenses were 26.4% of sales and operating income was 32.4% of sales. Net income was a record $593.9 million or $2.66 per diluted share. GAAP net sales in the March quarter were $543.2 million, and as originally guided, were $4 million lower than non-GAAP net sales due to the contractual relationship change we made with the ISSC distribution network to move them to a sell-through revenue recognition model in the December quarter. The revenue impact from this change was fully recognized as of the end of March and will not create a GAAP to non-GAAP revenue difference in future quarters. On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 57.7% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins included the impact of $2 million of share-based compensation, $1.8 million of gross profit on the ISSC revenue recognition change previously mentioned and $1.5 million in manufacturing shutdown costs associated with the Supertex wafer fab in San Jose. Total operating expenses were $203.3 million or 37.4% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $47.1 million, share-based compensation of $13.2 million, $0.7 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $0.8 million. GAAP other expense includes a $50.6 million loss on the retirements of 50% of our 2,037 convertible bonds and an $18.5 million gain on the sale of a portion of investments that Microchip acquired as part of the SST acquisition back in 2010. GAAP net income was $99.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $26.7 million, which were primarily driven by the closure of a tax audit and the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain previously established tax reserves. For fiscal year 2015, GAAP net sales were a record $2.147 billion. Gross margins were 57.3%, operating expenses were 37.4% of sales and operating income was 19.8% of sales. Net income was $369 million or $1.65 per diluted share. In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.4%. The GAAP tax benefit rate was 58.9%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $26.7 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before and the tax impact of certain of the one-time events in the quarter. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.75% to 11.25%. To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the March quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.217, share-based compensation was about $0.052, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.121, a favorable difference on the sale of a portion of investments acquired in the SST acquisition was about $0.084, the loss on the retirement of our 50% of our 2,037 convertible bonds was about $0.144, the difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP noncontrolling interest in ISSC was a favorable of about $0.05 and noncash interest expense was about $0.019. The dividend declared today of $35.75 per share will be paid on June 4, 2015, to shareholders of record on May 21, 2015. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $72.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 51st consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 45th occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividends paid amount to over $2.5 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. During the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, including the stock that we bought back with the issuance of our convertible debenture back in 2008. Our cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is over $3.9 billion. Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at March 31, 2015, was $279.5 million or 111 days, flat to the levels at the end of the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors increased by 1 day in the March quarter and are at 37 days. I want to remind you that our distribution revenues throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We intend to grow the days of inventory on our balance sheet in the June quarter to support our business growth and customer service levels. The cash generation in the March quarter, excluding the purchase of additional shares of ISSC, our dividend payment, changes in cash from the issuance and retirement of our convertible debentures and changes in borrowing levels under revolving line of credit was $155.5 million. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.34 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $462 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $160 million to $180 million in the June quarter. Capital spending was approximately $29.4 million for the March quarter and $149.5 million for fiscal year 2015. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $160 million as we are adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that we are currently outsourcing. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $25 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was up 8.4% in the March quarter from the year-ago quarter. For fiscal year 2015, our microcontroller business was up 11.4% over fiscal year 2014, crossing the $1.4 billion mark for the first time and setting an all-time record. Also for fiscal year 2015, each of our 3 microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, set revenue records. Microcontrollers represented 64.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. As we mentioned in our January conference call, for competitive reasons, we will only be providing overall microcontroller revenue and growth rates and not break out by segment, consistent with the practice of most of our competitors. Gartner Dataquest just released their microcontroller market share report for 2014. We are pleased to report that Microchip has regained the #1 position for 8-bit microcontrollers. Four years ago, it took the merger of 3 Japanese semiconductor giants, NEC, Hitachi and Mitsubishi, in the form of Renesas to knock us off the #1 spot for 8-bit microcontrollers. We assured you at that time that we would work relentlessly to gain market share and to wrest back the #1 spot in the coming years. Post their merger, Renesas' 8-bit microcontroller business in 2010 used to be 41% larger than ours. In every year since 2010, we have closed the gap versus Renesas, and in 2014, we wrested back the leadership position and finished 10.5% larger than Renesas. In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we were again the fastest-growing 16-bit microcontroller supplier among the top 10 suppliers in 2014, growing at over 2x the rate of any of the other top 10 suppliers. While our substantially faster growth rate closed the gap versus higher-rank suppliers, we remained in the #5 spot in 2014 and expect to continue to gain share and move further up the rankings in the coming years. In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we moved up to the #9 spot in 2014 from the #11 spot in 2013, continuing our relentless climb up the rankings since we entered this market a few years ago. Now, Gartner Dataquest's report is a backward-looking indicator where we are performing very well. Now to look at a forward-looking indicator. In April also, UBM Tech, which is the parent company of EE Times, released the results of their annual Embedded Market Study. Once again, Microchip was rated by the embedded system design engineers as their #1 choice for new designs using 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers in the performance range that we compete in, and we were the #2 choice among 32-bit microcontrollers. We are humbled and gratified by the overwhelming preference by engineers for our solutions and see this as a positive sign of future growth. Our overall microcontroller results as well as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit results are clearly outperforming the market, with year-over-year growth rates well above the market and what we've seen reported by our competitors in their results. These outstanding results in a very competitive market are a tribute to the tireless effort by the worldwide Microchip team. We have gained significant market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Analog products. Our analog business was up 18.7% from the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2015, our analog business was up 17.6% over fiscal year 2014, crossing the $0.5 billion mark for the first time and also setting an all-time record. This business continues to have strong design win momentum in a broad range of applications and represented 23.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. Now moving to the memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products. This business was up 0.2% versus the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2015, our memory business was down 1.8% versus fiscal year 2014. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.1% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. I have one more topic to cover today. Given the importance of the Internet of Things market, some of our investors and analysts have asked for more color about the size of our IoT business. First, there is no consistent way in which semiconductor companies report their IoT revenue. As a result, there are some who report their entire embedded market revenue or the revenue of business units focused on the embedded market as IoT revenue. By that measure, pretty close to 100% of Microchip's $2.2 billion of revenue could be classified as IoT revenue, but it would not be as meaningful to investors in terms of its potential as a future growth driver. We have a stricter definition for our IoT revenue in that we only count end applications or things that are both smart and connected reflecting what the promise of IoT really is, which is the possibilities that open up by adding connectivity to smart systems. Examples of smart and connected applications for Microchip are things like alarm systems, access control systems, thermostats, smoke detectors, exercise machines, asset tracking, wireless audio docks, set-top boxes and other consumer electronic systems, hospital personnel locators, patient monitors, automotive telematics, building automation, vending machines, Smart Grid monitoring, wired and wireless networking systems, GPS navigation tracking systems and many, many others that are too numerous to list. More applications will continue to be added as they get connected. I'm sure you will agree that applications like the examples we just provided, which are a combination of smart and connected applications, are more real IoT applications and the products going into them would better characterize our IoT revenue. Microchip solutions that enable the IoT market include low-power microcontrollers, analog, sensors, memories, wired and wireless communication products. So using our stricter definition for IoT revenue, Microchip estimates that our current annual IoT revenue is approximately $275 million and has been growing at a greater than 35% compounded annual growth rate over the last 3 years. This revenue is already included in the public reporting segments for Microchip. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Stephen Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 and fiscal year 2015 then I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. We were very pleased with our execution in the March quarter. We achieved record net sales in the March quarter and slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 was a record and at the high end of our revised estimates. Recall that we had revised our earnings per share higher after taking into account the accretive effect of our financing transactions. Looking at the fiscal year 2015. It was another record year for revenue and the first fiscal year to cross the $2 billion revenue mark. For fiscal year 2015, revenue came in at a record $2.16 billion, up 11.9% from fiscal year 2014. All of our strategic product lines of microcontroller and analog posted record revenue performance for fiscal year 2015. The March quarter was also our 98th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 98 consecutive profitable quarters. We're also planning a celebration for our 100th consecutive profitable quarter, which is 2 quarters away. In the last 2 conference call, we told you that we will be shutting down production in Supertex, San Jose fab as well as test facility in Hong Kong. The San Jose fab is now closed with the last wafer outs occurring in early April. The fab building is undergoing restoration to be returned back to the landlord. The transfer of the Hong Kong test operations to our high-volume Thailand facility was also completed in February. Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. As we look at the business environment, it is clear that many of our industry peers are seeing weakness across various end markets including PC and industrial, slowing growth in China market and currency impacts from the strong dollar. Taking all this into account, we believe that our net sales in the June quarter will be between $547 million and $564 million. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.3% and 58.5% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 25.75% and 26% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 32.3% and 32.75% of sales, and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.69 and $0.73 per share. Finally, I want to remind you that given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call. Before we open it up for questions, I want to remind everybody, in case somebody joined the conference late, that in this conference call, we'll be only taking questions regarding our earnings and we'll have a second conference call starting at 5:45 p.m. New York time, at which we will talk about the Micrel acquisition and take questions related to that acquisition. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Steve, the guidance, a couple percentage points below consensus and perhaps normal seasonal patterns. Understanding that that's not out of line with what other companies are guiding this season as well, I wonder if you can comment on whether you see that small weakness extending further in the next quarter. You often have some strong opinions on the cycle and we -- I think we'd like to hear them.
Stephen Sanghi: I have blocked my opinion on the cycle. I'm not going to share with you anymore. Basically, I think as far as the seasonality is concerned, a company with a constant stream of acquisitions that we have done, we believe seasonality often is miscalculated by the investors depending on how many years back you go. We have had Supertex acquisition, which closed in April last year; ISSC acquisition last year. If you go 5 years back, we closed SST acquisition also in April. So when you look at the June quarter numbers, sometimes you do with or without acquisitions and many times, the breakdown of those numbers is not available 2 or 3 years out. So I believe that seasonality changes a lot with these acquisitions. And I think -- but the largest reason is you describe yourself, which is industry conditions are soft, just like announced by other peers. That's what we are seeing and beyond that I'm not going to comment on cycle or anything else for the future.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. I understand that. If I can ask 1 follow-up, please. Wonder to what degree do you see this -- the weakness as FX related, either sort of first order or second order effect and whether there are any end markets, you were good enough to call out IoT. I think historically you haven't done a lot of talking about specific end markets. But is there 1 particular end market like either PC or wireless infrastructure that may be weaker or stronger?
Stephen Sanghi: So we don't really have much end market commentary. We serve 90,000-plus customers and a vast majority of them through distribution and many time, at the customers, we work with multiple divisions. For some of them the business is PCs. For some others the business is industrial. For some other it could be called consumer. So we don't really have any end market flavor. But Ganesh, in his commentary, described that our IoT business, the way we defined it, much narrower definition of IoT for applications that are really smart and connected, is growing 35% a year. So that's doing very well. But if you take a broader definition of IoT like include all the embedded business and all that, you could almost call 100% of Microchip's business as IoT, which really would not be helpful. So that's really what I have to say there.
James Eric Bjornholt: I think the question was on FX.
Stephen Sanghi: FX, I don't really think we can delineate the effects that much. But we do business worldwide in U.S. dollars, so 99% plus of our business will be in U.S. dollars. So we don't take a hit on our receivables that way, and when the currencies become weak overseas, it doesn't change our revenue right away because our prices are in dollars. But then it makes the products more expensive for our customers. So as you're renegotiating the price, the next bid comes in, next order comes in, you're negotiating and then you will see some impact. But doing it in dollars gives us more control, allows us to manage it, split it with the customer or do whatever, but really allows us to manage it rather than have an automatic [ph] full FX impact to drop down. So I think the way we do it is probably better and has a delayed effect. It also impacts the business of our customers. If a business of our customers includes lots of products from overseas, which in most cases it does, then their end product becomes more expensive and they're having more trouble in terms of ramping their own products. So those results are real. Some are first tier, some are second tier, some are even third tier and it's very hard to figure this out with 90,000 customers worldwide doing business in 100 countries and I don't think we can decipher that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: The first question is along the lines of currency also, but I noted that your business in Europe appear to be very strong in the quarter. I wonder if you could talk about that a bit. I didn't know if perhaps there were some currency related effects in there, perhaps having an effect on customer demand in the quarter. I guess, was that European strength surprising to you? And just generally, what would you think may be behind that?
Stephen Sanghi: Go ahead, Eric.
James Eric Bjornholt: So Chris, if you look back at our historical results, the March quarter is always a strong period in Europe and you're having growth of almost 19%. It was a really good quarter in Europe, but that's not out of the line with what we've seen historically. And so with the FX rates really changing kind of late 2014, early 2015, the impact on the quarter, from an FX standpoint, was not significant in the March quarter and Steve talked about what the forward effects could be. But it's always a very strong quarter in March in Europe and this quarter was no different.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. Great. Just as a follow-up, I know you're trying to take inventory levels up. If you can remind us kind of where you're looking to take them, how long you think it's going to take to get there. And is there sort of a leverage benefit on margins as you do that?
Stephen Sanghi: I think we like our inventory. Product mix has gotten very complex. Today, a significant portion of our business is analog. Lots of our microcontrollers business is very analog-like. There's a high amount of analog on microcontrollers with lots and lots of SKUs. So we're basically finding that our inventory level needs to be between 115 and 120 days. A few years ago, we used to talk about 110 days. So I think it's gone up by about maybe 7 to 10 days to have a reasonable amount of inventory to be able to do business in such a complex mix of SKUs, and our inventory today is 111 days.
James Eric Bjornholt: 111 and we put in the release that we'd expect, based on the guidance for the quarter, for inventory to grow between 3 and 9 days. So take the middle of the road of that and we're kind of getting real close to what our model is for the longer term. So I think inventory is in pretty good shape.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just to follow up on the current environment given that the quarter itself came in line. Can you just talk about maybe how it progressed? And it looks like within the last 6 months, we've had a couple times a bit of a pause here. Just what you make of that from a demand or inventory perspective?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, in terms of how the quarter progressed, it was a very standard March quarter that starts slow with the new year holidays around the world then picks up some steam and then slows down into the Chinese New Year and then you have a [indiscernible] in March. It's probably the most back-end loaded quarter we do compared to June quarter, September quarter, December quarter. March quarter is the most back-end loaded, predominantly driven by the Chinese New Year and slow start in January, so very difficult.
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes, and I'd say that was within our expectations.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Any then -- any color in terms of just kind of canvassing the landscape from a demand and just some of the sluggish trends you're seeing out there?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, I hate to go back and visit last year, but late last year, the estimates for the industry were double-digit 10 percentile [ph]. And we were able to see that, that that's not doable. It just didn't look possible with what we were seeing in the PC, the inventory we were seeing in the channel and what we were hearing from our customers. We just didn't think the industry had a driver to really create another 10% growth year. And as you look at it now, the growth rate for the industry has been cut in half. So I really have to say that I'm not surprised. It's -- I think that's what we thought it will be.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe just a longer-term question. If you look across, you've been successful in really ramping the analog business as well as on the MCU side in terms of share gains over time. But just as you look at those 2 businesses, any differences for long-term growth rates in terms of which one you might think grow the fastest longer term?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, we're a very profitable company. As you can see, 32.3% operating profit. So our microcontroller and analog business is both very well funded and relatively independently. We're not driving to a model that 3 years out, exclusion of a business will be this division or that division. They're all well-funded and it depends on basically achieving product success and marketplace penetration and they meet in manufacturing and they meet at the customer base and they meet in application. Wherein the same application, we got lots of microcontroller as well as analog products going into a single board. So there is a lot of synergy that way. But in terms of making investments, there's not a competition because we can really take care of both. So it will largely depend on where we have larger success. Analog has been growing faster somewhat because that's where we have done some of the acquisitions. Microcontroller acquisitions are a bit more difficult to do because everybody has a different architecture and you got different issues in trying to get synergy in microcontroller. So we had been able to acquire capability in analog both organically and through acquisitions, and it has been a smaller business compared to the microcontrollers. Microcontroller is a $1.5 billion business and analog is about 1/3 of that, $0.5 billion. So it's been growing faster. But it's not something that we are -- if microcontroller can grow faster with IoT with other applications, 32-bit is going very fast, 16-bit is going very fast, 8-bit did a record, but it does have a $1.5 billion gorilla that has to move. And we are #3rd in the overall microcontroller market, third or fourth depending on which year you take, versus in analog, we are much lower. There are much, much larger analog companies that we can take share from for long time.
Operator: We'll continue on to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: On your CapEx plan for fiscal year '16, you said $160 million. Can you break it down a little bit? Is it front end or back end and just where the spending will be?
James Eric Bjornholt: So it's a combination of both, Kevin. We're continuing to invest in new processes and kind of technologies in both the front end and back end and investing to not only support the growth of our organic business, but then invest to bring some things in-house that were previously outsourced for acquisition. So kind of the same story that you've heard before, it is definitely a split between front-end manufacturing and back-end manufacturing.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Maybe to add on to that, what do you expect your split to be at the end of fiscal year '16 for internal versus outsourcing?
James Eric Bjornholt: So if you're meaning how much of our wafer fab will be done in-house, so in fiscal '15, about 39% of that was outsourced and 61% was done in-house. There'll be modest movements from that in fiscal '16, won't -- nothing will change dramatically.
Stephen Sanghi: Unless there is a large acquisition that moves the mix. From an organic basis, you can move 1 or 2 points a year or something. So it's not very huge. But significant movements had happened when we acquired SST, which was 100% outsourced; when acquired SMSC, that was 100% outsourced. You could ask that question in the second conference call on Micrel and maybe I can answer it there.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Yes, maybe what I was trying to get a feel for too is like I think with SMSC, the idea was to bring the test and packaging in-house even though the wafer fab was out. Is that still the longer-term idea to do more of your own testing and packaging?
Stephen Sanghi: Yes, so when we answered your question on 39% inside, it was not on a COGS basis. It was basically on a fab basis, front end. In terms of back end, we do...
James Eric Bjornholt: 88% of the test we do in-house and kind of high 50s, low 60% of assembly we do in-house and that moves around with the acquisitions as Steve noted.
Stephen Sanghi: Yes. So we have continued to bring work from SMSC inside. We have closed Supertex test facility in Hong Kong. All that is running into Microchip. So yes, case-by-case basis. When it runs outside, we try to bring it inside for lower cost.
Operator: Our next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Stephens.
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Steve, I was wondering if there were any bright spots in terms of end markets, some markets that actually held up better both as far as March as well as maybe for the guidance.
Stephen Sanghi: I think it's fashionable to say IoT. That's what I would say probably. That's -- it grew 35% year-over-year, and I'm sure it did very well quarterly, too.
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: That's fair. And then I think you, in response to a previous question, you had talked about linearity of the March quarter. We found that very helpful. I was wondering, not specific to this June quarter but historically, maybe you can give us an idea how typically the June quarter trends for you guys last couple of years.
Stephen Sanghi: In terms of monthly linearity?
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Yes, just any kind of color you want to give us.
Stephen Sanghi: We'll say June quarter is probably the most linear quarter. The March quarter is the most nonlinear quarter because of the Chinese New Year. Then when you get to September quarter, you have August, which is weak usually because of holidays in Europe and parts of Asia; and December quarter, you have holidays at the end. So June quarter is actually the most normal linear quarter, and I don't think we expect anything different.
Operator: And Chris Danely with Citi.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So I guess, if you just take a step back, can you compare this soft patch to what happened late last year or maybe even 2012, 2011? Do you think it's similar, better, worse? Do you think there's any chance that things could get worse? Or did we just kind of fall down a month ago or a few weeks ago and now we're kind of bouncing along the bottom and waiting for things back up? Any perspective there?
Stephen Sanghi: I think, Chris, I resigned from my industry forecasting job last year. Maybe could you...
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Good luck with that. I guess, as my follow-up, how about inventory out there with distributors and your customers now that demand is a little lower? Do you expect some sort of inventory burn this quarter? Or do you feel like everybody is pretty comfortable out there?
Stephen Sanghi: So I think our distribution inventory is not high. Number one, we don't take it as a revenue, so it doesn't really matter as much. But if the distribution inventory becomes too high and then they correct it, we can have a downstream effect than if we have to lower our own inventory. Our own inventory is in the lower side and we like it higher. The distribution inventory is in the middle. So when you combine those 2 inventories in that high, if anything, they're in the low side despite the weakness, despite the guidance. So based on current numbers, our inventory is still really on the south or the middle. So I don't think the inventory is a problem. We're working very hard in our factories to make more product for our customers and have expedites and challenges and others with the mix being very complex, having closed down Supertex fab, accommodating all those products in our fab. Manufacturing is challenging and inventory -- high inventory is not an issue right now.
Operator: And John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John William Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Do you mind I give my shot and try to bring you out of retirement and kind of follow up to Chris' first question? I'm just kind of curious, you're guiding flat up sequentially for the June quarter. A little bit below normal seasonal patterns, but you guys are comfortable enough to continue to build inventory. I'm just kind of curious, if you thought this was going to be prolonged or deeper, would you do anything around utilization? Would you not build inventories? The fact that you're willing to build some inventory, kind of a test inside, if you think this is more of a soft test than anything else?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, I mean, we really aren't making a call either way. I mean, our manufacturing is running normal. If you look at our December quarter, we have holiday related shutdown we have to do to really do the maintenance on the facilities. So you lose a few days, and it's usually tied on total output in December quarter, and in the March quarter you get the full days. And related to that, we're working hard to build a few days of inventory. We said 3 to 9 days. Let's see at the end it comes out to be 4 or 5 days. That would still be only 114, 115 days of inventory on the lower end of 115 to 119. So like I said, in answer to Chris' question, I don't really think we have conviction either way to drive the inventory much higher and much lower. We're largely basically trying to get to the middle of our range and only going to get to the bottom of our range probably.
John William Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: That's helpful, Steve. And then maybe as a follow-up, Ganesh, really appreciate the kind of the more detailed definition of IoT and you talked about a lot of the discrete IP and technology you guys provide. I'm kind of curious, to what extent you guys are providing that as a turnkey solution when you think about microcontroller, analog, wired/wireless connectivity? How do we think about kind of -- how much of your IoT revenue is complete turnkey solutions versus discrete? And what's the opportunity to go to turnkey? And if you could talk a little bit about security within that IoT bucket as well, because clearly, there's a school of thought that secure and connected is what defines IoT. I'd be kind of curious as to how you guys thinking about the security issue?
Ganesh Moorthy: Okay. Good questions. So when we go to market, there are obviously many customers for whom we can provide the complete bag of solutions: analog, microcontroller, wireless or wired, whatever connectivity they want to have. In other cases, we may only win a portion of that, and it gives us a foothold of the customer to come back and look at their next generation of designs. So I don't have a good split of which way it is across so many different customers there are. But our obvious go-to market is doing as much as what's on the board that constitutes both the smart side of the equation as well as the connectivity side of the equation. And your question on security is a very good one as well. So we know it's a key part of many, many of these applications. We enable that security, in some cases, through hardware that's built into our products in combination with software that we make available as well. And I think there's a lot more coming in front of us from the industry at large on how to ensure that as IoT fills out the range of applications, the security part of it continues to be addressed sufficiently. So yes, any time you have a node that is connected, its security is a key part of what we need to think about in the solution we deliver.
Operator: And with no additional questions in the queue, I'd like to then turn the floor back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Stephen Sanghi: Okay. We want to thank everyone for attending our conference call. After a little break, at 5:45 Eastern Time, we'll be starting our second conference call, which is regarding the acquisition of Micrel, and we'll hear some of you again on that call. So thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you, all, again for your participation.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-01-29 17:00:00) =====
Executives: James Eric Bjornholt - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Vice President of Finance Ganesh Moorthy - Chief Operating Officer Stephen Sanghi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President
Analysts: Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division Wills Miller
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
James Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the December quarter were $535.8 million and were down 1.9% sequentially from non-GAAP net sales of $546.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter. The December quarter revenue exceeded the high end of our updated guidance for the quarter. Revenue by product line was $345.5 million for microcontrollers, $125.5 million for analog, $33.2 million for memory, $22.9 million for licensing and $8.7 million of other. Revenue by geography was $104.9 million in the Americas, $105.9 million in Europe and $325 million in Asia. I'll remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.2% in the December quarter, at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.6% of sales, well below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 31.6% of sales, and net income was $143.3 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.64 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our updated guidance. GAAP net sales in the December quarter were $528.7 million and were $7.1 million lower than non-GAAP net sales, as we changed the contractual relationships with the ISSC distribution network to a sell-through revenue recognition model. On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were $57.1 million in the December -- 51 -- 57.1% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.3 million of share-based compensation, $4.2 million of charges associated with the sell-through of written-up inventory from our acquisitions of Supertex and ISSC and $3.2 million of gross profit on the revenue recognition change previously mentioned. Total operating expenses were $204 million or 38.6% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $47.6 million, share-based compensation of $12.5 million, $0.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $1 million. GAAP net income was $86.1 million or $0.39 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $3.9 million, including a benefit from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10.3% and the GAAP tax rate was 1.6%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $3.9 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5% to 11%. To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the December quarter, acquisition-related items were $0.223, share-based compensation was about $0.05, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.018, the difference in GAAP and non-GAAP noncontrolling interest in ISSC was a favorable $0.008, and a noncash interest expense was about $0.007. The dividend declared today of $0.357 per share will be paid on March 9, 2015, to shareholders of record on February 23, 2015. The cash payments associated with this dividend will be approximately $72 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 50th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend, and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 44th occasion we have increased the dividend payment, and our cumulative dividends paid amount to over $2.4 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. And during the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, including the stock buyback that we had when we issued our convertible debt back in fiscal year 2008. Our cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is over $3.8 billion. Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 31, 2014, was $276.1 million or 111 days compared to 109 days at the end of the September quarter, excluding any purchase accounting adjustments. 100% of the written-up inventory from our acquisitions is now out of our inventory balance. Inventory at our distributors increased by 2 days in the December quarter and are at 36 days. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We intend to grow the days of inventory on our balance sheet in the March quarter as we continue to focus on improving lead times for our customers. The cash generation in the December quarter, excluding the purchase of additional shares of ISSC, our dividend payment, changes in marketable equity securities and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was $145.7 million. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.23 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $981.3 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the March quarter. Capital spending was approximately $36.6 million for the December quarter. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2015 to be about $160 million as we are adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $24.7 million. As discussed earlier, the contractual terms of our relationships with the ISSC distributors changed during the December quarter, resulting in about $7 million of lower GAAP versus non-GAAP revenue. There is another $4 million of product in the ISSC distribution channel related to products sold to these distributors by ISSC under their prior contracts. This will result in GAAP revenue being about $4 million less than non-GAAP revenue in the March quarter. At the end of the March quarter, this transition to a sell-through model will be completed for ISSC, and there will be no further differences between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue recognition related to this change. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter and provide an update on the integration activities related to the ISSC acquisition. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was up 10.3% in the December quarter from a year-ago quarter. For calendar year 2014, our microcontroller business was up 13.8% and set an all-time record. Also for calendar year 2014, each of our 3 microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, set revenue records. Microcontrollers represented 64.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. You may recall that we told you last quarter that our 16- and 32-bit combined microcontroller business was in the range of $400 million to $500 million annualized. Since then, we have received substantial feedback through prospective employees and industry sources that our competitors were very surprised to learn about the size of our 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller business. And we're actively seeking more information as to where we were winning. It appears our competitors had assumed that our business was still embryonic and were surprised by the magnitude of the revenue range we provided. We believe that our stealth mode in keeping the actual size of business confidential has helped us in gaining substantial momentum in these product lines. With our competitors now apparently scurrying around trying to triangulate on which markets and applications we're achieving our success, we have decided that we are not going to help their effort. Going forward, we will no longer be breaking out the growth rate of the individual microcontroller segments. As you have seen from our disclosures, the size of each of our 8-, 16- and 32-bit businesses is quite substantial. We did break out the growth rates for several quarters when it was important to communicate a sense for the rate of growth of the 16-bit and 32-bit businesses while they were smaller businesses. Henceforth, consistent with the practice of most of our competitors, we will only be reporting overall microcontroller revenue and growth rate. So for one last time for your records, our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 27.7% in calendar year 2014, and our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 41.3% in calendar year 2014. Based on the growth we've experienced in calendar year 2014 in all 3 microcontroller segments, we believe we're continuing to gain significant microcontroller market share, and we expect the calendar year 2014 market share rankings will bear that out when they are published later this year. Now let's move to our analog products. Our analog business was up 15.3% from the year-ago quarter. In calendar year 2014, our analog business was up 15.7% and also set an all-time record. This business continues to have strong design win momentum in a broad range of applications and represented 23.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter, the highest percentage that it has ever been. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. Moving to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products. This business was up 2% over a year-ago quarter. In calendar year 2014, our memory business was down 1.5%. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. Finally, ISSC was integrated into our business systems as planned on November 1. At the end of December, we owned 91.1% of the ISSC shares, and on December 25, we delisted ISSC from the Taiwan Stock Exchange. We expect to acquire the remaining shares of ISSC in the first half of 2015 and complete the merger process during that time. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Stephen Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2015 and calendar year 2014. Then, I will comment on the progress of some of our acquisitions and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. We are very pleased with our execution in the December quarter. Our original revenue guidance for December quarter at the midpoint was down 4.5% sequentially. In early December, we revised that guidance upwards to be down 3.5% sequentially at the midpoint. Our actual results were down 1.9% sequentially, which was better than seasonal. Looking at the calendar year 2014, it was our first year to cross the $2 billion revenue mark. Calendar year '14 revenue came in at $2.107 billion, up 12.8% from calendar year '13. All of our strategic product lines of microcontrollers and analog posted strong performance in calendar year 2014. The December quarter was also our 97th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 97 consecutive profitable quarters. Now in the last conference call, we told you that we will be shutting down production in Supertex's San Jose fab as well as test facility in Hong Kong. There is excellent progress on both fronts. The last wafer starts in San Jose fab have already been made and the fab will close in the March/April time frame. The transfer of Hong Kong test to our high-volume Thailand facility is also on schedule for this quarter. As we said before, we believe that closure of the San Jose fab and the Hong Kong test facility will add about $0.05 to $0.07 of accretion on an annual basis after the older last-time buy inventory has been shipped out. Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. As we said in the last conference call, we completed the small correction in the September quarter, and then the December quarter turned out to be better than seasonal. March quarter is historically a very strong quarter in Europe and a weak quarter in Asia due to Lunar New Year holidays. The quarter is usually up low single-digit percentage sequentially. We expect this March quarter to be seasonally normal and expect the revenue to be up 1% to 3% sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.2% and 58.4% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 26.2% and 26.6% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 31.6% and 32.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.65 and $0.67 per share. Now I also promised to you that we will review our business units, geographical data, direct customers and distributors with a fine-tooth comb to make sure that our miss in September quarter was not driven by anything that has changed competitively that we may have missed. I'm happy to report that we have completed a total review and our miss in September quarter was nothing more than a quick correction and softening that we saw led by China. Beyond that, there was no other corrective action on our part. As you have now seen 2 quarters of data from the industry, you can see that our cumulative performance of 2 quarters, September and December, is in the top half of our MCU and analog peer group, and our 2% sequential growth guidance at the midpoint for the March quarter should further alleviate any of your concerns. Overall, our 2014 performance demonstrates Microchip has continued to gain market share in microcontrollers and analog. In closing, as I take stock of our business, I have never been more confident of our market position and our future prospects with the investments we have made and are continuing to make for the long-term success of Microchip. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Can you give any update on the ISSC and Supertex deals from a revenue perspective in terms of how that business is progressing? And I know things like cross-selling takes some time, but just how you see that materialize as we go forward.
James Eric Bjornholt: So we're not breaking out the revenue specifically for those 2 acquisitions any longer, but we're well on our way into integrating those product lines into our sales force and into our distribution network and are getting very good initial feedback on both. And so we're quite excited about the future opportunity, and the original plan associated with the acquisitions are intact.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. As a follow-up, Steve, there continues to be a lot of buzz around IoT. Can you give any context in terms of what you're seeing from a design perspective or customer engagements or any context around numbers as you look to kind of size up the opportunities for IoT?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, there is no standard definition of what you include in IoT or not. Different companies have different definitions. Some include the entire microcontroller, analog, sensor and the entire chain of products that go with it, along with the Wi-Fi solution, and some not. So I will say in general, we are excited about the opportunity presented by the IoT market. We have all the pieces needed, the intelligence in microcontroller, analog, smart memory, sensors, all of the connectivity protocols, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RF, ZigBee and everything else. And we think we have increasing presence in this fast-growing market. The broadest adoption of smartphones and tablets is accelerating the demand for more things to be connected, and Microchip is incredibly well placed by having all the components needed, like I mentioned, microcontroller, analog, memory, sensors as well as all the RF, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other building blocks. We have ready-mix suite of phoneware solutions to go with various connectivities. And we have a set of partners who can provide the cloud solutions and storage needed for people to be able to ping the data off the cloud. So I think we have really all the stuff needed. We have very substantial revenue in the IoT market. Depending on how you describe it, it could be many hundreds of millions of dollars, and there's a significant growth in the segment. Beyond that, I wish somebody were to define exactly what IoT is.
Operator: We'll go next to William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Steve, in the past, I think a big part of the company's growth strategy has been around acquiring companies, mostly in the analog space, to then cross-sell with the microcontrollers, and it's worked quite well historically. In calendar '14 though, I believe, on an organic basis, your analog and interface product grouping actually undergrew micro's, again, organically. And I'm wondering if you think that's -- first, if you could confirm I'm correct and then maybe comment as to why that might have happened and whether you think that will reverse in the next calendar year and perhaps you'll see greater attach for analog?
Stephen Sanghi: So I don't have the data broken out. We usually break out the data for a quarter or so, and after that, it's very, very difficult because the businesses get intertwined. When we buy a company, part of the thing is then, on a combined basis, to make intelligent selection about where Microchip's effort should go, which piece of the business is better positioned to go forward, an example could be when you acquire a company, you have some that kind of effort going on inside. And then you acquire a company which has a similar effort which is farther along. And after you acquire it, let's say you merge it together and you pursue the platform that you acquired, which would lower the revenue that you would have otherwise gained if you hadn't acquired them because you have similar products. So after about a quarter or so, which is really is important for The Street to know what's the core growth and what's the acquired growth, if you continue to carry it in any fashion a year out -- 9 months out, a year out, then you're really doing disservice because our job is to really to make the best assessments of where we put the effort, where the sales force sells it, where the field application engineer spends time, what is the best solution to present to our customer. And if you happen to present the acquired company's solution, more in favor of -- and not presenting our solution, if that's a negative indicator for you by looking at the core versus acquired growth, then we're not doing our job right, and I don't think that's what we're doing.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Maybe I'll try a different topic for a follow-up. Can you talk a bit about your capital spending plans? I think you mentioned them briefly, but I missed them in the prepared remarks. But maybe if you could attribute to which product category they relate, and how we should expect your capital planning to go forward through the year.
Stephen Sanghi: So as far as our capital plan is concerned, our capacity is very common. Our microcontrollers are loaded with analog functionality, a lot of the power management, analog conversion, a lot of interface functionality. Those are really on our microcontrollers also. And customer makes a choice whether he wants to buy a very high-end integrated microcontroller product or he wants to buy a lower-end microcontroller product and adds a standalone analog. So as a result, the processes we develop are internal factories as well as when we buy the product to foundries, those are common technologies and common capital. And it's very similar in the back end. Many of the testers and handlers are predominantly common. There is some customization. But -- so the capital doesn't really make a difference. Capital is very common.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: We can start at just asking a question with regard to industry conditions, and it's clear that it sounds like we've had a bit of an improvement here. Is there anything exceptional that you're seeing in the underlying business that deviates from normal seasonality in any particular geographic channels or industry segments at this point?
Stephen Sanghi: We are not -- essentially we are commenting only on our business, not the industry conditions. As we see our business, our guidance is built on performance in each channel, U.S., Europe and Asia, and direct distribution to be seasonally normal.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And just moving on with what's happened with some of the foreign exchange rates, particularly the yen. And I know that shouldn't have a particular effect on your business, but it does affect your Japanese competitors. Are you seeing any different competitive behavior as a result of the foreign exchange movements? And then maybe while you're on that topic, I know it's been your goal to take some share from the Japanese as well. Maybe you can comment on what you think your progress is there.
Stephen Sanghi: Well -- so as the Japanese yen depreciates, there's no question that somebody who produces entirely in Japan, their products become slightly cheaper, although a lot of the Japanese production has also moved to foundries and they have closed or sold a lot of their fabs and they're buying from similar foundries in Asia like we are buying. A lot of their assembly and test has been moved out after the earthquake. So the effect of yen is really much more muted than it ever was. The impact of really the lower cost, if there is any, is really much, much slower and it takes a long time because, really, it's at a designing level. Whatever is designed in our proprietary products, customers really cannot change. So the question really will be on new designs, can somebody from Japan be more competitive? And I think that's really -- there is a lot of hurdle people have. There's IP. There is installed base. There is development tools. There is legacy of products, software the people have designed in. So especially in our business, that impact is really fairly small and takes a very long time. It would be much more drastic in a memory business where you can really substitute one product for the other product to model. But in a microcontroller, analog designing business, I think it's a very negligible impact. But there is a second impact, which is really positive when you measure the market share. The market share dollar, as reported by Gartner or SIA or anybody else, is in dollars. And the majority of the sales of the Japanese companies is in Japan. They produce there, they sell there, they sell in yen. So when you take the yen sale and you convert them to dollars, it's going to be much smaller. That impact is immediate. So when you calculate market share, market share in dollar terms on a percentage basis is going to grow right away. And the other impact you're talking about is very long term, very slow and may or may not happen and we have a lot of time to come to that.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Danley [ph] with Citigroup.
Unknown Analyst: Stephen, in the press release, you talked about your guidance and you said with the current economic backdrop. So can you just go into your thoughts on the current economic backdrop, maybe talk about if you're seeing any differences by geos out there or what the distributors that you guys deal with are telling you about their business?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, I think it's basically -- that thing is superseded by saying everything is seasonally normal. If you take geography by geography, everybody is aware of what's happening in Europe in the currency, in the economy and all that. So that backdrop is taken into account. When you look at -- in Asia, that backdrop is taken into account. The China GDP has slowed down from what it was before. What they have done is similar in package [ph]. So whenever we know as of today, it is -- that's the background and that's taken into account. And looking at all that, I think business still looks seasonal.
Unknown Analyst: Great. And for my follow-up, in terms of the upside to guidance on the gross margins and the OpEx, was that all driven by better-than-expected execution on the acquisitions? Or was there some upside to the core business?
James Eric Bjornholt: So I'd say on, gross margin, it was modest, right? We had a relatively tight range and -- so we were 0.1% above the midpoint of our guidance. So that's just kind of noise level. OpEx, there was quite a bit of improvement there. Chris asked -- the other Chris asked some questions on FX, and the FX did have a positive impact on OpEx in the December quarter, but some of that was offset with a foreign exchange loss as we do some hedging against that. So I would say from an OpEx and gross margin standpoint, things performed pretty much as expected. The company did a good job of controlling costs and FX helped us a little bit on the OpEx line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from JoAnne Feeney with ABR Investment Strategy.
JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC: I just wanted to get a little clarification on the guidance, given the difference between the non-GAAP and the GAAP numbers and that difference moving in the opposite direction this quarter. Is the 1% to 3% based off of GAAP, non-GAAP? And does it refer to the GAAP or non-GAAP number this quarter?
James Eric Bjornholt: So if we presented that wrong, the non-GAAP and GAAP difference are going in the same direction. In the December quarter, there was a $7 million difference and GAAP revenue was lower than non-GAAP. Same thing in the current quarter. We're expecting that GAAP revenue to be about $4 million lower. Obviously, if you're looking at percentage increase changes, GAAP to GAAP, non-GAAP to non-GAAP, there's a difference. And we're giving our guidance of 1% to 3% growth, midpoint of 2%. That's based off the non-GAAP numbers. So hopefully, that's clear.
JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC: Great. And then as a follow-up, wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the margin outlook. In particular, are you planning to increase factory loadings anytime soon? Are you using more foundries than you were, say, last quarter? And then are there any mix shifts going on in your foreseeable future that would impact the margin outlook and your move towards the midterm model?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, if you look at over the last couple of quarters, I think our overall internal inventory got too low. I believe the bottom of it was about 103 days, wasn't it?
James Eric Bjornholt: About 105.
Stephen Sanghi: 105 days. And we let it get too low. Somewhere, some of the upsides we achieved in earlier quarters. But when the inventory gets too low, then we start to have longer lead time and delivery issues and all that. So we have made conscious efforts, both inside and outside, at the foundries as well as internally growing capacity to bring that inventory more in line. And you've seen the inventory now ending last quarter was 1...
James Eric Bjornholt: 111.
Stephen Sanghi: 111. So we've made some progress. We think it's still not where we want it to be. We want it to be between 115 and 120 days, so slowly, slowly. And as you are growing revenue, then you also acquire more product, and in calculating inventory, dividing by a larger number to calculate the days. So it will take a little bit of time, but we'll continue to work towards trying to get the inventory north of 115 days.
James Eric Bjornholt: Right. I guess that answered the other pieces of your question. That percentage of foundry of our business continues to be 38% to 40%. There's no significant change there, just very modest changes. Each quarter can go up or down, and we aren't anticipating any significant mix shifts of the business.
Stephen Sanghi: In our internal fabs, both of our fabs and both of our assembly and test facilities, they're all working at record loading. So there's really high amount of activity. And some of the gross margin we're seeing is really negatively impacted by 2 acquisitions last year. It's no longer impacted by the acquisition we did 2 years ago like SMSC. We totally lost time there, gross margin and operating margins in the range of Microchip. But the later acquisitions, Supertex and ISSC, their gross and operating margins are still well below Microchip. They're improving, but they're not quite there yet and it takes longer time. But if it was just our own performance, it's really better than the gross margin you're seeing.
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. My first question is in the automotive area. Do you plan on also participating in Ethernet or stay with the MOST approach? Or how do you see this particular competitive scenario playing out?
Ganesh Moorthy: So we do ship both Ethernet and MOST into automotive applications today. They're going to different types of applications. Networking in the car is a focus for Microchip. We dominate the space that is around infotainment networking today. With the most network, we have many new products planned. And whatever the market requirements are that are appropriate and cost effective and competitive, we will have those solutions.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And in the area of connectivity, especially connectivity that you have acquired, do you have the ability to integrate this with your microcontrollers? Perhaps, you could add some color around your strategy in this area.
Ganesh Moorthy: Rather than speak to the strategy, let me speak to what the capability is. Clearly, the technologies that are involved to build the networking products have similarities with the technologies that we build our microcontroller and analog products on. And yes, you will over time see appropriate levels of integration where some of the capability will show up on our microcontrollers.
Stephen Sanghi: Yes, I want to clarify one thing, though, which again touches on the strategy. If your strategy is to go get one large $50 million account, whether it's in networking or smartphones or whatever, then that integration is very important. Then you take a microcontroller, take the RF, take everything and you're delivering SoC to that customer. If your strategy is to try to sell that 2,000 accounts, long-tail customers like Microchip does that have substantially higher margin and a better business model longer term, then integration is not always the best answer because everybody wants a different microcontroller and density and speed and bit size and different performance levels and different things in it. So then you have a problem in choosing a microcontroller. And if you choose a very large, higher-superset microcontroller, then you make it expensive for everybody else. So the best answer to serve 1,000 customers is not always integrated, but the best answer to serve one large customer is always an integrated SoC. So those have strategy implications.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
Wills Miller: This is Wills Miller calling in for John Pitzer. First, can you help me think about seasonality throughout 2015? More specifically, The Street is modeling up roughly 4% sequentially in June quarter versus seasonal of roughly 7% to 8%. I'm curious because the June quarter was seasonally strong for SMSC. Is this something -- is there something The Street may be missing?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, we didn't prepare this call to be able to answer anything regarding June in terms of guidance.
James Eric Bjornholt: Right. I think the only thing I would say to that is you need to be careful when you look at our historical numbers in terms of when we did acquisitions and the impact of those on any particular quarter when looking at trying to determine what seasonality is. But Steve's right, we haven't given guidance beyond the March quarter.
Wills Miller: Okay, great. And then can you just talk a bit about your expectations by end market for 2015, what do you expect to be the main drivers?
Stephen Sanghi: So we don't really usually have end-market commentary. We serve 90,000-plus customers around the world. A large number of them buy product from distribution and same customers in different divisions, their end market is either industrial or consumer or it can be PC and some have automotive divisions. And so therefore, we don't break our business down by end markets like that.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to our speakers for any final remarks.
Stephen Sanghi: Okay. Thank you for attending the call today, and we will talk to you next quarter. Bye-bye.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's program. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a great day.

Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Second Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt:  Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC, that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.  In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, provide some additional information on our acquisition integration activities, and discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relation page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.  Net sales in the September quarter were a record $546.2 million, including $16.9 million of net sales from ISSC, and were up 2.8% sequentially from non-GAAP net sales of $531.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Revenue by product line was a record $361.8 million for microcontrollers, $122.6 million for analog, $32.5 million for memory, $22.6 million for licensing and $6.8 million of other. Revenue from ISSC is classified within microcontrollers.  Revenue by geography was a record $108.6 million in the Americas, $110.8 million in Europe, and $326.8 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of the contract manufacturing takes place.  On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 59.1% in the September quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.6% of sales. Non-GAAP operating income was 32.5% of sales. Net income was $150.2 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.67 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 56.3% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.6 million of share-based compensation, and $12.7 million of charges associated with the sell-through of written-up inventory from our acquisitions of Supertex and ISSC.  Total operating expenses were $206.1 million, or 37.7% of sales, and include acquisition intangible amortization of $45.4 million, share-based compensation of $12.6 million, $1.8 million of acquisition-related expenses, and special charges of $0.8 million. The GAAP net income was $93.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes non-recurring favorable tax events of $10.5 million, which were primarily associated with the release of certain valuation allowances, the passing of the statute of limitations on certain tax reserves, and the favorable closing of a tax audit.  In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10.9%, and the GAAP tax rate was a benefit of 1.5%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $10.5 million of non-recurring tax events that I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various non-recurring items. Excluding any non-recurring events, we expect our longer-term, forward-looking, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5% to 11%.  To summarize the after-tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the September quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.241, share-based compensation was about $0.06, non-recurring favorable tax events were about $0.047. The difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP non-controlling interest in ISSC was a favorable $0.009, and the non-cash interest expense was about $0.007.  The dividend declared today of $0.3565 per share will be paid on December 5, 2014, to shareholders of record on November 21, 2014. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $71.7 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 49th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. In fact, this quarter's increase marks the 43rd occasion we have increased the dividend payment. And the accumulative dividends paid amount to almost $2.4 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.  During the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, including the stock that we bought back when we issued our convertible in fiscal year 2008. Our total return to shareholders through dividend and stock buy-back over the past 49 quarters is approximately $3.8 billion.  Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory at September 30, 2014, was $275.7 million, or 105 days, compared to 109 days at the end of the June quarter. The inventory balance at September 30, 2014, includes $4.5 million of inventory write-up costs associated with our acquisitions as required for GAAP purchase accounting. Including the inventory write up, excluding the inventory write-up, Microchip had 109 days of inventory on its balance sheet as of the end of the quarter.  We have taken steps to adjust our capacity in our wafer fabs and our assembly and test facilities given the current business environment. Inventory at our distributors increased by three days in the September quarter and are at 34 days. Most of the distribution inventory build in the quarter was at our distributors in Asia. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis.  The increase in Microchip's net cash and investment balance in the September quarter, excluding our acquisition of ISSC and our dividend payment, was $156.2 million. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $2.124 billion. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit decreased to $965.6 million.  Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $110 million to $140 million in the December quarter. Capital spending was approximately $38.7 million for the September quarter. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the December quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2015 to be about $150 million, as we are adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies, and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced.  Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $24.3 million. Historically, the ISSC business has recognized revenue in the distribution channel on a sell-in basis. Microchip will be changing the contractual relationships with ISSC's distributors effective November 1, to move to a sell-through revenue-recognition model.  During this transition, Microchip's reported GAAP revenue will not include the sell-through of any inventory that was in the ISSC distribution channel as of the end of October. Based on about 1.5 months of inventory in the ISSC distribution channel, we expect GAAP revenue will be about $7 million lower in the December quarter than it would have been if ISSC had historically recognized revenue on a sell-through basis.  To provide investors with an appropriate understanding of the true end-market demand for the ISSC products, Microchip will report its non-GAAP revenue in the December quarter for ISSC, based on if a full sell-through model had been in place for ISSC in the past. We expect non-GAAP revenue for ISSC to be about $17 million in the December quarter. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter, and provide an update on the integration activities related to the ISSC acquisition. Ganesh? 
Ganesh Moorthy:  Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Including ISSC revenue, which will be reported as part of our microcontroller revenue, our overall microcontroller business grew 5.2% sequentially in the September quarter, and was up 12.7% from the year-ago quarter, thus achieving a new record.  Excluding revenue from ISSC, our overall microcontroller revenue grew by 0.3% sequentially in the September quarter, and was up 7.4% versus the year ago quarter, and also achieved a new revenue record. We're being transparent with the revenue added from our ISSC acquisitions, so that analysts and investors can more meaningfully compare our microcontroller results to other companies.  Excluding any revenue from ISSC, our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 8.3% sequentially in the September quarter, also achieving a new record for revenue. 16-bit microcontroller revenue was up 23.3% versus the year-ago quarter. This business continues to be an important engine of ongoing growth for us, as we continue to find and serve new customers and new applications with our expanding portfolio. Excluding revenue from ISSC, our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 7.6% sequentially in the September quarter, also achieving a new record for revenue. 32-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 38.6% versus the year-ago quarter.  We are continuing to rapidly expand our new product portfolio, win new designs, and expand our presence in new fields of play, to enable further growth in revenue and market share. Our 32-bit microcontroller business, combined with our 16-bit microcontroller business, together are at the size and growth rate where they're making meaningful contribution to our ongoing growth.  We believe we are continuing to gain significant microcontroller market share and expect the 2014 market share rankings to bear that out when it is published next year. We have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share, as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Microcontroller’s revenue represented 66.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter.  Now moving to analog products. Our analog business was down 4.1% sequentially in the September quarter, and was up 13.2% from the year-ago quarter. This business continues to have strong design win momentum, and represented 22.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.  Now moving to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory, as well as our SuperFlash memory products. This business was down 2.6% sequentially. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business, and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter.  Finally, the ISSC integration is moving ahead at full speed, and will transition to our business systems on November 1. We expect to complete buying the majority of the approximately 16% of shares of ISSC that we don't yet own, and de-listing ISSC from the Taiwan stock exchange by the end of December 2014. Steve will provide much more color on the ISSC and Supertex acquisitions in his prepared remarks. So let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve? 
Steve Sanghi:  Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Then I will comment on the progress of some of our acquisitions, and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. I will also comment on the macro-cycle call we made three weeks ago.  We are disappointed with the level of business activity in the September quarter. September quarter is usually a very back-end-weighted quarter, because of traditional weak August, due to holidays in various parts of the world. The month of September is usually a very strong month for our revenue after the summer holiday period. This time, the September sales did not materialize to our expectations, leading us to pre-announce the quarter on October 9, 2014.  There were a few bright spots in the results, in the areas of microcontrollers and licensing division. As Ganesh mentioned, 16-bit MCUs were up 8.1% sequentially, and 32-bit MCUs were up 7.6% sequentially. Overall MCU revenue achieved another all-time record in the quarter. Licensing division revenue was up 10.5% sequentially, reflecting increased penetration of our SuperFlash technology at foundries and IDMs, alike.  During the quarter we worked on simultaneous integration of two different acquisitions. On April 1, 2014, we had closed the acquisition of Supertex. By July 1, 2014, we had integrated the financial and business systems of Supertex with Microchip's. During the quarter we successfully qualified many of the high-volume products of Supertex in Microchip's Tempe, Arizona, fab.  During the quarter, we also decided that we will close down Supertex San Jose Fab. It is a six-inch wafer fab located in a leased building in San Jose, California. Currently we are on schedule to make the last wafer start in San Jose fab by the end of November. We will close the fab sometime in February 2015. We have allotted for making some last-time buy wafers for the products that have not been qualified in the Tempe fab yet, and also to provide overlap for customers qualifying their products from Tempe fab.  During the quarter, we also decided to phase out production in Supertex the Hong Kong test facility. The cost of production there is significantly more expensive than Microchip's high-volume facility in Thailand. Production in the Hong Kong facility will be phased out by February 2015, also. We believe that closure of the Santa Jose fab and the Hong Kong test facility will add about $0.05 to $0.07 of accretion on an annual basis after the older last-time buy inventory has been shipped out. Supertex's business model is already improving significantly. Last quarter, Supertex's gross margin was 54.7%, and operating margin was approximately 24.7%. When the full impact of production in Microchip's facilities is baked in, we believe Supertex will be operating at Microchip's gross and operating profit models. I remind you that Supertex standalone non-GAAP operating margin, in the full calendar year 2013 before the acquisition was 17.2%. Supertex contributed $0.014 accretion last quarter, which will go to about $0.03 per quarter after the full effect of factory shut-downs has been baked in. We believe it will take about a year to see the full impact. Now about ISSC acquisition. ISSC added $16.9 million to our net sales in the September quarter, and contributed about $0.01 accretion to our non-GAAP EPS. The integration of ISSC is under way. We are on target to consolidate the financial and business systems of ISSC with Microchip's on November 1, 2014. The organization of ISSC is also being merged with the divisional, sales, finance, and other organizations of Microchip.  The September quarter was also our 96th consecutive profitable quarter. We have four more quarters to go in order to hit the century mark for consecutive profitable quarters. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 96 consecutive profitable quarters.  Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. December quarter is seasonally the weakest quarter for Microchip. Having seen most of the correction in the September quarter, we expect the December quarter revenue to be only slightly below typical seasonal levels. We expect our non-GAAP revenue to be down 2% to 7% sequentially in the December quarter. In adjusting our factories, we have selectively pushed out some capital equipment previously on order, but we are continuing to invest in our growth initiatives.  Continuing on the guidance, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58% and 58.2% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 27% and 27.5% of sales and we expect operating profit to be between 30.5% and 31.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.59 and $0.64 per share.  Now let's talk about the semiconductor cycle and our pre-announcement. In each semiconductor business cycle, this debate rages in the investment and analyst community. Does Microchip have an internal Microchip problem or do our results reflect a weakening macro? And each time we give the same explanation regarding how we see the effect of industry events earlier than others, and we have subsequently been vindicated when the entire industry softens a quarter or so later. But after all these times of telling us that we were right in the previous cycles, the controversy after we make the comments the same as we have seen in the prior cycles. This time it is no different, and it seems that it is really par for the course. I have seen an unprecedented amount of spin in explaining the weak guidance of other companies. One company even called it amplified seasonality, with customers wanting to make sure that they position inventory where they're going to be comfortable at. Now what is that, that sounds like a correction. According to Needham's report, 73% of the companies that have reported thus far have issued guidance lower than consensus, and that does not include companies that reported yesterday or today. This process at other companies in the past have taken two earning cycles to complete, so you have to wait for the January earnings season to see the whole story unfold, and see what happens at all the selling companies. The overarching question remains whether there is a slow-down of the industry ahead, led by China, or was it a company-specific Microchip problem. So let me digress for a minute. At Microchip, we are the students of Jim Collins' famous book, Good To Great. I adopted some of those principles in Microchip culture, which was also documented in my book, titled Driving Excellence. Jim Collins defined level-live leadership in his book. When things go well, a level-five leader looks out the window and thanks his people for having done a great job. I have always thanked my people for having done a great job in achieving 96 consecutive quarters of profitability. Jim Collins says that when things go wrong, a level-five leader looks in the mirror, and takes responsibility, and internalizes what he personally could have done better. Now, December quarter guidance from the industry has been a mixed bag so far. If it turns out that Microchip was wrong in making a cycle call, I would look in the mirror and personally take responsibility to correct whatever may be wrong in our business. However, you are already starting to see commentary from late reporting companies about bookings weakness; weakness in industrial and consumer markets; inventory management by distributors; weakness in Asia; and some even -- some companies even calling for broad weakness across most end markets; and weak macro conditions, combined with seasonality to cause near-double-digit revenue declines. That is, and I quote, amplified “seasonality”. In terms of taking responsibility, we are going through all of our business units, geographical data, direct customers, and distributors with a fine tooth comb. In case our call turns out to be wrong, we want to be prepared in understanding what went wrong and already taken steps taken to correct it. There was a belief on the street that Microchip's problem was caused by the customer letter that we issued on July 31. When you have a few large customers, it is easy to communicate with them regarding your lead times and business environment. With more than 80,000 customers at Microchip, it is very difficult to get the message across without writing such letters and posting them on the web. We were receiving complaints from customers that they needed to be informed that lead time on some products had stretched out. So Microchip wrote the letter to inform our broad base of customers. In fact, the letter had no effect on our revenue, and it stands to reason that a letter issued on July 31 communicating 12 weeks of lead time would have no impact on the September quarter revenue. If the letter is accused of causing any double ordering, then the September quarter sales should have gone up, not down. In reality, the September distribution sales did not materialize, and distribution inventory increased. If we had selling revenue recognition like some of our peers use, we too would have met our guidance for the September quarter. So the letter was not it. Continuing to diagnose the business within Microchip, our microcontroller business without counting ISSC was up about 0.3% sequentially to another record. It was also up 7.4% from same quarter last year. We did not add the revenue of ISSC acquisition completed last quarter, to make a fair comparison to other companies. The last quarter over a year ago quarter performance is better than many of our microcontroller competitors. So we are comfortable with how the businesses are performing inside. Now in every cycle, when we miss a quarter the old bear thesis comes out of the woodwork, like Microchip doesn't have ARM-based MCUs, they are mainly exposed to 8-bit, their 16-bit and 32-bit businesses are small, et cetera. Now we don't break out the numbers by bit density due to competitive reasons, but today we can give you a hint that our combined 16 and 32-bit microcontroller business is about $400 million to $500 million annually, not small by any stretch of the imagination. So this bear thesis has been proven wrong every time, and Microchip has continued to gain significant share in microcontrollers and analog. Looking at all of the late earnings reports that have come out, I can already see this bear thesis getting proven wrong again. The current point in the cycle, or whatever you wish to call it, has made a very good entry point in Microchip's stock, with substantial return as the recovery unfolds. We expect to complete this recovery with a sequential increase in revenue in the March quarter. I also want to point out that many of Microchip's analysts who have gone through this experience before, and have invested time to understand our business dynamic were very constructive after our warning, and recognized that we have called this correctly several times before. Our thanks are due for their taking time over the years to understand the dynamics of our business, and for their support. In closing, as I take stock of our business, I have never been more confident of our market position, and our future prospects with the investment we have made and are continuing to make for the long-term success of Microchip. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions.
Operator: Absolutely. (Operator Instructions) We'll take now take Chris Caso from Susquehanna Financial Group.
Chris Caso – Susquehanna Financial Group: Hi, thank you. Good afternoon. Steve, I wondered if you could maybe take us through the last month since the pre-announcement. Obviously at the time and it sounds like you still feel that way, that we're in an industry down-turn. But based on your guidance, it would seem to be a fairly mild down turn as compared to some of the others. I guess a few questions on that. Is that an accurate assessment of how you feel? Has anything changed in your view since you made the call earlier in the month and what gives you confidence in the visibility that you have?
Steve Sanghi:  Well, nothing has changed since we made that call. In fact, many other companies are singing the same song. We did not quantify in our pre-release. We didn't have all the data to be able to provide the guidance at that time, so it was a very limited release. We could have waited another 21 days to tell the numbers today. But – son in pre-release we simply made the statement that we see a correction coming. The street reaction and their interpretation of that correction was grossly overestimated.  And, we see a yes, we see a slight correction and one to two quarters worth. For us, last quarter was down, this quarter is nearly seasonal. Our last 10 year average of seasonality for December quarter is minus 4.38, to be exact. To do that math, you've got to take some of the acquisitions out. If you're doing an acquisition in August and you know, it skews the numbers, so you have to do some math to do that. Minus 4.38, and our guidance is pretty much seasonal for this quarter, and we expect us to sequentially grow in the March quarter. 
Operator:  We'll now take our next question from JoAnne Feeney with ABR Investment Strategy.
JoAnne Feeney – ABR Investment Strategy: Yes, thanks for taking my question. So I was wondering, Steve, if you could or Eric, if you could address the question that's come up as to whether the shift in the dollar to yen exchange rate, which has now persisted for a few quarters might have been altering your competitive position against Renesas and may have driven some consumers away?
Steve Sanghi: Well, Joanne, nobody asked us the question when yen went the other way whether our competitive position was improving. The fact of the matter is microcontroller designs are done two years before, and microcontroller sockets are not competed on such a close price issue of yen versus a dollar. A large majority of Renesas business is in Japan, where we have a relatively small business. We see really relatively small competition with them in US and Europe. The ones we see are mainly in the automotive market, where designs are three, four-year designs. It really absolutely has zero impact.
Eric Bjornholt: JoAnne, to add to that, you can see the Renesas results. They are public, and there is nothing to write home about.
JoAnne Feeney – ABR Investment Strategy: Okay, that's helpful. As then a follow-up, I'm wondering, you know, you're always faced with a difficult question about what your end markets look like, and the geographical distribution not being terribly representative of the actual end consumers. But given that you've come to have to look at this cycle, I'm wondering if you've looked at perhaps another way to represent your end markets? And in particular, to what sorts of end markets in China are you most exposed, given all the acquisitions you've had, in which sorts of products? And if you can address that, and perhaps how much you're exposed to the housing market perhaps then you can let us know what you think about the new China stimulus measures that were announced just yesterday, and how that might affect the extent of your recovery here?
Steve Sanghi:  Well, obviously, any stimulus measures announced in China will have a positive effect on us, like it would in any other market. JoAnne, our business is the broadest business any company could have. I don't know really how everybody else counts the number of their customers, but our top 10 customers don't make even 10% of our business. You'll have to go deep tail, we've got 80,000 customers. We do business with everybody, you know, people making no matter what, because microcontroller and analog, they are the most ubiquitous devices. You've got chips in light pens and cables and just everything.  So we have a very, very broad business and with such a broad business, you're very much tied into the sentiment of every little company building stuff and lots and lots of small companies who build their stuff in their own garage shop and don't use the large subcontractors and don't have the sophisticated supply chains and multiple subcontractors building products for them. In that kind of environment information is very hard to get and can easily take a quarter. Because every subcontractor thinks well they gained market share. They're doing 60% of the total. If there are three subcontractors, everybody thinks they're doing 40% of the total, and that number adds up to 120%, just like there's inventory in the channel.  But with our customers with a long tail, it's the chief engineer who is the President and he's directing the buy. We see the impact of any market moves economy related directly on our revenue on a sell-through basis from distribution and also from our direct customers. And with that kind of business, it's very, very difficult to give you end market breakdown, because we do business with everybody. 
JoAnne Feeney – ABR Investment Strategy:  Okay. We'll do our best with that. Thanks. 
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Operator:  We'll now take our next question from William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust: Great. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. Not exactly to follow up on that prior one, but Steve you did highlight that the weakness came from the channel in China. Meanwhile we actually saw pretty robust results from the likes of both Arrow and Avnet, which I think are, represent at least part of your channel. They had good results. So should we think about this maybe as kind of smaller tier two type suppliers or rather distributors? And maybe you can also talk about if there's any identification of the weakness from not only an end market perspective, but large versus smaller customers, OEMs versus contract manufacturers, regionally in China, it's just a bit perplexing? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: 
 : 
Eric Bjornholt:  Yes, Americas was up about 5% and Europe was up 1%. 
Steve Sanghi:  Yes. So we were up in both geographies, so US and Europe were very good. So our problem was in China. Our business in Asia is a much larger percentage than Arrow's and Avnet's business is, so that will really explain one.  Secondly, every single question you can ask in this line what we saw versus the others saw, we make this statement and we make this explanation in every cycle, because the way our business is, which I just explained in answering Joanne's question, we have a very long tail of lots of these small customers, and revenue recognition based on sell-through, that we do see effects of industry turns early, about a quarter or so early. It's happened every time. We go through the same criticism and the same line of questions every time. I don't even know why we do it. And a quarter letter when things settle, then everybody has seen it and then for now then people are telling me for the last 10 years, we have called every one of them right. This is going to be the same.
William Stein - SunTrust:  Steve, I appreciate that. If I can ask one follow-up, perhaps you could talk a little bit about capacity planning. I know that last quarter at this time you were talking about some spot shortages, as I recall and having to add capacity kind of as quickly as you could in order to meet customer demand. And I'm wondering if perhaps there is a different approach where you may get, you may want to add the capacity in advance of the rush sort of demand and kind of talk maybe a bit about your capacity planning generally? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi:  Well, you know, we've been in business 24 years. I have been on this job and we've gone through many cycles and our capacity planning has been excellent. This was a one time. We are on a select group of new products and technologies. Our business, as I mentioned, last quarter was growing nearly 15% to 20% sequentially per quarter, quarter-after-quarter for many quarters, almost a couple of years. And we went into a plan for the fiscal year to put a capacity for 50% growth on those products, which internally was questioned are we crazy, and so on and so forth and if I told you, you would really ask similar questions.  We grew more than that. We grew 70% to 75%. So it was because of tremendous success in a certain line of products. It wasn't across the board. It was certain select group of products. The weakness we saw in the September quarter has largely corrected that problem minor amount that remains really gets corrected this quarter. So it was a really short term kind of problem. We have fixed it. It's not a deep rooted capacity-planning issue. We're really good at it. 
William Stein - SunTrust:  That's helpful, Thank you. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) We'll now take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. 
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley:  Great. Thank you. Can you follow up on the comments that you do see it as kind of a slight correction calendar Q3 and Q4? What's the feedback like from customers in the channel as you look into March quarter, which typically is up and you're calling that to be up at this early stage?
Steve Sanghi : Do you want to take that?
Eric Bjornholt:  Yes, we don't have all the visibility into March that perhaps your question implies. We look at what does it seasonally look like. We look at how is the backlog for the March quarter starting to build. We know what has flushed through the system in September and in our guidance for December. And if you put all that together, the best of our intelligence and our own analysis, what we're hearing from our customers, what we're hearing from our field, gives us the confidence to talk about the March quarter being up.
Steve Sanghi: 
 : I think guidance for September is already kind of seasonal, so it's highly unlikely. There's really almost no reason for it that the March quarter then gets away from seasonality again in a negative direction. It's just not likely there will be a double dip. 
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley:  Got it. And then as my follow-up Steve, you made the comment you view the stock after the pull-back here as attractive. The company in the past has been opportunistic in terms of buy-back. So how do you view that in terms of buying back your own stock, versus pursuing potential M&A opportunities? 
Steve Sanghi:  We don't really have any US cash to buy back stock. We cannot buy stock with our foreign money without writing a check to Washington, and we're not going to do that. So we'll maintain the foreign cash for acquisitions or to bring it in when some tax favored deal can be put together like it was several years ago for patriation. So meanwhile, we continue to be active, looking for various M&A opportunities rather than buying back stock. 
Eric Bjornholt:  And we have the debt capacity to be able to go out and do those things. 
Steve Sanghi:  We do have a $1 billion plus remaining on our line of credit, but we're not going to use it for buying stock. It's not that far away from where it was, you know, $3 or $4, you know, that's not it. 
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley:  Okay. Got it. Thank you. 
Operator: 
 : 
Harsh Kumar - Stephens:  Hi, Steve. If I can ask you, what in your best opinion was the source of the weakness that you are seeing? Is it you think in your best opinion inventory driven, or was it just a spot pause in demand? And we're hearing from you things have already picked up. Just if you can give us some color we would appreciate it. 
Steve Sanghi:  Well, you know, I am sure and I hope you guys watch the news that I watch and the headlines that I watch. China industrial production was the lowest in 5 years. The growth of that China housing market has been well written. The negative effect on China GDP that has been seen from stimulus that was taken away for a while ago. And then you know the macro conditions were slow. And we had anticipated a certain amount of demand. And sometimes people have trouble making a connection between inventory and lower demand. It's really one and the same.  When the demand is low it creates inventory, because you were building it to a higher demand and then you have to correct for it and it's really one and the same. But macro conditions in China were weak. The whole LP build has been lower. You have seen that in the results of companies who were exposed to that. You have seen broad based guys like announced in the last week. You've seen from plenty of them. Other than really one smartphone manufacturer, unless you're really largely exposed to it, that has been the only strength driven by shipping RF and all those things into those phones. The other big cell phone guy has been weak, also. So there's really only been one place to hide, which is if you're exposed highly to the guy in Cupertino. 
Harsh Kumar - Stephens:  That's, fair, Steve. Steve, as we look out, Steve and Eric, as we look out to December and we try to model for that $20 million odd sort of decline that your guidance suggests, should we think of spreading that roughly equally amongst the different businesses by percentage rating, of course? 
Steve Sanghi:  Yes. We've got 13, 14 different divisions inside of Microchip that we put together in about three or four buckets report to you. We can't really break it out on a guidance. We got the numbers, but we believe that it will be reasonably spread equally. 
Harsh Kumar - Stephens:  Thanks, guys. Appreciate it, as always. 
Steve Sanghi:  Thank you.
Operator: 
 :
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Yes, guys. Steve, thanks for letting me ask the question. Steve, I was wondering if you could help quantify a little bit how much you're taking down utilization, how much were you able to get ahead of this within the September quarter versus December. Is there sort of an inventory target we should think about for the company exiting December? And as my follow-up, is the gross-margin decline in December all utilization driven and will there be a residual effect in the March quarter for some of the actions you're taking in December on utilization?
Steve Sanghi:  So, you want to answer that? 
Eric Bjornholt:  Sure. I can answer the utilization piece. So, yes, we've taken our factories down. There's some impact in the December quarter from that. We would not project at this point that gross margins would go lower in the March quarter. So with the decline in revenue and we are building inventory in the December quarter, we would expect that just based on our accounting practices we would have higher inventory obsolescence charges, probably not true obsolescence, but obsolescence’s charges from an accounting standpoint.  With our expectation that revenue will increase in the March quarter, we would not expect that to repeat. So, we have taken our utilization down in both fabs and assembly and test facilities, but we aren't breaking out a specific percentage for the street. 
Steve Sanghi: 
 : We are very transparent, so we take it right away in the current quarter, so that's what you see. So if the utilization doesn't go any lower next quarter, which there's no reason it should, you shouldn't see any further lower gross margin. 
Eric Bjornholt:  Adding to your point on inventory, so if you take out all the goofy acquisition accounting, and we ended the September quarter with about 109 days of inventory. And we've got a fairly broad range for the current quarter that's in our release for what inventory could do, just based on our revenue range. But based on the mid-point of our guidance, we think that increase in inventory might be seven or eight days. That would take it to let's say 116 at the mid point. That's kind of on target with what our external guidance has been for target for the longer term. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse:  Eric, just as clarification, that's inventory on your balance sheet? What do you expect through distribution in the December quarter? 
Eric Bjornholt:  That's a hard one to forecast. We were at pretty low levels heading into the September quarter. It went up by 3 days. If you look at where it's been in the last 5 or 6 years, it's ranged between 27 and 47 days. So sitting at 34 days doesn't really concern us. But you know, there will be some movement, but it's very hard to forecast. 
Steve Sanghi:  So, you know, that's another area where I think street's interpretation of our inventory build was a massive inventory in the channel, hundreds of millions of dollars or something. Inventory went up from 31 to 34 days, I mean, that's all. And you know, many companies that say they've got distribution inventory ranges, 8 to 10 weeks or something like that, it's a slight shift, but it all happened to be in China. That three days increase, it all happened in China. So the number of days increase in China is little more than that, and has to be corrected. But it's really not a massive increase in inventory. We don't know what distribution would do, whatever they buy from us, it's not our revenue until they sell it out.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Perfect, guys. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: You're welcome.
Operator:  We'll now take our next question from Gilbert Alexander with Darfield Associates.
Gilbert Alexander - Darfield Associates:  Hi, good afternoon. You've answered basically my questions. I would ask one thing. This softness is it basically at the contract manufacturer's level?
Steve Sanghi:  The softness is not at a contract manufacturer’s level. The softness is in a customer demand level. If somebody in the June economy wanted to build 100,000 widgets, in September and December economy he wants to build 95,000 widgets. And you know, when the demand is down 4%, 5% then they are drawing that much less from distribution. If you were building it to your level, then distribution had that excess inventory they've got to bleed out. 
Gilbert Alexander - Darfield Associates:  All right. Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi: You are welcome, sir.
Operator:  We'll now go to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel: Thanks, for taking my question. Just on the attempted acquisition, or the proposal for Cambridge Silicon Radio. Can you talk a little more of what the strategy was there? Are you looking for more Bluetooth technology beyond what ISSC has?
Steve Sanghi:  Well, the basic Bluetooth technology we got from ISSC and it's very good, as good as any we could get. But ISSC revenue is $17 million a quarter and CSR had substantial scale and beyond scale, they also have the location technology. But we looked at CSR like any other acquisition would look at. At any point in time, we have three, four, five companies either we're talking to or getting with or doing the analysis. As we valued it, unfortunately our interest became public during the process, due to some leak somewhere. Otherwise you would have never known.  But after total diligence and was really a disciplined approach we have, and our track record of successful acquisitions, we were unable to reach a valuation for CSR that would support making the kind of offer they got from the other company, it was just that simple. 
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel:  I see. I wonder if I could just change subjects slightly and go to the utilization. With your foundries, have you cut back orders at foundries also? 
Steve Sanghi:  We have cut back orders in foundries also yes. 
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel:  Okay. Thank you. 
Steve Sanghi:  Yes.
Operator:  We will now take our next quarter from Liwen Zhang with Blaylock Van.
Liwen Zhang - Blaylock Van: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Would you please comment on your 8-bit business as you did the last quarter? That would be helpful.
Steve Sanghi: Comment on the 8-bit business.
Ganesh Moorthy:  So, you know, we don't break out all the different segments every single quarter. We made an exception to that last quarter about the 8-bit. Suffice to say overall microcontrollers were up and there's a number of moving parts within it. You can see what the growth on 16 and 32 were. You can draw your own conclusions from it. 
Liwen Zhang - Blaylock Van:  Okay, thank you. Also, for the MCU industry and especially you have a lot of exposure to Asia-Pacific, what kind of a competition are you seeing there, also, the pricing strategies, offer to buy local MCU products? Thank you. 
Steve Sanghi:  I seem to recall you asked the same question yesterday in another conference call. The local Asian MCU competitors are not a challenge. There is no new competitors, there is nothing going on. That's not the issue here. We're not really seeing any major competition there. A few commodity guys making low end parts. There's really no formidable Asian competitor, other than the Japanese competitor like Renesas who's really a competitor to us.  I do want to add another comment to Ganesh's answers on 8-bit. We don't want people to walk away with 8-bit having any kind of issues. In the June quarter 8-bit was an all-time record. In September 8-bit was also all-time record, but including a small amount of ISSC revenue which was taken as microcontroller. Without that it was down a little bit. So there is really no immediate 8-bit issue. We don't normally break out the numbers and all that, because of sensitivity on the competition front.
Liwen Zhang - Blaylock Van:  Thanks. That's all I have. 
Steve Sanghi:  You're welcome. 
Operator:  We will now take our final question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig Ellis - B. Riley: Thanks for taking the question and I hopped on late, so I apologize if this was asked and addressed. Steve, could you just put into context the order slow down, and then what appears to be an improvement in that condition recently? How does what you saw compare to what you've seem historically, shorter, longer, more severe, less severe? Can you just put some context around what you're seeing in the business, and the degree to which it's highly localized versus very broad based?
Steve Sanghi: I think we have seen the shallow, couple of quarter correction before, and we're seeing it again. It's nothing like late 2008, and it's nothing like year 2000. But some of these smaller inventory corrections that have come every couple of years or so, it's really one of those. This is a very mild one. And then I think we get out of that with a probably 5%, kind of or less than that, total cut and what we were thinking before was what we're thinking before. You've got to exclude the ISSC, otherwise it complicates numbers. But if you exclude them we missed it by about 4% last quarter. Our current quarter guidance is seasonal or within 0.5% of seasonal. So you're talking 4%, 4.5% kind of total cut. I would consider that to be fairly mild, if it doesn't really go any worse, which we are not expecting.
Craig Ellis - B. Riley: In the past –and I think this was more of a 2007 dynamic, but there have been times when there's been an application-specific issue related to some of the softness that you have seen. Did you detect any of that in the recent period, or was it across various application groups or end markets to the extent that you see them?
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know, so my feeling is that US business is good for everybody, and was good for us. Europe business is also fine. You read the headlines in Europe. Germany is teetering on the brink of recession and all that. I'm not sure all that was seen before. If it gets any worse then it's different, but otherwise Europe business is fine, too. The problem is mostly all in Asia and there are a large number of headlines coming out of China, with a significant GDP drop or slowest industrial production in 5 years, crash in housing, automotive build is low in China. So I think as far as China is concerned, my feeling is with the exception of the companies which are exposed to one guy in Cupertino, excluding that, it's broad based.
Craig Ellis - B. Riley: Okay. And then lastly, in the release in early October, you identified that you thought the business would return to growth in the first calendar quarter. Is that still the expectation, and can you quantify the degree to which you think the business could grow?
Steve Sanghi:  We're not giving a guidance numerically, but we think first quarter should be about seasonal. 
Craig Ellis - B. Riley:  Thank you. 
Operator: We have no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi:  Okay. Well, we want to thank everyone for going through this period and listening to our long commentary here. We'll see some of you at the CSFP in Scottsdale, which we will be attending. It's our home state, and we'll see some of you there. Thank you. 
Operator:  That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Financial Result Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt.
James Eric Bjornholt: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release for today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, provide some additional information on our acquisition activities and discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the June quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance at a record $531.3 million, including $20.2 million of non-GAAP net sales from Supertex, and were up 7.7% sequentially from net sales of $493.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $2.5 million higher than GAAP net sales, as GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs. Revenue by product line was a record $343.8 million for microcontrollers, a record of $127.8 million for analog, $33.4 million for memory, $20.4 million for licensing, and $5.9 million of other. The Supertex non-GAAP revenue was $17.6 million of analog and $2.7 million of foundry services revenue, which we classify in the Other category. Revenue by geography was a record $103.3 million in the Americas, $109.7 million in Europe, and a record $318.3 million in Asia. I'll remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins where above the high end of our guidance at 59.8% in the June quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were at the low end of our guidance at 26.6% of sales. Non-GAAP operating income was above the high end of our guidance at 33.2% of sales, and net income was a record $151.6 million. This resulted in record earnings of $0.68 per diluted share, which is at the high end of our guidance in $0.02 about the midpoint. On a GAAP basis, net sales were $528.9 million, and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 58% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.1 million of share-based compensation and $7.8 million of charges associated with the sell-through of written-up inventory from our acquisitions of Supertex and EqcoLogic. Total operating expenses were $190.6 million, or 36% of sales, and includes acquisition intangible amortization of $36.6 million, share-based compensation of $11.3 million, $0.9 million of acquisition-related expenses, and special charges of $0.3 million, the GAAP net income of $89.9 million, or $0.40 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $4.5 million, which were primarily associated with integrating Supertex into Microchip's corporate structure. In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10.7%, and the GAAP tax rate was 16%. The GAAP tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the $4.5 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profit, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effects of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5%. To summarize the after-tax impact the non-GAAP adjustments we had on Microchip's earnings per share in the June quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.195, share-based compensation was about $0.053, nonrecurring unfavorable tax events were about $0.02, and noncash interest expense was about $0.007. The dividend declared today of $0.356 per share will be paid on September 4, 2014 to shareholders of record on August 21, 2014. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $71.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 48th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend and, in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 42nd occasion we have increased the dividend payment, and our cumulative dividends paid amount to $2.3 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at June 30, 2014 was $264.5 million, or 109 days compared to 118 days at the end of the March quarter. The inventory balance at June 30, 2014 includes $8.5 million of Supertex inventory write-up costs required for GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the Supertex inventory, and its associated GAAP write-up, Microchip had 108 days of inventory on its balance sheet at the end of the quarter. We have taken steps to increase our capacities so our inventory days don't go significantly lower in the September quarter and support the needs of our customers. Inventory at our distributors decreased by 2 days in the June quarter to 31 days and remains at low levels compared to where they had been historically. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. At March 31, the accounts receivable balance was $286.7 million, an increase by $44.3 million on a sequential basis due to the acquisition of Supertex and the revenue growth we experienced in the quarter. Receivable balances remain in great shape. The increase in Microchip's net cash and investment balance in the June quarter, excluding our acquisition of Supertex and our dividend payment was $121.3 million. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $2.29 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit increased to $980 million. The increase in Microchip's borrowing during the June quarter was driven by our acquisition of Supertex. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $160 million to $180 million in the September quarter. Capital spending was approximately $44.6 million for the June quarter, and we expect about $50 million in capital expenditures in the September quarter, and overall capital expenditures for the fiscal year 2015 to be about $175 million as we are adding capital to support the growth of the business, and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $23.3 million. I want to remind our investors and analysts that as Microchip's stock prices changes, there is a diluted share count impact for Microchip's outstanding convertible debt. There is a table on the supplemental financial informations section of Microchip's Investor Relations site that walks through the level of dilution at various stock prices that you may find helpful. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table in today's press release assumes an average Microchip stock price in the September 2014 quarter of $46 per share. However, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter, and provide an update on the Supertex and ISSC acquisition. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our overall microcontroller revenue grew strongly at 5.3% sequentially in the June quarter, and was up 14.5% versus the year-ago quarter, achieving a new revenue record. All 3 microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit experienced sequential growth in the June quarter, and all 3 microcontroller segments achieved record revenue in the June quarter. Microcontrollers represented 64.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. We normally don't provide much color on our 8-bit microcontroller business, but I'm going to make an exception this time, because the results are exceptional and don't always get the attention they deserve. Not only did our 8-bit microcontroller revenue achieve a new record in the June quarter, the cumulative revenue in the last 4 quarters of our 8-bit microcontroller revenue was up 11.5% over the cumulative revenue in the prior 4 quarters. We continue to gain significant share as competitors have defocused in this area, while we have continued to introduce a large number of innovative new products that have captured the imagination of a broad range of customers who have design demand. In fact, demand for our innovative new 8-bit microcontroller products introduced over the last 3 years have been so strong, it has outstripped our ability to ramp manufacturing fast enough. Steve will talk more about that later in his section today. Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 0.6% sequentially in the June quarter, also achieving a new record for revenue. 16-bit microcontroller revenue was up 26.5% versus the year-ago quarter. While the 16-bit microcontroller business took a bit of a pause in the June quarter, this business continues to be an important engine of ongoing growth for us as we continue to find and serve new customers and new applications with our expanding portfolio, and we expect strong growth in the September quarter. Our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 21.5% sequentially in the June quarter, also achieving a new record for revenue. 32-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 59.8% versus the year-ago quarter. This business is now at a size and growth rate where it is making meaningful contribution to our ongoing growth. We are continuing to rapidly expand our new product portfolio, win new designs and expand our presence in fields of play like the Internet of Things to enable further growth in revenue and market share. Overall, we continue to gain significant microcontroller market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Now let's move to analog products. And before, I comment on the analog business, let me reiterate what Eric said in terms of how we will be reporting the Supertex business, as this is the first time we're including it in our results. Approximately 85% to 90% of Supertex' revenue consists of proprietary analog products, which will be consolidated into our analog reporting segment. The remaining approximately 10% to 15% of Supertex business consists of providing specialty foundry services for customers to have their proprietary designs fabricated by Supertex, which will be consolidated into our reporting segment classified as Other. All of what we have reported in the Other category historically, has been our specialty high reliability assembly and test services business that we inherited as a part our acquisition of MMT in Thailand about 3.5 years ago. Now let's get to the performance of our analog business. Including Supertex analog products, our analog business grew 18.9% sequentially in the June quarter and was up 23.8% from the year-ago quarter. Including Supertex analog products revenue, our analog business represented 24% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter, and we crossed a key milestone with over $500 million of annualized analog products revenue. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. Moving to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash memory products, this business was sequentially up 0.7%. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. Now a short update about Supertex and where we are in the integration process. Effective July 1, Supertex operations, expanding from order entry to manufacturing to shipments to billings, are fully integrated into Microchip's business systems. Supertex had a small subscale assembly and test operation in Sunnyvale, California for a small percentage of their manufacturing. The Sunnyvale operations have been closed and the manufacturing done there has been absorbed into Microchip's Thailand facility. Supertex has a leased 6-inch fab in San Jose, California. Prior to our acquisition, Supertex had already started to qualify many of their products at foundries for better competitiveness. After completing a detailed assessment, we have begun qualifying at Microchip's fabs, some of the products that were planned for movement to the foundries. We are also studying a long-term scalability and cost-effectiveness of Supertex 6-inch leased fab and expect to conclude our study by the end of this quarter. Supertex subcontracts 100% of its assembly and over 60% of its test volume. We have identified and started transferring some of the products currently outsourced by Supertex into our internal assembly and test operations in Thailand. We are also studying the long-term scalability and cost effectiveness of Supertex Hong Kong test facility, and expect to conclude our study by the end of this quarter. As I had mentioned in our last conference call, we are retaining Supertex sales and applications engineers and have begun cross-training them, as well as our existing sales force, so that we can find revenue synergies. We have also begun to combine the channel partners of both companies with the goal to achieve expanded distribution capabilities for the products of both companies. Lastly, a short update on our acquisition of Taiwan-based ISSC, which we announced on May 22nd. As you saw in our press release of July 14, we completed a very successful tender offer and now have majority ownership of ISSC. We purchased 83.5% of the outstanding shares as part of the tender offer, and have another 10.5% of outstanding shares pledged to us that we will buy when they are past a lockup agreement that expires on November 27, 2014. The full merger will take place sometime in December 2014, but we are moving ahead full speed with integration planning and integration as the full merger is a mere formality at this point. Since the announcement of the acquisition on May 22, we have spent considerable time understanding ISSC's business, organization and system. We have begun developing detailed integration plans and have begun execution of some of these plans this quarter. In regards to manufacturing, ISSC outsources 100% of its manufacturing. The fab processes used are more advanced than what Microchip's has in-house, and will therefore remain at the professional foundries where they run, which happen to be the same foundries that Microchip also runs at. We're doing a make-versus-buy analysis and evaluating whether some of the assembly and tests currently outsourced by ISSC can be brought into by the internal assembly and test operation. Microchip will transition all ISSC back-end manufacturing systems like wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipment and wafer -- and warehouses to our systems. We estimate that this transition will be complete sometime in the fourth calendar quarter of 2014, at which time, all ISSC products will be shipping from Microchip's business systems. Regarding sales and applications, we are planning to retain ISSC's sales and applications engineers and we'll cross-train them, as well as our existing sales force, so that we can find revenue synergies. We also plan to combine the distribution network for the 2 companies. A few of the distributors for the 2 companies are the same, while most are different, as almost all of the ISSC business was done in Taiwan and China. Our goal is to achieve significantly expanded distribution capabilities for ISSC's products. Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Stephen Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2015, then I will comment on the progress of some of our acquisitions and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2015. We are very pleased with our execution in the June quarter, all of the non-GAAP financial metrics like net sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share were better than the midpoint of our guidance. Without including Supertex results, our non-GAAP gross margin was 60%, achieving a milestone again, and our non-GAAP operating profit was 33.5%. We also made excellent progress on improving Supertex operating results. Supertex non-GAAP gross margin was 54.5%, and non-GAAP operating profit was 24.5%. I remind you that Supertex standalone non-GAAP operating margin in the full calendar year '13 before the acquisition was 17.2%. Combining Supertex results, our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin was 59.8%, and non-GAAP operating profit was 33.2%, and we are making excellent progress towards our long-term goal of 35% operating profit. Consolidated non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $0.68, and was $0.02 better than the midpoint of our guidance. We also made many new all-time records. Total net sales were an all-time record. In microcontrollers, 8, 16, and 32-bit microcontrollers all made new records individually and collectively. Analog product sales also achieved new all-time record. Geographically, our net sales in Americas and Asia each made all-time new record. And in the non-GAAP financials our gross margin dollars, operating profit dollars, net income dollars, and earnings per share, all made fresh all-time records in the quarter. Last, but not the least, the June quarter was our 95th consecutively profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in making this an outstanding quarter. Now, on April 1, we closed the acquisition of Supertex. Ganesh highlighted the status of our integration on Supertex. We have obviously honed our skills and experience through several very successful acquisitions. Supertex contributed $0.013 attrition for the last quarter, which is about $0.01 accretion that we had guided. Now, $0.003 maybe a small difference on Microchip numbers, but it was a substantial beat on the Supertex contribution. Now, I will provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2015. We are seeing a seasonally normal business environment, with strengths in many of our end markets like industrial, automotive, housing, consumer electronics and personal computing. We are seeing exceptional strength in some of our new products and technologies, which are growing at double-digit percentages sequentially. As a result, our product delivery lead times have stretched out and we are selectively capacity constrained in fab, wafer sort, assembly and test operations, particularly on our newest products and technologies. Our inventory of 108 days is below our targeted level of 115, and is expected to go even lower this quarter. So we're ramping all of our factories, but we're limited by equipment lead times. We have increased our planned capital expenditures for fiscal year 2015 to $175 million. We also, just today, posted a Dear Customer letter on our website, www.microchip.com informing our customers about the business environment, our capacity constraints and our lead times. So you may want to look at that later. We are also mindful of summer quarter in Europe that is usually sequentially down. So taking all these factors into account, we expect the September quarter net sales to be up 5.4% to 8.4% sequentially. This includes about $18 million of sales from ISSC, which are on our clock from July 18 to the end of the quarter. So as Ganesh said, Microchip owns 83.5% of the shares of ISSC. Microchip will include the ISSC sales from July 18 onwards in its financial results and consolidate them line by line. We will then back out the profits for the minority interest. I would also like to highlight that ISSC's revenue recognition through distribution is currently on a selling basis. As we integrate their business into Microchip's business systems, we will change the revenue recognition from distribution to a sell-through basis upon modifying the contractual relationships we have with the distributors. We believe that this will happen in the December quarter, and we will share the accounting impact of this with you in the next earnings call. Continuing on the guidance, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 59.2% and 59.6% of sales, the short-term gross margin is slightly negatively impacted from the consolidation of Supertex, as well as ISSC. ISSC gross margin is currently about 45%, longer-term we expect to improve Supertex, as well as ISSC gross margin to Microchip levels. We expect operating expenses to be between 26.3% and 26.7% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 32.5% and 33.3% of sales, again, slightly negatively impacted by Supertex and ISSC short term. Longer-term, we expect Supertex and ISSC's operating margins to be similar to those of Microchip's. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.70 and $0.74 per share, this includes about $0.015 accretion from Supertex, and about $0.01 accretion from ISSC. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Chris Caso at Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I guess our first question, perhaps we could talk about the production constraints you mentioned in your prepared remarks. Does this imply that there's some business that you're not able to address right now? Are you meeting the customer delivery request in general on some of these products that have stretched out? And as a follow-on to that, if you could talk about the steps you could take when lead times start to stretch out and you've seen these constraints in the past, how you make sure that the customers aren't ordering more than they need.
Stephen Sanghi: So, definitely, we are leaving out some revenue due to supply constraints in the September quarter. We cannot really dollarize that number, because we don't really know what other additional customer demand will come in for the fiscal quarter 2, and what product mix that demand will come in. In fact, I mentioned that, we posted a Dear Customer letter on our website today, and this letter will start going out to our customers immediately and, hopefully, we will have a much better idea of the supply constraints in the coming weeks. At the same time, we're also working actually quite hard to improve the supply in expediting equipment from our vendors. So an accurate estimate would be difficult on a short-term basis, but we are definitely leaving out some revenue on the table. The obvious question can be that are we losing any designs or market share because of that? Our microcontroller revenue in the June quarter was up 14.5% versus a year-ago quarter. As you know, from really any market growth numbers, that far exceeds any market data for growth of microcontrollers. So, overall, we're gaining market share and actually gaining substantial market share. The products that we have constraints on are very special products with unique features and very high growth. The products were actually -- these products are killing the competition. The new designs will be in production in about a year or longer for anybody who's thinking or doing a new design with these products. So, short-term constraints, I don't think, are going to impact design wins because our customers know our track record for the last 25 years, and these are shorter-term problems that we will solve them quickly.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. As a follow-up, With respect to the gross margins, and I guess with -- you've given us the ISSC margins, so we could figure out the impact of that on your margin guidance. But for the underlying Microchip margins, with production increasing next quarter, could you talk to us about how that works its way through the income statement? What sort of benefits you see there? And perhaps, how long you'd expect that benefit to continue with the inventory down below your target levels? I suppose this wouldn't be something that you'd get back to normal in just a quarter.
Stephen Sanghi: Well, so, as I mentioned, the inventory this quarter actually will decline further. So we're actually taking inventory from the balance sheet and asking -- adding to your cost of goods sold. So, I would say that core Microchip margins are in the same range where they were last quarter, plus some or minus some, but usually on the good side. And then they are somewhat negatively impacted by integrating a 45% margin on about $18 million sales from ISSC. And there is Supertex effect also because their margin is at 54.5% and also slightly lower than Microchip, but they were in the numbers last quarter also, and we are also picking up a fair amount of old inventory from Supertex that we're shipping now because of first in, first out. So there are a large number of moving products, but overall margin is in excellent shape.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Right. But as the production increases, once the capacity is in place, I guess that would suggest better fixed-cost absorption, improvements to margins once that occurred?
Stephen Sanghi: Yes, the answer to that will be correct. Yes.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs.
James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Question on the equipment. You mentioned some equipment has extended lead times. Are you referring specifically to testing equipment or packaging equipment? Could you give us a little more perspective there?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, it's predominantly fab and test. There is assembly also, but there are few challenges, but it's -- the majority of that is really the fab and test. Test in 2 places, wafer test as well as final test.
James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And then, do you get the sense that your competitors are experiencing the same sort of issues, where -- when you talk to your customers, or do you think your situation is a little bit unique?
Stephen Sanghi: We are not focused on our competitors. We're focused on our customers. I don't really know what competitors are experiencing. I mean, our growth rate is just phenomenal. Some of the numbers I have seen on microcontroller growth rates and analog growth rates from some of the competitors we have announced in the earnings season, and sometimes you have to look at the numbers in a rolling 4 quarter cumulative over the similar 4 quarters prior because a single quarter can play games. Everybody has different seasonality. When you're shipping from -- when you're building product and shipping from inventory, it's the totality of it that counts. So, our numbers are, so far, above the competition. And I think the average, when I did the chart yesterday, that 4 quarter over prior 4 quarter comparison, and the average of that was about 4.5%. And the number for Microchip is 15.2. So, we're doing phenomenal on our products, in our growth, in microcontroller, in analog, and that was not expected a year ago that we'll have those kind of growth rates. And as a result, with long lead times on equipment, we're having some capacity challenges.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach at Morgan Stanley.
Vinayak Rao - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: This is Vinayak calling in for Craig. I had a question on the ISSC. I think you indicated that your guide has $18 million in revenue. What's the related OpEx to that? And like -- as you stop integrated Supertex, like, any negative or positive surprises that have come along?
Stephen Sanghi: So, I think you can calculate that in dollars, but the ISSC's current model is 45% gross margin, 26% expenses, 19% operating profit. That's what they're doing standalone. And you can kind of do the math on it, and we will improve it substantially on our clock, but always take some time.
Vinayak Rao - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. And any negative and positive surprises over the last quarter in Supertex?
Stephen Sanghi: No, we did outstanding. We did a revenue guidance. We did our internal gross margin. We did very well in managing expenses, and accretion was 30% better than what we guided, $0.013 versus $0.01. So you have to divide that by Microchip's 223 million shares, so the numbers become miniscule. But standalone, we did very well on what we set out to do.
Vinayak Rao - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. That's helpful. And my follow-up, so automotive has been a growth engine, like, both for analog and MCU. Can you just touch upon, like, the opportunities you have seen and any new product introduction towards automotive, especially on the 32-bit side?
Stephen Sanghi: Go ahead, Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: So, we play in a broad range of automotive applications. We're not focused on any single item engine control or whatever. In many of the applications, we are the main microcontroller. Those tend to be associated with the body electronics, some of the networking inside of the car. In many of the other applications, we are the auxiliary microcontroller. There's somebody else that's micro, which is a large high-performance microcontroller. So there's no specific single application that is driving the growth. Clearly, we're winning more than our fair share of applications, and the number of cars being built is growing as well. So those are the 2 factors driving the automotive part of our business.
Stephen Sanghi: To add a little bit in the medical field for what Ganesh said, kind of how broadly our products go into automotive, and we're not really focused on really designing one product, if you go buy today an S-Class Mercedes, you'll be buying 51 chips from Microchip. I think there are about 30 or so microcontroller. There are some analog products and there are some others. If you buy a Hyundai Genesis...
Ganesh Moorthy: 54 of them in it.
Stephen Sanghi: 54 different chips from Microchip all over the car. So those are a couple of representative examples where we're not trying to win this by having one part that goes into the car. We are trying to win it by having 30, 40 chips on the car from up and down the car in all different applications. In each of those applications be -- our part be the main part.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar at Stephens Investment Bank.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: I just had a couple of really quick questions. Stephen, in your press release and in your script, you mentioned, you are seeing exceptional strength at some of your newer products. So I'm curious if you could just give us some more color. Is this the -- are these the products you are recently buying or is this like products that are out in the last 3 to 4 years?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, let me make an attempt on it. The conventional wisdom has been that 8-bit microcontroller is declining, and all the customers want is really to convert to 32-bit microcontrollers. And you have heard us over the years, we have disagreed with that conventional wisdom for many years. Our 8-bit as well as our 16-bit microcontroller businesses have performed extremely well, in addition to our 32-bit microcontroller, and Ganesh talked about all of them. In fact all 3 microcontroller types, 8-, 16-, and 32-bit, made new records in the quarter. Now the growth here now in 16- and 32-bit microcontroller has been very good and a lot more predictable. We plan for those kind of high numbers, and we're achieving it. I think the surprise was in the 8-bit because kind of nobody gives it the credit. When we talk to the street, analysts and investors, they're all interested asking about 32-bit. We introduced a significant number of new 8-bit products, including a new very high-efficiency 8-bit core and the entire family of products based on that core that can use C programming language, like the higher end 16- and 32-bit microcontrollers. We also introduced a category of core independent peripherals that allow our customers to run the peripheral functions without the microcontroller core engine running or without consuming the CPU power. These have allowed our customers to expand the use of 8-bit microcontrollers dramatically, and the demand for many of these products have really exploded. These products are built on our latest process technology, proprietary technology that we run in our Gresham fab. So the demand for this process technology is growing at a rate of 15% to 20% per quarter, starting from a fairly large base. The success of these and other 8-bit microcontroller products is unprecedented -- it's unprecedented even measuring at a very successful microcontroller track record, even against that very successful track record at Microchip. We're also seeing that the entire competitive threat of trying to insert the M0 Cortex 32-bit ARM core into the 8-bit microcontroller socket really has petered out. These products had 32-bit engine, but otherwise no peripherals or features. They were largely bait-and-switch kind of products, and customers have seen the hollow offering. The result is that our 8-bit microcontroller business is extremely strong, making new records, and currently capacity constrained, but hopefully not for very long because we're growing capacity rapidly.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Appreciate it, Steve. That was very helpful. And then, as my follow-up, if I can ask you, with the new additions to your Microchip business, Supertex and ISSC, perhaps maybe help us think about how we should think of the seasonality. Is it still largely unchanged? Or will you see more of sort of a consumer effect now in the December quarter?
Stephen Sanghi: Every acquisition modifies it a little bit. These acquisitions are not extremely large, but ISSC is very consumer-ish, and it will change the seasonality a little bit. Supertex does not change it as much. They're kind of similar to ours, much more industrial. SMSC did change the seasonality a little bit. They were a little more on PCs than we were. Yes, so these all have impacts.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from JoAnne Feeney of ABR Investment Strategy.
JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC: Follow-up question on the capacity constraints. So it sounds like from your last answer there, mostly this is hitting on the 8-bit side. Is it not possible for you at this point to change the mix and shift some of your capacity over to that which is being constrained? Or are you seeing a broader-based constraint that's really hitting all of your products? And if you could just clarify really where those constraints are kicking in and why mix can't be changed or why it's not worthwhile, to do that at this point, that'd be helpful.
Stephen Sanghi: Well, so, these -- many of the products that are growing 15% to 20% sequentially are built on our latest advanced technology, so you can't really use the older capacity for these, and we have to add new capacity. Within the products itself, obviously, we're changing mix to build the products, which are stronger, but I think they're all largely doing very well. We're constrained overall on the products on their technology. So even after changing the mix within, the entire number of wafers, we got to run on that technology are 20%, 30% higher than really what I can run today. And we just made an increase just this last month. There is another one happening on August 1, which is tomorrow. We increase the wafer starts. There's another one scheduled for October 1, another one scheduled for January 1. So we are bringing this new equipment, adding it and some of that has been in the works for months, if not quarters, and we've been constantly adding, and we keep thinking that demand will moderate. But from a fairly large base, the demand has continued, which is really the strength of the products. I mean, everybody bad mouths 8-bit, and competitors have backed off, and everybody wants to sell a Cortex core. We defied that conventional wisdom. We were right. We are so successful at that. 8-bit is adding the largest dollar revenue in growth. And we're the only man standing almost.
JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC: That's really helpful. If I can just get a follow-up in on the 16-bit side, obviously, that's grown very strongly as you said in the trailing 12 months year-over-year. I'm wondering if you could elaborate on what you think the pause was. Is this just a timing issue of particular design wins that aren't starting for a bit? Or is this a specific end market that might be weak or a specific application, and why you're confident that, that's going to pick up again in this quarter?
Ganesh Moorthy: There are smaller changes quarter-to-quarter when people's timings, et cetera, of when they want to purchase may be adjusted. But if you go back and look, it's had a very strong quarter before that. We're expecting a strong quarter. So what falls into any one 90-day period isn't reflective of the business. I think if you look at it over a 12-month period of time, it evens all that out. And so we see the design wins. We see the customers ramping. We're confident in the product line going forward.
Stephen Sanghi: We have seen the same thing on 32-bit. 32-bit did very well last quarter. But if you look at the quarter before, 32-bit had a very low single-digit growth. So these smaller product lines, 16, 32, although they're fairly sizable, their growth rate doesn't seem to match the corporate and the seasonality. Overall, both are doing very well year-over-year, but quarters are uncertain. So on 16-bit, our current quarter backlog is up by double digit. I'm not saying it will end there, but I think it will end very well.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from William Stein at SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: I'm hoping you can give us a little bit more granularity or detail to try to understand the degree to which these lead times are -- the stretch lead times or the shortages are felt broadly across the portfolio. Is it relatively narrow number of products that are affected, or is it broadly speaking? And maybe if you can quantify to what degree you've seen lead times stretch.
Stephen Sanghi: So, the letter we posted today, it says our lead times are from 6 weeks to 18 weeks plus. And Microchip sells over 100,000 SKUs, so it's really kind of all over the place. Anytime people want a headline number, our lead times are x weeks. There's really no such thing. When you have 100,000 SKUs, there are parts that you can get off the shelf because in any mix situation, there's always some parts available. But in any reasonable volume, we can do it in as little as 6 weeks, and many of them are 18 weeks plus. But these constraints are fairly significant, I would say.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And following up on that, perhaps you can give us a sense as to when you expect that supply will be more in line with demand. You talked about adding capacity. I think, tomorrow, you said, you're adding some new capacity and then you have something planned for, I think you said, January. When would you expect to see a relative balance between supply and demand?
Stephen Sanghi: The supply-demand balances are hard to predict. I know what additional supply we're bringing in because we know the wafer start ramp and similar ramp in the assembly and test. Now matching it against to what demand may materialize, that's a difficult one. We don't know what demand does in December quarter and in March quarter next year. Will the rate of growth of these products continue? It looks like we dramatically beat our own internal expectations. A year ago, what we predicted regarding these products will do, we were wrong. They are doing significantly extremely better than that. I mean, if a year ago I would have told you that the 8-bit can grow in double digits, you wouldn't have believed it. So I can't tell you exactly the time frame when the problems get resolved, but we are adding a lot of new capacity and they will get better.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: If I could just sneak one more quick one in. I mean, you're known as kind of the cycle maven in semis. You've done very well predicting this for all the investors in the past. It feels very much now like the market is telling us that something is going to roll over soon. Your results certainly don't seem to foretell that. To what degree does this, to you, feel like sort of the last run before the tightness gets resolved and suddenly you wind up having a pause in demand versus kind of a more beginning stages of extended improving demand?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, I carry a heavy burden on my shoulders for semi vision, but I'm not seeing any rollover right now. I think, wind is on our back.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ray Rund at Shaker Investments.
Raymond Joseph Rund - Shaker Investments, L.L.C.: Steve, I -- actually most of my questions have been answered. I was just curious if you could just repeat what the breakdown was in terms of the different revenue by product area that you went through at the beginning. You kind of did it pretty fast.
James Eric Bjornholt: This is Eric, I can do that. So microcontrollers were $343.8 million, Analog was $127.8 million, memory was $33.4 million, licensing was $20.4 million, and other was $5.9 million.
Raymond Joseph Rund - Shaker Investments, L.L.C.: As a follow-up question, can -- you mentioned that your -- the analog, excluding Supertex, was up very -- I think less than 1% sequentially. Is there any reason why analog has slowed down in the last couple of quarters?
Ganesh Moorthy: Like we mentioned for our 16-bit product line, if you -- I think quarter-to-quarter, there are going to be sometimes a larger than expected growth and sometimes a smaller than expected growth. This isn't the totality of how it's been doing year-over-year on an annualized basis, and you'll find that the analog business has had fantastic growth throughout this time.
Raymond Joseph Rund - Shaker Investments, L.L.C.: Well, that's quite true. And...
Stephen Sanghi: It was not 1%, by the way. Our analog business without Supertex grew 2.6% sequentially.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Rajvindra Gill at Needham & Company.
Unknown Analyst: Josh [ph] in for Raji. Most of them have been answered, but could you please give us some color on end markets. I know you mentioned a little bit with auto before, but more color there would be helpful.
Stephen Sanghi: So I think -- I kind of mentioned we are seeing strength in industrial. We're seeing strength in auto. We're seeing strength in housing. We ship a lot of parts into -- also to housing, appliances, garage door openers, security systems and all the kind of stuff. We're seeing strength in consumer electronics and kind of things we do. We don't go into the cell phone, but the other consumer electronics and the unique one is personal computing. I think if you listen to the Intel commentary and their results, the PCs are going through refresh cycles. So our PC exposure has gone up with the acquisition of SMSC. In fact, 2 different divisions of SMSC. One that does the embedded controller for the PCs, and the other division does Ethernet, LAN, USB and all that. We have seen that market strengthening also. So we're seeing strength in many of these end markets. I believe the market that kind of has been weak was the smartphone. And that's where Microchip doesn't have exposure. So I think, we've done well largely because we try to stay away from that market. We don't like its margins. We don't like its customers. We don't like a number of things about it.
Unknown Analyst: That's very helpful. And then lastly, on SMSC, last quarter, I think you mentioned you thought you're about halfway to the point where it was -- had a reasonable potential for accretion. Can you maybe update us there where that progress is? Has it been complicated at all by Supertex?
James Eric Bjornholt: I'll let Ganesh respond to that, but what we said last quarter is we were halfway there on kind of integrating back-end assembly and test manufacturing.
Ganesh Moorthy: That is exactly what we said. And so -- and we were actually a little less than 50% at that point in time. Those -- not everything that is outsourced makes sense to bring in-house. We go -- we do that case by case, and there's some accretion in SMSC that over time will come as we sell those designs to a broader set of customers using Microchip sales teams and all of that. But SMSC has done exceedingly well and better than what we had expected in its contribution to Microchip.
Stephen Sanghi: So SMSC's gross and operating margins are now at the Microchip level. And further improvements are possible as we bring some of the small stuff in. But already, SMSC's gross and operating margins are right on the top of Microchip.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Gill Alexandre at Darphil Associates.
Gilbert Alexandre: Could you update us on your long-term model, what you'd like to have your gross margins at and your operating expenses? And you mentioned your operating profit goals of 35% now?
Stephen Sanghi: So, Gill, let me sort of remind everyone, we haven't changed it, so our long-term gross margin model is 61.5%, plus/minus 0.5%. Our operating expense target is 26.5%, plus/minus 0.5%. And our operating margin target is 35%, plus/minus 1%, if you just look at all the low and high. What's really -- what's holding us back a little bit are really the acquisitions. It's very difficult to go out and find an acquisition that's performing at Microchip kind of financials today. In fact, we have found none. So the acquisitions we buy, SST, SMSC, Supertex, ISSC, did all in the gross margins between 45% and 55%, operating margins in teens, pretty much all of them. And SST was worse than that. It wasn't making any money. And then, we take on the task through pruning and expense reduction and margin improvement and moving them to our factories and choosing what to make and not to make, and selecting the product lines, and getting our sales and applications infrastructure to go sell them better to get them into our operating profit. We did that with SST. We did that with SMSC. We're making huge improvement with Supertex, as I mentioned. The operating margin was 17%, and now it's 25%. And we've got to go the rest of the way. In ISSC, we have just begun, we close the deal about a week ago.
Gilbert Alexandre: Could you give me an idea of how much money you have overseas?
Stephen Sanghi: Lots.
James Eric Bjornholt: The vast majority of our cash and investment balance is offshore, and that's why we're borrowers in the U.S. So we manage our U.S. balance to keep our borrowings as low as possible, but the vast majority of cash is offshore.
Gilbert Alexandre: And your estimated depreciation for fiscal '15?
James Eric Bjornholt: It depends on the capital that we're bringing in and how that ramps on. But it's probably going to be somewhere between $97 million and $100 million, so it will be up year-over-year.
Gilbert Alexandre: And could you remind me what ISSC sales are?
Stephen Sanghi: So in the -- so one is the public number for the last quarter, which is known, which is what?
Ganesh Moorthy: The last public number is for the June quarter. I know in NT dollars, that's TWD 638 million.
James Eric Bjornholt: So about $21 million. And I think in the last calendar year they were about $70 million -- $69 million.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes, just over $69 million.
Stephen Sanghi: So the June quarter, publicly announced sales were about $21 million. And this quarter would be higher than that, but we have to reassure the sales from July 18 to the end of the quarter, and that we have guided to be $18 million.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Pitzer at Crédit Suisse.
John William Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Steve, a lot of them have been answered. But as you guys integrate more and more of these acquisitions, thinking about the core Microchip revenue is becoming harder and harder, but when I looked to the September guidance, if you kind of look at kind of the -- take out the acquisition revenue, I'm getting to sort of a flat core sequential growth. One, is that right? And two, even if it's not, I'm just kind of curious, given the capacity constraints, how much better could the September guidance have been if you didn't have some of the capacity constraints?
Stephen Sanghi: So the answer to your first question, I think, Microchip core business is growing quite substantially, so I don't know where you're coming up with flat, if you did that just for a quarter, so I don't know. But if you look at 4 quarters over 4 quarters, fiscal year '14 over fiscal year '13, we've had very, very substantial growth net of acquisition.
John William Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Steve, I was talking more sequential June to September.
Stephen Sanghi: Oh, June to September.
Ganesh Moorthy: That's up 3.5%.
James Eric Bjornholt: Midpoint of that guidance is 3.5% plus the $18 million coming on from ISSC.
Stephen Sanghi: So Supertex was -- and that may be the confusion. So Supertex was closed on April 1. So the entire Supertex was included in our June numbers. So including Supertex, June to September, the midpoint of our growth is 3.5%, not flat. And then, add 18% on the top of that -- $18 million, which takes the overall growth to about 6.9%.
John William Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: What could the 3.5% have been had you not had some of the capacity constraints that you do?
Stephen Sanghi: Well, that's -- I can't tell you that. I don't know.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Kevin Cassidy at Stifel.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: The ISSC, how much of their product will be attached, do you think, to your microcontrollers or will it be similar to when you first came into the analog market? And eventually, this will sell on its own or do you expect that 1 plus 1 equals 3 with your microcontrollers plus ISSC?
Ganesh Moorthy: Clearly, we expect many of the products will marry up with a microcontroller sometimes with our memory as well as sometimes with our analog. The applications they go into, in many cases, we have served, but without the solution that ISSC has brought. But I think the large opportunity in ISSC also is to take it outside of Taiwan and China, which is where the predominant revenue for them is all coming from. And there, we have our sales channels and customer relationships, where existing products that customers are building but missing the components that ISSC builds, automatically becomes a quick addition that we can make. So we're expecting that many, many ISSC products will be sold next to our microcontrollers.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, great. And can you give us some idea what the cost split is between front end and back end? You say you're going to move the back-end portion to internal manufacturing?
Ganesh Moorthy: So we don't break that out. And even the timeline for when it can be done -- not everything that ISSC manufactures will make sense to move in-house. So we go systematically, item by item, with the objective of making sure that we get to a lower cost, bringing it in-house, and a percentage of what they do will make sense and some of it will not. But that analysis is not complete, and we don't break out the back end versus front end components of that.
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue.
Stephen Sanghi: Okay. Well, thank you very much for attending our conference call. We'll see some of you on the road as we're doing any conferences. Otherwise, we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt.
James Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2014 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, provide some additional information on our April 1 acquisition of Supertex and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Net sales on the March quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance at a record $493.4 million and were up 2.3% sequentially from net sales of $482.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Revenue by product line was a record $326.4 million from microcontrollers, $107.5 million for analog, $33.1 million for memory, $23.2 million for licensing and $3.2 million of other. Revenue by geography was a record $92.8 million in the Americas, a record $115.9 million in Europe and $284.6 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of the contract manufacturing takes place. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were above the high end of our guidance at 59.3% in the March quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were below the low end of our guidance at 26.6% of sales. Non-GAAP operating income was above the high end our guidance at 32.7% of sales and net income was a record $141.3 million. This resulted in record earnings of $0.64 per diluted share, which was $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance. For fiscal 2014, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $1.931 billion, and up 20.2% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58.8%, operating expenses were 27.1% of sales, and operating income was 31.8% of sales. Net income was a record $531 million, or $2.45 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 58.9% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $1.7 million of share-based compensation, and $0.3 million of charges associated with the sell-through of written-up inventory from our acquisition of EqcoLogic, which closed in the December quarter. Total operating expenses were $164.5 million or 33.4% of sales, and include acquisition intangible amortization of $21.3 million, share-based compensation of $10.7 million, $0.9 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $0.5 million. The GAAP net income was $111.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $5.8 million. For fiscal year 2014, GAAP gross margins were 58.4%, operating expenses were 34.7% of sales, and operating income was 23.8% of sales. Net income was $395.3 million, or $1.82 per diluted share. In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 9.8% and the GAAP tax rate was 5.7%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $5.8 million of nonrecurring favorable tax events that I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect to various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10% to 10.5%, which is lower than our previously communicated model. The tax rate will be slightly higher than this in Q1 of fiscal 2015, as we will not have integrated Supertex into Microchip's tax structure. To summarize the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the March quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.101, share-based compensation was about $0.05, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.026, noncash interest expense was about $0.006 and other items were $0.002. The dividend declared today of $0.3555 per share will be paid on June 3, 2014 to shareholders of record on May 21, 2014. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $71.1 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 47th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We've never made a reduction in our dividend, and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 41st occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividends paid is over $2.2 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. Moving onto the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at March 31, 2014 was $262.7 million, or 118 days, compared to 126 days at the end of the December quarter. Excluding Supertex, we expect days of inventory at the end of the June quarter to be down between 7 and 11 days based on our revenue guidance range. Inventory at our distributors stayed flat during the March quarter at 33 days and remains at low levels compared to where they have been historically. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. The combined overall inventory position of Microchip and its distributors is in great shape. At March 31, the accounts receivable balance was $242.4 million, an increase by $18.1 million on a sequential basis due to the back-end weighting of the quarter due to the Lunar New Year holidays. Receivable balances remain in great condition. The increase in Microchip's net cash and investment balance in the March quarter was a record $183.1 million prior to our dividend payment. The cash generation was favorably impacted by tax refunds received in the quarter of $28.6 million. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $2.14 billion, and we had $650 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the June quarter. Capital spending was approximately $34.7 million for the March quarter and was $114.3 million for fiscal year 2014. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2015 to be about $125 million, as we are adding capital to support the growth of the business and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $23 million. I want to remind our investors and analysts that as Microchip's stock price rises, there is dilution for Microchip's outstanding convertible debt that come into the Microchip's diluted share count. There is a table on the supplemental financial information section of Microchip's Investor Relations site that walks through the level of dilution at various stock prices that you may find helpful. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table in today's press release assumes an average Microchip stock price in the June 2014 quarter of $48 per share. However, we make no predictions as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter and provide an update on the Supertex acquisition.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our overall microcontroller revenue grew 4.2% sequentially in the March quarter and was up 18.3% versus the year-ago quarter, achieving a new revenue record. For fiscal year '14, our microcontroller revenue was up 20.8% as compared to fiscal year '13, also achieving an all-time record. All 3 microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit experienced sequential growth in the March quarter. And all 3 microcontroller segments achieved record revenue in fiscal year '14. Microcontrollers represented 66.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 16.4% sequentially in the March quarter, achieving a new record for revenue. 16-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 38.3% versus the year-ago quarter, and for fiscal year '14, our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 44.2% as compared to fiscal year '13. Fiscal year '14 marks the 9th consecutive year of revenue growth and new revenue records for our 16-bit microcontroller business. We now have over 400 16-bit microcontroller products in our portfolio and this business continues to be an important engine of ongoing growth for us as we continue to find and serve new customers and new applications with our expanding portfolio. Our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 7% sequentially in the March quarter, also achieving a new record for revenue. 32-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 66% versus the year-ago quarter. And for fiscal year '14, our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 73% as compared to fiscal year '13. Fiscal year '14 marks the fifth consecutive year of revenue growth and new revenue records for our 32-bit microcontroller business. We now have well over 100 32-bit microcontroller products in our portfolio and we're continuing to rapidly expand our new product portfolio, win new designs, and expand into new fields of play, like the Internet of Things to enable further growth in revenue and market share. Gartner Dataquest just released a microcontroller market share report for 2013. While we remained in the #2 position for 8-bit microcontrollers, we continue to gain significant share versus the 8-bit market at large and versus our nearest competitors. Three years ago, it took the combination of 3 Japanese semiconductor giants, NEC, Hitachi, and Mitsubishi, to knock us off the #1 spot for 8-bit microcontrollers. We assured you at that time that we would work relentlessly to gain market share and to wrest back the #1 spot in the coming years. Post their merger, Renesas 8-bit business in 2010 used to be 41% larger than our 8-bit microcontroller business. In 2013, this lead had shrunk to less than 0.5%. I fully expect that we will wrest back the #1 position in 8-bit microcontrollers in 2014. In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we were again the fastest-growing 16-bit microcontroller supplier among the top 10 suppliers in 2013. We also moved up to the #5 spot in 2013, and expect to continue to gain share and move further up the rankings in the coming years. In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we moved up to the #11 spot in 2013, and we were the fastest-growing major 32-bit microcontroller franchise among the top competitors. Gartner Dataquest report is a backward-looking indicator where we're performing very well. Now let's look at a forward-looking indicator. In early April, UBM Tech, which is the parent company of EE Times, released the results of their annual Embedded Market Study. Once again, Microchip was rated by embedded system design engineers as their #1 choice for new designs using 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the performance range that we compete in. We are humbled and gratified by the overwhelming preference by engineers for our solutions, and see this as a positive sign for future growth, especially for our 32-bit microcontroller franchise, where some have had questions about our choice of core. Our 2013 market results as well as the 2013 design engineering preference results echo market confirmation of our belief about customers care about, is that we offer a PIC microcontroller solution with all the attendant brand promises and that the choice of core is not as important. Our overall microcontroller results as well as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit results are clearly outperforming the market with year-over-year growth rates well above the market and what we have seen reported by our competitors in their results. We have gained significant market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Now let's move to analog products. After 9 consecutive quarters of sequential growth, our analog business took a pause and was down 1.3% sequentially in the March quarter. However, analog revenue was up 10.6% from the year-ago quarter, and for fiscal year '14, our analog business was up 32% as compared to fiscal year '13, easily one of the best-performing analog franchises in the industry. Analog revenue represented 21.8% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We are continuing to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. Moving to our memory business. This business is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, and was sequentially up 2%. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. Now a short update about Supertex and where we are in the integration process. Since the announcement of the acquisition on February 10, we have spent considerable time understanding Supertex's business, organization and systems. We have developed a detailed integration plan that we have begun to execute starting April 1 when we closed the transaction. Supertex will run as one of our analog product groups, otherwise known as divisions, focused on markets and applications that value high-voltage analog and mixed signal capability. We believe a number of Supertex's current products and future roadmap have broader market appeal than how they have been marketed, and we are taking steps to capitalize on this opportunity. In regards to manufacturing, Supertex does have a leased 6-inch fab, but had already started to move many of their products to foundries for better competitiveness. We are evaluating whether some of the products planned for movement to the foundries can be redirected to Microchip's fabs instead. Supertex subcontracts 100% of its assembly and over 60% of its test volume. We are doing a make-versus-buy analysis and evaluating whether some of the products currently outsourced by Supertex can be brought into our internal assembly and test operations. Microchip will transition all Supertex back-end manufacturing systems like wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses to our systems. We estimate that this transition will be complete sometime in the third calendar quarter of 2014, at which time all Supertex products will be shipping from Microchip's manufacturing systems. Regarding sales of field applications, we are planning to keep Supertex's sales and applications engineers and will cross-train them as well as our existing sales force so that we can find revenue synergies. We also plan to combine the distribution network for the 2 companies. Some distributors for the 2 companies are the same, while some are different, our goal is to achieve expanded distribution capabilities for the products of both companies. Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, more specifics about the Supertex acquisition, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll will first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 and the whole of the fiscal 2014, then I'll will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2015. We are very pleased with our execution in the March quarter, as well as fiscal year 2014, all of the non-GAAP financial metrics like net sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share were better than the midpoint of our guidance. Our operating profit percentage was 32.7% and we are making excellent progress towards our long-term goal of 35% operating profit. Non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $0.64 and was $0.03 better than the midpoint of our guidance. We made the following new all-time records: total net sales; total microcontroller sales; 16-bit microcontroller sales and 32-bit microcontroller sales. All made fresh all-time records in the quarter. Geographically, our net sales in the Americas and Europe made all-time new records in the quarter in the non-GAAP financials of our gross margin dollars, operating profit dollars, net income dollars and earnings per share, all made fresh all-time records in the quarter. On a full fiscal year basis, our overall net sales in fiscal 2014 were a record $1.93 billion and were up 20.2% over net sales in fiscal year 2013, marking an excellent year of market share growth compared to a low single-digit growth for the industry.  In fiscal year '14, we achieved new records on every strategic product line, 8-bit MCUs, 16-bit MCUs, 32-bit MCUs, and total MCUs, analog, as well as licensing. They all made records in fiscal 2014. Yes, we shipped a record 8-bit microcontrollers also in fiscal year 2014. We also made new records in each of the geographies of Americas, Europe and Asia also. Last, but not the least, the March quarter was our 94th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in making this an outstanding year for microchip. On April 1, we closed the acquisition of Supertex. I will provide more guidance on Supertex a bit later and provide the overall guidance. So now the fiscal first quarter 2015 guidance. The June quarter started with a good backlog position. There is usually sequential growth coming out of Asia because of the effect of Lunar New Year in the March quarter. Taking all this into account, we expect the June quarter net sales to be up 5.3% to 8.3% sequentially. Now this includes about $16.5 million of sales coming from Supertex. Without Supertex, Microchip classic business is expected to be up between 2% to 5% sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 59.3% and 59.5% of sales. Classic Microchip gross margin is expected to improve to about 59.5% to 60% of sales. But the short-term gross margin is slightly negatively impacted from the consolidation of Supertex. Supertex took the underutilization of their fab and capitalized it in their inventory. Microchip does accounting more conservatively and will charge the underutilization in the current quarter. Longer term, we expect to improve Supertex's gross margin to Microchip levels. We expect operating expenses to be between 26.6% and 27% of sales, and we expect operating profit to be between 32.3% and 32.9% of sales, again, slightly negatively impacted by Supertex short term. Longer term, we expect Supertex's operating margins to be similar to those of Microchip's. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.64 and $0.68 per share, including the accretion from Supertex. Now regarding Supertex, Ganesh provided you an update, on where we are on the integration process. Supertex will provide about $0.01 accretion in the June quarter, which we expect will go to about $0.02 accretion by the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect the accretion by the end of the second year to be at a rate of about $0.03 per quarter or about $0.12 per year run rate. These numbers are non-GAAP and they depend on the pace of integration and general market conditions, which will impact Supertex's and Microchip's business. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call. With this, operator, will you please pool for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will now take our first question from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
Andrew Paik: This is Andrew Paik on behalf of John Pitzer. Thanks again for providing us on the expected accretion levels from Supertex. I was wondering if you could help us understand what kind of gross margin and operating margin you're embedding in your calculation relative to the $0.02 accretion you are expecting exiting the second full year.
Steve Sanghi: Is the question short term? Or what we are embedding, longer term and year out?
Andrew Paik: It's the longer-term, it's relative to the $0.02 accretion you provided for exiting the second full year after the acquisition.
Steve Sanghi: They're very much similar to Microchip's gross margin level, 60% plus kind of range.
Andrew Paik: Got it. And as my follow-up, I think, it will be helpful if you could provide us how -- if you saw any strengths, I guess better-than-expected strengths in any particular end market during the March quarter. You have an outside exposure to auto, industrial and housing, so perhaps, it will be helpful if you could provide us -- help us in this and how those end markets perform during the March quarter relative to your expectations heading into the quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the answer is really kind of all of the above that you mentioned. Housing, auto, industrial, they've been all been small markets. You have heard commentary from other manufacturers and ours was similar. We do not track our business for end markets. We are not organized that way. We have a very broad customer base of 80,000-plus customers. So we could just basically say that, generically, those are the stronger end markets today, and our business has really benefited from those exposures.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: First question, I wonder if you could talk a little bit with regard to the Supertex accretion. And as you get to the final $0.12 a year that you expect, how much of that contribution do you expect from cost synergies, improving the margins, getting the margins up to Microchip levels as compared to some of the improved revenue growth, because I think both -- you are looking to make progress on both fronts there?
Steve Sanghi: That's correct. We are planning to make progress in both fronts. It's only been 1 month. We closed the deal on April 1. So in such a short time, we're really not able to provide you further breakdown of really where some of the synergies could come from. There are synergies out of wafer manufacturing, synergies out of assembly and test, synergies out of OpEx overhead, and synergy out of increased sales at the existing new customers by -- we have already seen and evaluated that Supertex products were marketed to a relatively narrower group of customers. And they have a tremendous high-voltage expertise and some of the products have a much broader reach, and we'll win the designs into broad Microchip 80,000-plus customers with many other broad-based products. So it's really all of the above.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And with regard to the results and guidance. If you could go into a little detail about why there was divergence between the analog and the microcontroller business in the March quarter? I suppose perhaps that's some of the seasonality of some of your acquired businesses, but if you could go into a little bit of detail there? And what your expectation is for analog versus microcontroller as you go into the June quarter?
Steve Sanghi: We don't break out our guidance by the various product lines. But looking back at it, the March quarter, analog has grown now straight for about 9 quarters. And cumulatively over that period, actually analog growth has been a little higher than microcontrollers. So not every quarter always perfectly falls in its place. And the large number of moving things and seasonality of different business lines, different customers are different. It's somewhat also impacted by the acquired businesses, which have slightly different seasonality than our own like you mentioned. So those were the numbers in March and we don't break it out going forward. The analog business historically is very strong in the first quarter -- fiscal first quarter, so this quarter you should see positive analog results.
Ganesh Moorthy: If you go back in our history, you'll also see there've been quarters where 16-bit has taken a pause or 32-bit has taken a pause, so over the long run and as you look at our fiscal year over fiscal year, they all look very good. But at any given quarter, we can have a pause for any of the segments.
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes, and just point out that analog in the December quarter was an all-time record revenue, so just backing off to slightly from that.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Stephens Incorporated.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: We -- Steve, we've always valued your commentary on the end markets. There was a question asked earlier. I'm curious if you have a mid- to longer-term prognosis based on what you're seeing or your views on the semi cycle at this time.
Steve Sanghi: I'm surprised you value my commentary on the end markets because [ph] I don't get any.
James Eric Bjornholt: I think he's talking about just semiconductor program, the cycle.
Steve Sanghi: Yes, but you're talking about the general semiconductor cycle?
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: That is correct. That is correct.
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think cycle is still on the way up. There are no major cyclical headwinds visible today. You're seeing a strong Europe recovering, all the peripheral countries are doing better. Europe was up -- huge for us in the March quarter. U.S. is doing well, we made record revenue both in U.S. and Europe in the March quarter. And for a -- on a year basis, all geographies were record -- U.S., Europe and Asia. Asia was down in the March quarter, largely because of the Lunar New Year, and Asia would make another record in the June quarter. So I think, geographies are doing well, end markets are doing well, our business is doing well. We're gaining share. The inventories and the channel as well as -- at Microchip are very reasonable. We had 118 days of inventory. We're guiding down inventory by another 7 to 11 days. So I think, things are in reasonably good shape. There will eventually be a cycle, but I don't think it's from the next quarter or 2.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then if I can ask a question. You briefly touched on Internet of Things, IoT, and that's like a new, big buzz word now. I'm curious if your strategy of sort of getting into that market and growing your business, your beachhead will be the microcontroller business or the analog business or something else?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes, so we're not getting into the business. We've been in it for a long time. So let me kind of paint how the business looks to us. Many, many, many of these devices that are trying to be connected to the Internet are products in which we have designed in our standard microcontrollers and our analog products for many years. The 4 major components that enable our customers to achieve connectivity to the Internet and be part of the Internet of Things are the computing capability, which is all microcontrollers. The analog functionality, which goes hand in hand in many of their systems. The wireless connectivity and the associated software and firmware that goes with it, which establishes the connectivity through different medium. And finally, the ability to get on to the cloud, which is really where we partner with external partners who will bring that capability, so that they're scalable cloud services that are available to these same customers. So a lot of the people who are achieving connectivity of the Internet are the people who we have dealt with for many years, have their designs, and are winning their new designs as they take the next step of getting to Internet connectivity.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Harsh. I'd like to add one other comment there. I think Microchip fights and defends a very, very broad beachhead. And our $2 billion business doesn't tend to be dependent on neither a single vertical market or single stuff like Internet of Things or anything like that. We are in hundreds and hundreds of appliances, thousands of applications. So as a result, any one given thrust [ph] doesn't get as much air time. But if you look at today, the connectivity of thermostats to washing machines to laundry equipment to garage-door openers to security systems, Microchip is providing the backbone, the microcontroller, the analog, the Wi-Fi, the connectivity, the software and everything to connect these things to Internet. So -- and we have a substantial business in that area, but we don't go out there and say we are pure play in Internet because that's neither true, nor is something we would like. Our business is very broad-based.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Can you talk about your cash position? How much is onshore and how much is offshore? And what's the trend, is there a -- Supertex helped to bring more cash onshore?
James Eric Bjornholt: Okay, sure, I can answer that. So the vast majority of Microchip's cash is offshore. We have our line of credit that's outstanding, which is about $650 million and we've tapped into that line of credit for our strategic opportunities, specifically the SMSC acquisition in the past and now it will be the Supertex acquisition in the current quarter that we're in. But the vast majority of our cash is offshore. Supertex, we don't expect to really improve the onshore cash generation. It will improve the overall cash generation. But their business profile in terms of how much is offshore versus onshore is similar to what Microchip's is, so it should really maintain that structure.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And is there any other strategy to bring cash back onshore?
James Eric Bjornholt: No, there is not another strategy at this point in time. The domestic cash generation that we have, it supports the dividend program, it supports the investments that we need to make in our ongoing business. But the strategic activity for acquisitions -- we'll continue to look at ways to do those things in a cash-effective manner, but each acquisition is different but that's something that is evaluated with each one.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from JoAnne Feeney with ABR.
JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC: I had a question for you, though, about the sequence of revenues into this quarter. Traditionally, when you look at your seasonal patterns over the last several years and even the last couple of years, we've seen a stronger uptick in the March quarter -- sorry, in the June quarter. And it seemed like that might even have been bigger this year because of the steeper drop you faced in March because of the new exposure to China New Year and Asia consumer electronics. Do you have a sense for -- or do you see any drivers as to why we didn't see that stronger bounce back in the organic growth of Microchip excluding Supertex or if there are any order pull-ins that explain your above-guidance results last quarter that could help us understand that sequential softness, I guess, here in June?
Steve Sanghi: I guess we're not looking at June. We are not interpreting them to be soft. If you, in fact, take the March to June results for the last 3 years, you will see that the average growth in net sales that we have experienced in the June quarter over the past 3 years is right in line with a 3.5% guidance. And then add Supertex to that, about $16.5 million, and that's really sort of the formation. So it's not really weaker than the prior. The case you're making is, why is it not stronger. I seem to recall that same industrial, auto and consumer were in the play last year also and there were quite strong. Our last June quarter was pretty good, too. So I think, it's been about a year that these end markets have been stronger, it's really not a new thing. In addition, not really any pull-ins, but we beat the March quarter from the original midpoint of guidance of 1.5%, so we're starting with a higher base.
JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC: Right, that's helpful. And then on the order pattern or the pace of business, can you give us any color on how orders might have evolved over the last few months or over the course of March and then beginning here the June quarters, whether you are seeing any expedited orders or any push-outs? And whether that's prompting you to increase capacity utilization at your fabs?
Steve Sanghi: Okay. That's a good question. Our order pattern is very strong. I mean, noticeably the overall total backlog has a steep slope upwards, but the backlog is not aging all in the June quarter. We're getting more longer-term orders somewhat related to just overall strong orders. So the lead times are not short on many of the products. So with the environment being stronger in industrial, auto, consumers and others, pretty broad-based from all geographies. We are seeing customers willing to place orders more out in time than they historically are. Partially because customers have also got to know that June, September are stronger quarters and they have seen in the previous years, when I was writing these letters, then posting them on the web to customers all the time, leading up to this time, asking the customers to place their longer-term backlog and they always saw the orders or the lead time push out and some customers were stranded with very short inventory. This time I didn't write the letter because we were basically getting very strong orders and with a very good outlook in the future. Some of the orders of going all the way into October, November, December. So order patterns are very strong and we should have good visibility, which will stage for a good June and a good September.
JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC: And on capacity utilization, is that moving higher?
Steve Sanghi: So capacity utilization is moving higher. We have increased the wafer starts in our fab, and that's reflected in our guidance where I said the core Microchip or the classic Microchip without Supertex, gross margin midpoint is about 59.7%, which is substantially higher than the March. But we have a slight negative effect of the Supertex integration in the first quarter because their gross margin is lower and by the end of the year or so, we'll get them pretty good. But there's a short-term impact and our capacity utilization is increasing quite a bit in the back-end, all the way from wafer on, in probe and assembly and test. And we're adding substantial new equipment in all stages in fab probe, assembly, test, which is reflected in our $40 million of capital expense budget we have forecasted for the current June quarter.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: On the 32-bit market, the company continues to see steady share gains from a small base. Can you just update your thoughts on just the positioning within MIPS? And I know you also have an on license with the SMSC deal and just how you see that 32-bit market for you [ph] evolving?
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, we don't position our products to be MIPS or ARM or anything else. We position to be PIC32 microcontrollers. So we have our standard microcontroller portfolio of PIC32 products with well over 100 products in the portfolio. Its breadth of solutions available has been growing, contributing to a higher number of opportunities that we can serve. As we told you back in November, we have some of the highest-performance microcontrollers, some of the best code efficiency microcontrollers and a whole software platform that we have called MPLAB Harmony to enable that. And the success is coming from focusing on customers and applications rather than focusing on cores and architectures.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. Appreciate the color there. And Steve, if I could on the SMSC deal, it's been highly accretive. Any thoughts on just kind of what the biggest positive surprise is as you digested that deal have been, and then any other things that you're still working that you see as opportunity going forward?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we pretty much nailed it in that case. I mean, we highlighted significant accretion that we were going to get from various operating expenses, their operating expense was over 40% of sales compared to really what Microchip numbers have been. Their gross margin was a lot lower, and therefore combined together, their operating margin was about 12% in the full year before we bought them. And then now really in the Microchip range, so we've gotten improvement from gross margin, we've gotten improvement from operating expenses and we've gotten also improvement from taking some of their products that they were largely positioning them only in the vertical market, like USB was mainly in the computing market and Internet was mainly in the computing market. And with the Microchip broad customer base, we have been able to take them more broadly into set-top boxes and industrial and appliances and other stuff. So a lot of that has happened. There is still some more accretion to grow by the consolidation of assembly and test into Microchip facilities. I think we're only about half done.
Ganesh Moorthy: Half done.
Steve Sanghi: So only about half done and that basically slowed down because the environment recovered very strongly, and we got more busy really ramping the core Microchip stuff, microcontrollers and analog to our probe, assembly and test facilities, which was more important because it was incremental business. And now we have Supertex on our plate, so we're really trying to transfer some of the Supertex assembly and test also to our facilities. So there's a lot on the plate. There is plenty of opportunity to transfer the rest of SMSC, to transfer the Supertex and to keep growing our own business. That's a good thing. There's a lot of opportunity. But we haven't been able to fully complete it because the environment turned strong and we got busy growing our own business.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: If you could update us a little bit on the competitive dynamics in the microcontroller market. As you know, there are other companies' flash vendors that have kind of moved into the microcontroller market through acquisitions. Wondering kind of what your thought process overall of the competitive landscape in that market. And along those same lines, do you anticipate that there could be some consolidation in that market over time because it's fairly fragmented?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I'll make some comments and maybe Ganesh can add something to it. I think, the competitor you're mentioning is the one that brought a business from Japan. We are seeing 0 competition from this manufacturer. We never competed with their Japanese business before, and a lot of noise is being made. But there is really not in our customer base, really not seeing it. It's a memory company, it has been, and they bought some microcontroller and analog business, and they do well over time, but more likely, they're going to compete with some of the other Japanese companies like Renesas and Toshiba and others. But we're really not seeing any competition from them, so they have not changed the dynamics of either the microcontroller or the analog business even one iota.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: And do you -- could you kind of talk a little bit about the penetration of ARM in the microcontroller market? Do you see that accelerating at a faster rate? Or is it kind of in line with the kind of the previous thinking?
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh, do you want take that?
Ganesh Moorthy: We almost don't care. We're not focused on what the core is. We're focused on what our customer needs, what are applications we can focus on, how do we serve it with a PIC32 microcontroller, how do we provide the entire ecosystem to enable that customer to grow. So we're really not fixated on what the core should be and -- nor do we find the key customers we're working with fixated on that. Do we use an ARM core for some of our specialized microcontrollers? Of course. They came that way through the acquisitions we've made. We've left them there because that made sense, not because it was an ARM core, but because it was the most effective way that we can serve those customers. So our whole focus begins and ends with understanding customer needs and positioning and providing solutions that satisfy those needs, cost-effectively and competitively.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: And just last question on that 32-bit. If you look at kind of the market share data and maybe we need to update it, but I think you're kind of #5 or #6 in that range. And #1 is Renesas, NEC and then, I think #2 is Freescale. What is the intention or what are the plans to try to move up that market share scale?
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, you just saw what we did in the last fiscal year.
Steve Sanghi: Well, you named Renesas and NEC, they're really one.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes, I'm saying Renesas/NEC.
Steve Sanghi: So Renesas is 1 and Freescale is 2. In the Dataquest chart, I think we were #4, and we were $6 million away from #3. And we have come from way behind. So unless you're new to Microchip, I mean, if you look at over 10 years, the company that has gained the most share really would be us.
Ganesh Moorthy: And if you look at our microcontroller business, it grew 20% plus in the last fiscal year. Take a look at the entire list of microcontroller players and see if you can find anybody, anywhere close to that in the top of the list. And so we are gaining significant share, we have been every year and we move up relentlessly through the charts in each of 8, 16, 32 and in totality for all microcontrollers.
Steve Sanghi: Now this data just came out yesterday and I've had a chance to analyze it. I didn't dial it in my commentary because it was long, because we combined both quarterly results and the annual results, so I didn't speak about it. But our 32 business -- 32-bit microcontroller, 16-bit as well as 8-bit, they all 3 of them outgrew the industry growth. Our 32-bit microcontroller business blew away the growth of the industry. So -- I think we keep saying that in answer to question after question, though we don't really care about the core. Our customers don't buy the parts because of the core. They buy the parts because they're looking for a microcontroller solution. And in PIC32, it doesn't matter what core it is based on, provides them instead of performance and peripherals and software ecosystem, FAEs and system and support that they require to complete their parts and go to production.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: Steve, I just wanted to clarify some of the points you've made on the manufacturing side. It sounds like, as you've talked about the consolidation opportunities, off of the deals that you've done and with Supertex that it's really more on the back-end to -- with assembly and test to bring things in-house, but one, is that true? And is there more of an opportunity than what I thought I heard to consolidate more on the front-end as well and if so, what would that do to the percent of in-source versus out-sourced front-end work for you?
Steve Sanghi: I think, the back-end coming inside, comes a little easier. And they're easier qualifications and all that. They're bringing the front-end up from the required [ph], bringing process technologies. You may or may not have inside, depending on the lithography, it requires much larger capital investment and equipment. So in the case of SMSC, their products were on a much more leading-edge lithographies and we have not brought any of the SMSC in-house on the front-end. There are a few products we can and over time we might, but there we haven't. As far as Supertex is concerned, they were a much more of high-voltage company and their products were not on leading-edge lithographies. They've got a lot of 0.5 micron, 1 micron, 2 micron, even 3 micron products. So much more high-voltage oriented rather than push the lithography [ph]. And so many of the Supertex products are being evaluated for bringing to our fabs and many of them, they will come into our fab. But Supertex, from a revenue standpoint, was a smaller acquisition. I don't think it moves the needle that much inside versus outside. But yes, a lot of their products will. I mean, their inside today, they're in -- they're in their own fab. But it's a smaller 6-inch fab and we're evaluating bringing some of those products through a Microchip 8-inch fab.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: And then the follow-up question is more on the growth rate of the business, and I'll throw in a clarification with that. So given all the changes to the portfolio, both constructive organically, given the growth of the 32- and 16-bit businesses and the acquisitions that you've done, how do you think about the growth rate of your business now relative to the broader analog industry? And just a clarification on the revenue side, Eric, should we expect that the Supertex business really goes into the analog commentary that you typically provide quarterly or some of that and some of the other segments that you would comment on?
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes, so the Supertex acquisition will be reported as part of our analogs products group in the public reporting. Steve, I don't know if you want to address the other question, but he is asking about our growth versus industry growth and what's the projection could be? I mean, if you take out the Supertex acquisition, year-over-year results at the midpoint of our guidance is about 10.3% up, in the June quarter, which is absolutely in front of what the industry is doing. Craig, did you have a longer-term question?
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: Yes, it was a more of a longer-term question and the -- whether or not, the acquisitions that you've done have really altered the growth rate of the portfolio and enhanced the growth rate of the portfolio sustainably versus industry?
Steve Sanghi: Well, but you also, growing on a larger and larger base -- our business now, last year was $1.93 billion. The current quarter guidance puts out at -- puts us at, what, $2.0 billion -- or $2.1 billion, so you're growing on a much, much larger base. I'm really -- I can't really comment on the longer-term growth rate. I think this question has constantly been asked for a decade -- and without answering the question, you could look back and do any kind of analysis and we have beaten the growth rate of the industry over a short-term, long-term or over any horizon in market share gains organically, and in addition with the acquisitions. And we recently -- that's our goal to continue to do so.
Operator: And with no further questions in the queue, I'd now like to turn it back to today's speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Okay. Thank you, everybody, for joining the call. Some of you will see Eric Bjornholt at JPMorgan Conference in Boston. That's the next conference we go to. So thank you very much.
James Eric Bjornholt: Bye-bye.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Results Conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Microchip's President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt.
James Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2014 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Net sales in the December quarter were $482.4 million, and were down 2.1% sequentially from net sales of $492.7 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Revenue by product line was $313.3 million for microcontrollers, $108.9 million for analog, $32.5 million for memory, $24.1 million for licensing and $3.6 million of other. Revenue by geography was $90.7 million in the Americas, $95.4 million in Europe and $296.3 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of the contract manufacturing takes place. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 59% in the December quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27.1% of sales, non-GAAP operating income was 31.9% of sales and net income was $132.9 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.61 per diluted share, which was $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 58.6% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $1.8 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $165.8 million or 34.4% of sales, and include acquisition intangible amortization of $21.8 million, share-based compensation of $11.9 million and special charges of $0.8 million. The GAAP net income was $105.4 million or $0.48 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $6.2 million and a onetime gain of $2.4 million on our acquisition of EqcoLogic, for which GAAP accounting required us to write up our previous ownership of 18.3% to its fair value. Ganesh will discuss the EqcoLogic acquisition later on this call. In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11% and the GAAP tax rate was 6.4%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $6.2 million of nonrecurring favorable tax events I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect to various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5% to 11.5%. To summarize the after-tax impact the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the December quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.103, share-based compensation was about $0.056, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.028, the onetime gain on the EqcoLogic acquisition was about $0.011 and noncash interest expense was about $0.007. The dividend declared today of $0.355 per share will be paid on March 7, 2014 to shareholders of record on February 24 -- excuse me, February 21, 2014. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $70.7 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 46th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. And in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 48th occasion we have increased the dividend payment. And our cumulative dividend paid is approaching $2.2 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 31, 2014 was $274.6 million or 126 days. We expect days of inventory at the end of March to be down between 1 and 7 days based on our revenue guidance range. Inventory at our distributors stayed flat in the December quarter at 33 days and remain at low levels compared to where they have been historically. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. At December 31, the accounts receivable balance was $224.3 million, and decreased by $6.2 million on a sequential basis. Receivable balances remain in great condition, with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. Free cash flow generation in the December quarter was $110.3 million prior to our dividend payment. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $2.03 billion, and we had $650 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $135 million to $155 million in the March quarter. Capital spending was approximately $24.3 million for the December quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2014 to be about $115 million, as we are adding capital to support the growth of the business and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that were outsourced by SMSC. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $22.2 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers. Our overall microcontroller revenue declined 2.4% sequentially in the December quarter. However, microcontroller revenue was up 17.8% versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting a year of excellent market share gain in calendar 2013. Microcontrollers represented 65% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. As we projected, during our last quarter's conference call, we shipped a 13 billionth cumulative microcontroller in November, just 7 months after we shipped our 12 billionth microcontroller back in April. Our 16-bit microcontroller business was down 2.7% sequentially in the December quarter. However, 16-bit microcontroller revenue was up 27.9% over the year-ago quarter as we gained significant market share in calendar 2013. This business continues to be an important engine of ongoing growth for us, and we continue to find and serve new customers and new applications with our expanding portfolio. Our 32-bit microcontroller business was down 0.8% sequentially in the December quarter. However, 32-bit microcontroller revenue was up 29.5% over the year-ago quarter as, once again, we gain substantial market share in this segment. During the December quarter, we had 2 blockbuster announcements. First, the feature-rich, PIC32MZ family of products, which have the highest computational performance of any microcontroller in the category, as well as the best software efficiency. And second, the MPLAB Harmony integrated software platform, the industry's first software framework to integrate both internal and third-party middleware drivers, peripheral libraries and real-time operating systems. That's simplifying and accelerating the 32-bit software development process, which is one of the larger challenges customers face. Both these solutions have received broad industry accolades and customer acceptance. We are continuing to rapidly expand our new product portfolio, win new designs and expand into new fields of play like the Internet of Things to enable further growth in revenue and market share. Our overall microcontroller results, as well as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit results, are clearly outperforming the market, with year-over-year growth rates well above the market and what we've seen reported by our competitors in their results. We're gaining significant market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Now moving to our analog business. Our analog business bucked the trend and grew 0.4% sequentially in the December quarter, the ninth consecutive quarter of sequential growth to achieve a new record, and continues to perform exceptionally well. Analog revenue was also up 16.7% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting significant market share gains. Analog revenue represented 22.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. And we continue to have one of the best-performing analog franchises in the industry. In November, we announced the acquisition of EqcoLogic, a Brussels-based early stage company, who has innovative equalizer and coax transceiver products and technologies, which are important to our automotive and other embedded networking initiatives. EqcoLogic's leadership equalizer technology enables the effective recovery of high-speed signals that may degrade as they transmit over longer distances. In an automotive infotainment network, for example, this technology enables substantial system-level cost reduction as OEMs can switch from expensive optical fiber networks to much more cost-effective coaxial cable networks, even though the signals degrade more in a coax cable network as compared to an optical fiber network. Last but not least, in our core analog business, we are continuing to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. Now moving to our memory business. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was sequentially down 7.1%. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2014, then I will provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014. We are very pleased with our execution in the December quarter. All of the non-GAAP financial metrics like net sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share were at/or better than the midpoint of our guidance. Our operating profit percentage is approaching 32% and we are making excellent progress towards our long-term goal of 35% operating profit. Non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded the midpoint of the guidance by $0.01 per share. Our overall net sales in December quarter were up 16% versus the year-ago quarter, marking an excellent year of market share growth compared to a low single-digit growth for the industry. Our analog business made a new all-time record in December quarter, with sales up 0.4% sequentially and up 16.7% over the year-ago quarter. All other major segments of the business was sequentially down a bit based on the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. The end of December quarter also marks the completion of the 2013 calendar year, which was an excellent year for Microchip in every respect. Last but not the least, the December quarter was our 93rd consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in making this an outstanding year for Microchip. Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014. The March quarter is seasonally a middle-of-the-road quarter for Microchip, not as strong as June and September, but not sequentially down as December. It does not feel any different this year, and we expect this to be a seasonally normal quarter. Europe is normally very strong in this quarter, America is in the middle and Asia is down due to lunar new year holidays. Taking all of this into account, we expect the March quarter net sales to be flat to up 3% sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 59% and 59.2% of sales, which is a slight improvement from December quarter. We expect operating expenses to be between 26.8% and 27.2% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 31.8% and 32.4% of sales. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.59 and $0.63 per share. Our EPS is getting a slight negative impact by the addition of about 3 million shares through the share count. This is because of significantly higher average stock price in the current quarter versus the last quarter, the rising stock price mix of our $1.15 billion convertible transaction more in the money and results into a higher effective share count. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory writeup on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to press corp. With this, operator, will you please pull for questions? Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I was just wondering, in the automotive market, there's been talk of Ethernet coming into the automobile. Are you seeing that trend and are you preparing for that?
Ganesh Moorthy: So there are many standards that come into the automotive marketplace. In automotive networking for infotainment, the MOST network is the dominant standard today. There are, obviously, alternates in any given market. Ethernet is one of them. That is in consideration. But we believe we have a strong position in the marketplace and a position that customers have validated with their choice of our network.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And maybe just talk a little bit more about automotive. Are there many opportunities for 32-bit microcontrollers? And what's your traction there?
Ganesh Moorthy: So the answer is yes. There are many 32-bit applications in automotive. As you know, we have been on the journey for 32-bit for not as many years as some of the incumbents who play in that space. But we are starting to make inroads in 32-bit applications in carmakers just as we have previously with our 16-bit, as well as our 8-bit along the way. So we fully expect as time goes on, you'll see that our microcontrollers across the spectrum of 8s, 16s and 32s will play in many automotive applications.
Steve Sanghi: I'd like to add to that. When you come up with a brand new product line, whether it's 8, 16 and 32, if the first 2 products you make are for the automotive market, which means they have all the CAN bus, the LIN bus and all the protocols and everything that the automotive needs, then your first revenue is 3 or 4 years away. And that's not the best way to launch a brand new product line. So just like we did that with 8 or 16, we originally come up with a product line that will be quicker time-to-market in other applications, industrial, consumer and all the others. And then as the product line gains momentum and the architecture is accepted, we have round out all -- any other issues, any of the others, then you add the automotive features and start to work with automotive. So that began 3 years ago or so. And now we have designs in automotive and we're moving, but the large portion of the revenue is not automotive yet.
Operator: We'll move next to Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates.
Gilbert Alexandre: Could you remind me of what are your growth margin goals, long-term model?
Steve Sanghi: So our long-term model for those margin is 61.5%, plus/minus 0.5%. And we are certainly making progress. The middle point of the guidance for us in the current quarter is 59.1%. So we're reaching towards it and continue to make fairly good progress.
Operator: Moving on to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: You noted the strong growth in 16 and 32-bit year-over-year. Can you provide any color or context from new product introductions, what you're doing on those product lines and anything from a design win perspective?
James Eric Bjornholt: So in any given year, we have anywhere from 100 to 125 brand-new products that we bring to market. A substantial portion of that continues to be 16-bit and 32-bit because our portfolio there was not as rich as we did on the 8-bit. I don't have the exact numbers, but we're well over 100 products at this point on our 32-bit. And we're well above 400 products in our 16-bit portfolio.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. And as a follow-up, on the SMSC transaction, you guys saw a very strong margin expansion early on. Can you talk about just the revenue synergies and opportunities that you see over the next 12 to 18 months on that side?
Ganesh Moorthy: The revenue synergies are building over the last year. We have spent time in looking at how our customers' application boards where Microchip, prior to SMSC, did not play, but SMSC customers could use our products and how that could be brought to bear on new designs, and likewise where SMSC products could be brought into the Microchip customer base. So it is a -- these are long-design cycles. They take 18, 24 months to get to the point where they get to revenue. There are many the pipeline. Some of the early ones have gone to production. But we're very optimistic in terms of how the 2 product lines combined play a stronger role at many end customers than what each of us individually could have played.
Steve Sanghi: I mentioned this in the last conference call in November, I believe, that I spent a week with all of our Asian distributors, collected them all in 1 geography and nearly 80 or 90 of them and reviewed the last calendar year and had them -- put some plans together for the current calendar year. And it was quite surprising to see that Microchip's distribution, which was not SMSC distribution before, how much cross-selling opportunity they had identified on SMSC products into the Microchip customer base. There was, in fact, the highlight of the conference that just very, very significant opportunity they have identified in all of our consumer industrial accounts with USB and Ethernet and all of the other SMSC products. So they will take some time to go to production, but the opportunity is significant.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move back to Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Sorry about the difficulty before. Steve, I was just wondering if you could address again your new longer -- new higher longer-term margin model. It seems like the biggest place where you have to improve to get there is in the gross margin line. Can you talk about some of the utilization or cost structure measures in the cost of goods sold or mix and what the timeframe would be to kind of hope you to get to -- up to that 51.5% model?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I can lead you there qualitatively, but not really quantitatively breaking down the impact of each of the other things. So some of the qualitative factors are obviously fab utilization. Our internal fabs are not at the capacity they were yet at the peak for a number of reasons. As the couple of years go by, some of the technology migration happens and we're producing parts at a better nodes. So therefore, it just produces a large number of die in a wafer and therefore, cutting the number of wafers. Some of the products are made in outside foundries, where it was more either cost-effective or more feasible or we didn't have the technology inside. So for a number of reasons, we're not at that full capacity. So there's a significant accretion still coming as that goes towards a peak production. The acquisitions are not 100% integrated. We are far into it. But if you look at both from an assembly and test perspective and the wafer pro perspective, we're still moving a lot of the SMSC products into Microchip. And if we're to guess what portion of the test is converted?
Ganesh Moorthy: Probably about 20%, 25%.
Steve Sanghi: 25% of the test is converted. So it takes a while to get the momentum, but now we have the testers and load boards and programs. And it will rise very rapidly, but the first thing takes longer. So there's a lot of accretion coming from that also. And then there is a continuous margin improvement on our smaller product lines, which are newer in nature, where it takes a while for the products to ring out and build the next-generation products which are more cost effective and higher-yielding in our new technologies. So there are a number of things playing role in it and combination of all that gets there. I mean, we could get there on paper with a margin to give.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then as a follow-up, in terms of the environment in Asia, you talked about that being a little bit weaker in the quarter. Maybe that's just a seasonal thing, but clearly, there's been a lot of concern whether that's real or not real about China in the emerging markets. China PMI was down a little bit. Can you talk about just the overall order environment and what your customers are telling you out of Asia, and what you're seeing from Asian distributors in particular?
Steve Sanghi: Well, Asia goes through about 10 days of holidays and driven by that in the current quarter forecast. So Asia is down just about as much as it historically is just by the number of days they're off. So that's why we called the quarter pretty seasonally normal. Booking patterns are normal. There's really nothing abnormal to call. There's not any kind of crisis or disaster in the works. Our products are also very ubiquitous, though. They go into areas where as Chinese are building more and more consumerism, a lot of them, they acquire these products where our products are in. We're in the things and people buy a things.
Operator: We'll now hear from Susquehanna Financial Group's Chris Caso.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Just a question about production levels. And I think last quarter you suggested the plan was to keep production fairly constant as you went through this quarter, and your comments suggested that the inventory levels internally come down as a result of that. If you hit those inventory targets by the end of this quarter, should we expect the production levels to start increasing as we go into the June quarter? And if you could give some sense of the effect of that on gross margins.
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think it depends on where we are within the guidance, which is really narrow, flat to up 3%. We have not put together a plan. And we're in the middle of our annual operating planning process. Our fiscal year ends at the end of the current quarter. So we don't really have an official fiscal 2015 plan yet to really see what production we'll be running. But if we grow production, that will improve gross margin. The inventory is not exactly where I want it to be. I think it needs more improvement. We'll get some this quarter whether we need some more next quarter or we could completely improve production. We don't know yet. It depends on where it will land. Do you have something to add?
James Eric Bjornholt: No. I was going to say there's ongoing gross margin improvement from the back end from assembly and test as we bring more of that in-house as well.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: So you may get some gross margin improvement from the back end, but the front end is obviously dependent on the revenue levels and where the inventory goes?
James Eric Bjornholt: That's right.
Steve Sanghi: We expect improvement in June quarter in gross margin, right? No question about it. Well, June quarter is generally a strong quarter for us. And there'll be higher absorption. And there should be a gross margin improvement in June quarter, no question.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And just looking out, as you say, you're in the planning process for fiscal '15. What do you expect your strategic priorities to be as you look into fiscal '15? And assuming the demand environment kind of stays stable as it is now, SMSC, the integration seems to be, I would guess, I'd characterize late innings now. Not sure how you would characterize it, but where does the management focus turn to as you go into fiscal '15?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we're not a one-trick pony. I mean, at the current quarter guidance, we're almost a $2 billion company, just slightly shy of that, around 12, 13 divisions inside the company. So continue to building out 32-bit and 16-bit and analog. And there's still a lot of new products in 8-bit. We'll continue to gain a lot of share in 8-bit as other people either can't compete or don't want it or whatever. So all the strategic product lines have a very strong roadmap, and they're all showing significant growth in the initial analysis. Then if you look at from an end market or application perspective, we're getting a very significant acceptance in growth in the Internet of Things, motor control, digital power, lighting, medical, touch, automotive. So there are just way too many. I mean, we're really -- we show a chart in the presentations. There are about 14 different segments that we have significant focus in. Now the other thing that we've been telling you for years, Microchip has one company, recognize this before many of the others in the industry that semiconductor industries has matured and saturating. And if you look at the overall semiconductor growth, they are in low single-digits year after year. We have done well. Our December quarter was up 15% year-over-year, 16%, but we also understand that there is a significant industry growth headwind that every company faces. And therefore, we also are trying to supplement Microchip's growth by a constant stream of small and some large acquisitions to bring in overall growth to a reasonable number where it will be acceptable to Microchip management and its board. So it's a combination of internal and external growth. It's not only one or the other. And we're not doing acquisitions to mask any risk of our internal growth. We're doing it to enhance on the top of the internal growth that you've seen us now for several years.
Operator: We'll now go to JoAnne Feeney with ABR Investment Strategy.
JoAnne Feeney: I have a follow-up question on the issue of the guidance for the current quarter. I'm wondering, this is the first round of a March guidance we've seen since the acquisition was fully integrated. And I'm wondering if what we're picking up here is perhaps that little bit of a shift in your seasonal pattern given the different end markets that are now weighing in. And as you said, China, you're seeing probably some of your stuff go into more consumer-oriented products. So some of the last 10 years, the data and throughout the 2 that were real outliers, you typically saw around 3% to 3.5% growth in the March quarter. So can you -- do you have a sense of this whether you're seeing basically a little bit of a shift in your seasonal pattern because of the different end market mix than before the acquisition?
Steve Sanghi: Well, JoAnne, you are always very astute and smart in your analysis. And I think you have answered your question. There are 2 shifts in that seasonality, minor ones, but they're definitely worth noting. One is that with the acquisitions and all that, we have little more of our business now in the computing segment, which kind of sees a significant decline in the calendar first quarter than we had in the Microchip's core business. So there's a little impact of that. The second impact is Asia is becoming a larger and larger portion of our business. I mean, China is a huge portion of our business now. We break those out in the Qs. You can read them. So as that becomes larger and larger portion of the business, then you have a larger portion of overall Microchip that takes a drop in the calendar first quarter because of the Chinese New Year. And if there's enough shift in the business in Asia and that starts to be material. So I think those combined two things together, this is probably the new normal, but it probably also mean that you'll pick up that gap on other quarters which are either stronger quarters for Asia or they're stronger quarters for SMSC business. So overall, it hasn't shifted, but there's a slight impact in the calendar first quarter because of those 2 reasons.
JoAnne Feeney: All right, okay, perfect. And then as a follow up, just looking longer term at your opportunities for continued share gain, it's been quite impressive in 16-bit and 32-bit. But one might expect that, that would naturally slow down as you kind of tick off the low-hanging fruit. So I guess, could you give us some sense of what you expect over the next year or so and how you expect, if you do, to continue to gain share and what you think the pace of that will be, that is the growth of those 2 segments relative to the industry?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the current estimates aren't saying that it kind of slows down. If it does, that's really minor in nature. But then you pick up the difference by newer applications where we can now do a very good job where maybe historically, we could not with the high-performance 16 and 32-bit product lines like digital power, like the lighting, like the Internet of Things, Wi-Fi connectivity and all that kind of stuff. So we are opening additional, large amount of served available market. I mean, if you look at the Internet of Things, our revenue in Internet of Things is hundreds of millions of dollars. If you look at the overall definition of what some of the others are calling as overall Internet connectivity or machine-to-machine connectivity, and it's the fastest-growing segment of the business. So there are always pluses and minuses and something saturates, but then the new opportunities emerge, and how well positioned you are. You want to talk about IoT a little bit?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. I think as Steve mentioned, this is one of the exciting areas of opportunity presented to us. And the broad adoption of tablets and smartphones are one of the catalysts that are accelerating the demand for more things to be connected and accessible by these mobile devices. And we've historically had a very strong presence in a broad range of things that are in our home and in some of our other areas where we interact. And we think we have a pole position on -- as these things get connected, our solutions being in the center of how they are connected. Therefore, things that we know, 4 areas that we have to bring to bear to win in the Internet of Things market. One is a strong portfolio of microcontrollers and analog, which we have and we're continuing to strengthen. Two is a strong portfolio of wireless and wired connectivity. Three is a suite of the software and firmware requirement for the different protocol and security that is going to be required any time you have connectivity. And finally, the fourth is a set of partners who can provide both cost-effective and scalable cloud infrastructure because most of them are really not IT experts, nor have any IT infrastructure. And when you put it all together, it's epicenter of where we have played. We have customers that we know very well, and we have technologies to enable them. And we are seeing many, many of them taking advantage of that capability.
JoAnne Feeney: So it sounds like you're looking at some adjacent sockets in products where you're already appearing, in dishwashers and other white goods, for example?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. So we are in things and now we are helping customers connect those things. So selling additional content, whether it's a wireless module or an RF module are really getting them, helping them do more things. And then continuing with the answer to your question, we talked about all the cross-selling opportunities with SMSC products into our socket. So think about how many cars today have a USB charger socket in the car. Every time I do an analysis, if there are 10 people I'm talking to, and I ask a question, the number comes out to be about 20% and 30%. In 20%, 30% of the cars, people have a USB charger. You can always charge for the cigarette lighter, but I'm talking about the actual USB charger. And now fast forward 3 or 4 years, don't you think all -- 100% of the cars will have a USB charger because that's what's becoming the life. And who is getting in all these cars, whose USB chargers are in most of the cars? It's yours truly. So there are always areas which are growing significantly faster where there's a significant opportunity. When you look at the USB -- so we have proprietary technology where you plug in a smartphone into the USB charger of the car and a phone can become the host. And whatever you have on the phone, it will display that whether it's navigation or whatever on the screen of the car, which could be extremely beneficial. Everybody uses navigation on their phone as they travel or get rental cars, everybody uses the phone. I know how to use it in my phone. I don't even know how to use it in my car. Next time, I'm going to get one in the car because I have it in the phone. And you plug it to the USB charger, and it displays what you're running on your phone on your car. So -- and we were showing that at the CES show in Las Vegas, an actual demo of that working. So there are tremendous opportunities coming up with this connectivity. And we're right in the thicket of it. And there are lots of design wins, there are lots of opportunities. So those things will grow faster. And some of the mature businesses could slow down a little bit, but the overall opportunity has not decreased.
Operator: We'll go now to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: A question for Ganesh. Ganesh, congratulations. Steve and Ganesh, congratulations on pretty impressive microcontroller growth as a category. I was wondering if you could provide some color on maybe between 8, 16 and 32, which one you think you took the most share in? If you want to rank, order them or just talk qualitatively, I would appreciate the color.
Steve Sanghi: I think if you want to look at the dollars, we took the most share in 8-bit, didn't we?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes, in overall dollars because that's the rank order of the revenue is 8-bit, the largest business, followed by 16, followed by 32. But if you look at the growth rates, you're going to find that compared to where the baseline grew, 16 and 32-bit is where we grew, outgrew, and 8-bit will have outgrown, but by not quite the same magnitude. So it's hard -- we'll know in 2 or 3 months when all the official numbers will be put together. But I'm expecting we'll see large gains across 8, 16 and 32.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair enough, guys. That's helpful. And I wanted to ask you, in your press release, Steve you talked about the MPLAB Harmony integrated software platform. I was struggling to understand how that will work in terms of you being able to sell chips. Maybe you could take up a couple of minutes to explain how that flows through in your P&L?
Steve Sanghi: Well, so the most difficult thing for the customer in a 32-bit is development of the software and the firmware. And if you have a piecemeal solution where the chip comes from one party, the stack comes from another party, the library comes from another party, the development will come from somebody else, and then you have to put all those things together, then you don't have a very good experience because when something isn't working, you don't know whether it's architecture or the chip, or the software or the development tool or whatever. So what Microchip has done is the entire PIC32 solution comes from Microchip, but it's much more like an Apple kind of experience where the product, the architecture, the software, the development tool, the libraries, the stacks, everything is coming from Microchip and already crosschecked and functional. So what we have done on the top of that now with the Harmony software is really integrated the entire ecosystem. We also integrated the third-party software, the middleware, the stacks and everything all pre-checked out. And customers are telling us, it's up to 40%, 50% productivity. And this development of the software is about 75% of the total cost in adopting a 32-bit microcontroller into an end application. And on that 75% of the cost, if you can provide that much productivity on an industry, accolades are coming like crazy. So how we essentially monetize this, winning more designs, accelerating time-to-market, selling more 32-bit chips. And then in all the software and all that, you always have a version of it which is free essentially. Anybody can use it. So there's a wide acceptance of it. But then you have premium versions and you have software support and upgrades and all that for which you charge, it becomes a product. But that's not where the big money is. Big money is really still selling that chip.
Operator: And next from Crédit Suisse, we'll hear from John Pitzer.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I apologize, I've been jumping back and forth across a couple of calls, Steve. So if you addressed this, I do apologize. But it's been my perception that the environment over the last couple of quarters has sort of given you guys perhaps a little bit more visibility than sort of normal. And I'm kind of curious, notwithstanding kind of the seasonal issues in the March quarter, as you think about lead times and just the rate at which customers are placing orders, how would you kind of characterize visibility today? And I guess as you answer the question, Steve, you've always had a better view than most on the economy and the macro. And I'm kind of curious, as you think about 2014, is the macro a tailwind, a headwind or a neutral factor as we think about your growth?
Steve Sanghi: The best guess would be neutral.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then just relative to visibility today versus, let's say, 30 days ago, how are you guys seeing kind of customer activity in order? Is it just tracking around normal seasonality, and so we really have to wait until after Chinese New Year to have a better assessment?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, it hasn't changed. Basically, there's a lot of positioning and jockeying for position for the Chinese New Year. And even for December, some people have year-end in December. They're trying to lower the inventories. Some distributors have a fiscal year ending at some other times. So they kind of adjust the inventory a different time. Some people want the product before the Chinese New Year, so they can participate in the surge afterwards. And some place the order, but they want to take their delivery after. So there are all these crosscurrents, and it's kind of -- I think the good thing is Chinese New Year is early. I mean, it's beginning now. And 2 months of the quarter are left after that. And usually, every time that happens, where the Chinese New Year is early, usually has been a positive result.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And Steve, as my follow-up, at our conference in December, you gave a pretty informative presentation about the positioning of 32-bit and kind of what you're doing at the software level on the ecosystem. And correct me if I'm wrong, but the argument sort of was you're kind of hitting an inflection point or a critical mass point where 32 might actually start to show even more meaningful gains in the strong growth you're seeing. Is that how I should think about the 32 big growth prospects for 2014? And I also noticed in the quarter you announced an ARM-based microcontroller. Should I just think about that as another arrow in your quiver or is there something more strategic behind that?
Steve Sanghi: So several questions in there. Number one, yes, the point I made on 32-bit is we went over 100 products last quarter. And 100 products is kind of the magical critical mass. If you have fewer products in a microcontroller, then you have engagement issues with our customer, where the customer engages, he does all this work and says, "I like the architecture. I'll use your product." But then they need more memory or the connectivity, they need a LIN bus, they need a Wi-Fi, they need an RF on the chip, and you don't have that version of the product, then their work is wasted and they have to go through the different architectures. So customers often look for having a sufficient critical mass of products where there's a very high probability that the product they need is in the portfolio, and at 100-plus products that becomes really real. So we really, we hit that number. So we think that's a reasonable inflection point. And the second is the 2 main things that I talked about at your conference, and Ganesh talked about it today. One is the announcement of the 32-bit and 32 MZ product line, which is really industry's the highest performance microcontroller in its class. And second is this Harmony software development tool, which is absolutely a productivity giver to the customers. So we think all those things combined is really a game-changer. And we're starting to see it in the feedback we're getting.
Operator: We'll hear now from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: I wanted to follow up on a different product segment, the analog product group. The business has performed very well in the last year. And how should we think about the way you're looking at growing that business as we think about calendar '14 and beyond, whether it be from a product group standpoint. Where do you feel like you can add products or whether it be just from taking that product to market, whether it be channel management strategies, what have you?
Steve Sanghi: Well, so we have described over the years where we had a three-pronged strategy in analog. Early on at the start of the century, our analog strategy was largely attaching analog to our own microcontrollers for the first few years because we had no name recognition in analog, we didn't know Microchip makes analog. So we had a great name recognition in microcontrollers, so we will position and attach RPMs and supervisors and power management and those kind of products together with our microcontroller sockets. And at one point at the peak, well over 70% of our analog business was attached to our microcontroller. But that strategy was quite successful. Then we went into the Phase 2 where we said, "Well, our analog products are so well designed and architected to work in a microcontroller-embedded control environment. Why would we limit ourself to only Microchip's microcontrollers." Back then, we had 4%, 5% market share in microcontroller overall because we didn't even make 16 and 32 at that time. 8-bit, why we would not position this to any microcontroller, whether it's Freescale or NXP or Atmel or ST or anybody else? We don't win the microcontroller, but we still compete for the analog because our architecture is very well to work next to those designs. So that was the Phase 2 of that strategy, and they were very successful a few years ago. It accelerated our growth rate on analog. And then, in the last few years, we said, Phase 3. Why would we now limited only to the microcontroller sockets? What about FPGA? What about DSP? What about SoCs, silicon on chip? Or really any kind of sockets. And that put us in a direct competition with TI, ADI, Linear, Maxim, some of the big companies. And we have, what, over 2,000 products in analog now?
Ganesh Moorthy: About 1,100 to 1,200.
Steve Sanghi: 1,100, 1,200 analog products. So broad portfolio and positioning it really head-on with in any kind of sockets. And it has worked very well. And we're growing. We have the best performance of analog in the industry compared to -- look at the year-over-year growth rates compared to anybody.
Ganesh Moorthy: And it's not just the last year, right? If you go back and look at it, it's now been for several years we've seen that analog has performed exceptionally well and outgrown the analog industry and the semiconductor industry both.
Steve Sanghi: And people have some sort of this mix that analog is black magic, and all the analog engineers work for these other companies and you can't find them and that's just kind of not true. We were able to attract them. We had lots of analog engineers working in our microcontroller groups because 95% of the microcontroller revenue is with the large amount of analog on the same die. And we were able to package some of that functionality standalone, some of it together with the microcontroller. But really, we were able to amass a fair amount of these sources, some through acquisitions, some ourselves, and then created one of the best-performing analog franchises in the industry.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: Well, I was going to summarize it by saying it seems like what you're saying is the recipe for growth is to continue to execute on the strategy that you have in place. As I look back at some of your past comments, I think it was 2 quarters ago, maybe it was even 3, where you said based on the successful completion of the SMSC deal, you were ready to do another mid-sized deal. Subsequent to that, there hasn't been such a deal. Is the issue that there aren't good targets out there, is the issue that there are good targets, but that with the market going so much higher that the valuations aren't where you'd be comfortable, where do you stand with respect to growing through acquisition at this point?
Steve Sanghi: So like I said early on, I don't know whether you were on the call yet or not, but I mentioned in fiscal 2015 and then going forward, we continue to have a strategy of significant internal growth and then further beefed up by continuous small or occasionally large acquisition. Beyond that, I couldn't really give you any signal for timing or what area or whatever. But it's like we're active constantly.
Operator: And we'll take a follow-up from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to see if you could give a few comments around the licensing business? Do you have more contracts on the way? And how does licensing play into the Internet of Things?
Steve Sanghi: So the only way licensing plays in the Internet of Things is really enabling our SuperFlash technology to build low-power microcontrollers in the industry, which will then go to the Internet of Things. Otherwise, it doesn't really have a direct play. What we have successfully done is really essentially licensed to every major foundry is licensed on a SuperFlash technology. The largest big foundries, any other foundry you name, the one in Taiwan, the one in China, the ones in Singapore, the ones in Malaysia, the ones in Europe, they all have license of SuperFlash technology. And some are in production and some are proceeding towards the production where the licensing happened either last year or the year before. And these are very complex technologies. It takes a couple of years to go to production. So there's a significant additional revenue growth ahead as these additional foundries go to production and the royalty income begin. We have more than doubled the business since we bought SST. When we bought it, it was doing $40 million a year business. We're doing about $90 million now. And there's further growth ahead as many more of these foundries go to production.
Operator: And gentlemen, at this time, we'll turn the conference back to you all for closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Well, thanks for attending the conference. Our next conference we go to is...
James Eric Bjornholt: We're presenting at Stifel Conference on February 11.
Steve Sanghi: Okay. So we'll see some of you there. Otherwise, we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: And that will conclude today's conference. Again, we thank you all for joining us.
Steve Sanghi: Bye-bye.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Results [Technical Difficulty]
James Eric Bjornholt: Which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Net sales in the September quarter were a record $492.7 million, and were up 6.5% sequentially from net sales of $462.8 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Revenue by product line was $321 million for microcontrollers, $108.5 million for analog, $35 million for memory, $24.8 million for licensing and $3.4 million of other. Revenue by geography was $95.2 million in the Americas, $98.9 million in Europe and $298.6 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of the contract manufacturing takes place. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 59% in the September quarter and above the high end of our guidance of 58.7%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27.2% of sales. Non-GAAP operating income was 31.8% of sales. And net income was a record $136.4 million. This resulted in record earnings of $0.63 per diluted share, which was $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 58.6% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins included the impact of $1.9 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $171.4 million or 34.8% of sales and include acquisition, intangible amortization of $23.7 million and also include share-based compensation of $13.1 million. The GAAP net income of $99.8 million or $0.46 per diluted share was a result in the quarter. In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10.6% and the GAAP tax rate was 10.3%. The GAAP tax rate in the September quarter was favorably impacted by $2 million of nonrecurring items. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effects of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any onetime events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5% to an 11.5%. To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share on the September quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.11, share-based compensation was about $0.062, nonrecurring tax events were about $0.009 and noncash interest expense was about $0.006. Share-based compensation was higher in the September quarter and will also be at a higher level than normal on the December quarter due to the vesting of performance-based awards to employees that had been on a voluntary pay reduction program from late Q3 fiscal 2013 through Q1 fiscal 2014. This performance award vests on November 15, 2013 due to Microchip's achievements of record non-GAAP earnings per share on the September quarter. We believe this pay sacrifice allowed us to remain committed to our strategic programs by avoiding a layoff and helped us deliver the outstanding results you are seeing now. Share-based compensation is expected to impact earnings by about $0.058 in the December quarter and then reduced to about $0.051 in the March quarter. The dividend declared today of $0.3545 per share will be paid on December 5, 2013 to shareholders of record on November 21, 2013. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $70.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 45th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. And in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 39th occasion we have increased the dividend payment. And our cumulative dividends paid is almost $2.1 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 30, 2013, was $275.1 million or 123 days. We expect days of inventory at the end of the December quarter to be flat to up about 8 days based on our revenue guidance range. Inventory at our distributors increased by 1 day during the September quarter to 33 days and remain at low levels compared to where they have been historically. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. At September 30, the consolidated accounts receivable balance decreased slightly on a sequential basis to $230.5 million. Receivables remain in great condition, with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. We had strong free cash flow generation in the September quarter of $126.4 million prior to our dividend payment. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $1.98 billion. And we had $640 million in borrowings under revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $110 million to $130 million in the December quarter. Capital spending was approximately $27.4 million for the September quarter. We expect about $35 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for the fiscal year 2014 to be about $115 million, as we are adding capital to support the growth of the business and to bring in-house some of the assembly and test operations that were outsourced by SMSC. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $23 million. One question we have received from investors is whether we are concerned about the level of the short interest in our stock. In summary, we are not. And we wanted to pass along our assessment of the situation. As you know, Microchip has had a convertible bond outstanding since December 2007. The bonds are convertible into 43.4 million shares, which is about 22% of our outstanding common shares. According to public sources, the aggregate short interest position in our shares jumped from approximately 5 million shares to approximately 25 million shares when we issued the convertible. And that number is roughly 20 million shares today. This level was neither surprising nor troubling to us because the significant portion of the convertible bond market consistent of arbitrage funds. The general strategy of these funds is the whole convertible debt would create an economic-long stock exposure, and then hedge this exposure with a short position in the common shares. It is worth noting that this hedging objective is very different from the strategy of activist or directional short-sellers. In any event, the size of the short position arising from a convertible will correspond to the level of equity exposure in the bonds and the percentage of the bonds being held by arbitrage funds. We know that a sizable amount of our convertible is held by arbitrage funds. And we believe that their activity represents the majority of the overall short interest, which has generally remained in the 15 million to 25 million shares range since 2007. Other companies that have similar convertible bonds outstanding also have high levels of short interest in their stocks. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. The September quarter was one for the ages with strong growth in each of our product lines and new records in most of them. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product line starting with microcontrollers. Our overall microcontroller revenue grew a strong 6.9% sequentially in the September quarter to achieve an all-time record of $321 million in revenue. Microcontroller revenue was also up 22.9% versus the year-ago quarter. As we projected in our July conference call, our 8-bit microcontrollers did set a new record in the September quarter, as did our 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses. Microcontrollers represented 65.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. Sometime in the month of November, we expect to ship our 13th billion cumulative microcontroller, a milestone that will occur just 7 months after we ship our 12th billion microcontroller back in April of this year. Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 10.9% sequentially in the September quarter, achieving a new record for revenue. 16-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 48.1% over the year-ago quarter. We continue to expand the breadth of innovative 16-bit solutions that we're offering, the number of customers that we are serving and new applications that we're winning as we continue to gain market share in this segment. Our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 24% sequentially in the September quarter, registering another strong quarter of growth to also set a new record for revenue. 32-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 53.4% over the year-ago quarter. We are continuing to expand our new product portfolio. And next month, we plan to announce a number of blockbuster solutions that will further enrich our 32-bit microcontroller platform offering. In the meanwhile, we are continuing to win new designs. And we're expanding into new applications to enable further growth in revenue and market share. Our overall microcontroller results, as well as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit results are clearly outperforming the market. The sequential and year-over-year growth rate's well above the market and what we have seen reported by our competitors in their results. We're gaining significant market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Now moving to our analog business. This business grew 5.1% sequentially in the September quarter, the 8th consecutive quarter of sequential growth to also achieve a new record. And it continues to perform exceptionally well. Analog revenue was also up 25.2% from the year-ago quarter. Analog revenue now represents 22% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. And at close to $434 million annual sales run rate, it remains one of the best-performing analog franchises in the industry. We are continuing to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. Moving to our memory business. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products was up 2.9%. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 7.1% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2014, then I will provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2014. I will also provide guidance for our long-term model, which we are revising upwards. We are very pleased with our execution in the September quarter. Our actual net sale exceeded the high end of our guidance. The 59% gross margin we achieved was 100 basis points better than June quarter and exceeded the high end of our guidance, as we increased factory output to meet the increased sales results. Our operating profit percentage reached 31.8%. And we are making excellent progress towards what our long-term goal of 32% operating profit was, which we will derive higher later in this call. Non-GAAP earnings per share also exceeded the high end of our guidance and beat our guidance by $0.03 per share. We made several new all-time records in the quarter. Our total net sales, microcontroller net sales, analog net sales and our licensing business all achieved new records. Individually, 8-bit microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers and 32-bit microcontrollers all achieved new all-time records. Our record 8-bit microcontroller revenue further validates what we have been communicating to investors and analysts, which is that our 8-bit MCU business is very healthy, growing and very profitable. Our 8-bit MCU business is continuing to gain share from competitors could have either moved away from 8-bit or are otherwise uncompetitive and cannot make money in the 8-bit market. We're also continuing to gain market share in the 16-bit MCU, 32-bit MCU and analog. We mentioned on our last conference call that Microchip has an outsized exposure to housing, industrial and automotive sectors. These has been some of the strong sectors of the economy this year. While we do not break out our business by these sectors, just looking at some sample customers, we saw significant strength in customers that sell products for housing, industrial and automotive. Last but not the least, the September quarter was our 92nd consecutive profitable quarter, which is 23 years of making profit every quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in making this an outstanding quarter in every respect. I also wanted to compare our results of September quarter versus the year-ago September quarter. September quarter of this year was up 20.8% over the September quarter last year. Last year, September quarter had 2 months of SMSC net. If we add the third month of SMSC and then compare the September quarter of this year was up 11.5% over September quarter last year. This was the best performance among our peers and competitors, and many of whom were flat-to-down in September quarter over the year-ago September. Our outstanding results were also recognized by Selling Power magazine who recently named Microchip to its annual 50 Best Companies to Sell For, for 2013. Microchip ranked 19th, and is the only semiconductor company on that list. Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2014. The December quarter is our seasonally weakest quarter of the year. The December quarter in 2010 and 2011 averaged a sequential decline of 3.5%. Last year was impacted positively by an additional month of revenue from the SMSC acquisition. We're expecting the December quarter this year to be seasonally normal and are guiding for net sales to be flat to down 6% sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.8% and 59.2% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 27% and 27.5% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 31.3% and 32.2% of sales. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.57 and $0.63 per share. As I said earlier in the call, we are revising our long-term model upwards. You may recall that after the acquisition of SMSC, we revised our long-term model downwards. This was driven by the lower gross margin, higher operating expenses and lower operating profit of the SMSC business. We are revising the business model upwards due to 3 reasons. Number one, our microcontroller and analog business has outperformed very well. With improving factor utilization, our margins on microcontrollers and analog have recovered very nicely. We believe that we have further upside as the factory utilization continues to approach the old record and eventually exceed it. Number two, while we have countered on significant improvement in the SMSC operating model, we have substantially exceeded our own internal goals. SMSC operating model is now approaching the traditional Microchip model. The longer-term synergy actions are also now starting to bear fruit. As one example, I just returned from our Asia-wide distribution conference. The opportunities that our sales and distribution network have identified on SMSC products is truly impressive. As these opportunities move down the sales process and get to the order stage, we will see a substantial growth and a profitability model will continue to improve. And number three, our licensing business just achieved an all-time record and is at nearly $100 million run rate. At 100% gross margin, its net effect on gross and operating margin is very accretive. Based on these 3 factors, we are revising our long-term model for Microchip upwards. We are revising the midpoint of gross margin to be 150 basis points higher. We're revising the midpoint of operating expenses to be 100 basis points lower. And we are revising the midpoint of the operating profit to be 250 basis points higher. We now expect the long-term gross margin to be 61.5% plus or minus 0.5%. We now expect long-term operating expenses of about 26.5%, plus or minus 0.5%. And we now expect operating profit of about 35%, plus or minus 1%. All of these numbers are non-GAAP. This takes our long-term operating model back to what it was prior to the SMSC acquisition. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters. And we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to press corp. With this, operator, will you please pull for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Chris Caso of Susquehanna.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Just taking into the consideration the revised margin targets, what should we expect with respect to the gross margins, operating margins as we go through this cycle? I think that during the last cycle, your gross margins bottomed to 56%. Would you also assume that we -- obviously, we don't know where revenue will trough during the next downturn, but would you expect to see higher troughs for the same reasons that you had mentioned?
Steve Sanghi: Well, it seems like the gist of your question implies the revenue and continues to gross down here and trough somewhere. Our expectation is that December quarter is seasonally very normal. And as you have seen in the past, December quarter is seasonally down, and then the March is seasonally up. We usually grow low single-digits in the March quarter. And our current expectation is that, that will not be really any different.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Sure. The nature of my question wasn't really near-term. Obviously, it's a cyclical business. So just as you go through the length of a cycle, really, that was what I was getting at.
Steve Sanghi: Yes. So I'm not seeing a recession in front of us. The recessions come in various forms. There are unit recessions, the demand recessions, inventory revenue recessions, financial crisis. And everything is different depending on what we do with our fabs, what we do with our assembly and test, what actions we take. So it's very, very difficult to guide on something we don't see today on really what our actions would be in response to that recession.
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes. Maybe just what I would add to that is now that a larger portion of our business is relying on foundry, that has less of the ups and downs in the gross margin area that is not impacted by our own factory utilization. But like Steve said, each cycle is different.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. Just a quick follow-up. With regard to the plans to build inventory, could you talk a little bit about the reasons behind that? And I guess perhaps that has some connection to where your lead times are now?
Steve Sanghi: So I'll give you a general opinion on inventory. We don't manage the inventory. We don't manage our factories in a way that we constantly take them up or down to try to manage into a very tight range of inventory. You can go back into our history, we have never done that. The companies who do that are either constantly laying off people and cutting production and then hiring untrained people and definitely trying to grow and making mistakes when the times grow stronger. Our desire to the cycle usually is to run our factories in a much more constant fashion and allows the inventory to fluctuate up or down. Now the very long life cycle of Microchip products, microcontroller, analog and memory products historically has always allowed us to manage it in that fashion, in not taking any large inventory write-offs. You could go back in history, there's no record of Microchip coming into you and saying, we rolled off $100 million of inventory, like some other competitors may have done. So we run the factories much more normally. And we allow the inventory to fluctuate. And as Eric mentioned, in more recent past, we now have 40% of our business coming out of foundries because of significant large acquisitions and others which allows you to really control inventory rapidly by turning the stacks on the outside factories. So when you put it all together, until just 1.5 months ago, we were expediting products and trying to improve production and adding capacity because we -- the midpoint of our guidance for September quarter was 4%. We produced 6.5%. If you manage too tightly on the inventory, you cannot produce that kind of upside in a very short timeframe. And now the December quarter is seasonally down, we expect March quarter to be up. In that kind of environment, we don't really take any actions. So the inventory driven by lower revenue will be higher in December. And we'll decrease some in March. And we'll take those actions over the next 2 or 3 quarters, allow the revenue increase to naturally adjust inventory. Now having said all that, there have been a couple of times in our history, one was after the financial crisis of 2009, and may have been a tech buster. Some of these mega events in the industry will cause the situation where you have to take precipitously some strong actions, otherwise the inventory would go way too high. Other than that, it would be a small one quarter perturbation. We run our business more constantly and not go up and down. Sorry for the long answer.
Operator: And we will go next to Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Steve, I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the overall bookings environment? This time last quarter, you talked about very strong bookings environment. And later in the quarter, you guided to the near to midpoint of the range. And then you ended doing much better than that. So I'm just kind of curious, have the bookings pace moderated at all at this point or do you still expect a fairly strong book to bill and then the December guidance is more of just a little bit more tempered by the normal seasonality?
Steve Sanghi: Well, bookings are still good if I look at the overall long-term backlog. And the bookings that are coming in are still good. But bookings, the large amount of bookings are aging into the next quarter. Some are aging into this quarter, but based on at the rate they're aging and the amount of 9 weeks or so left in the quarter, an introduction to the guidance that we provided. But the overall rate of the bookings are still strong because lots of bookings are coming into the next quarter, which is seasonally stronger quarter for us also.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Understand, that's helpful. And then, I guess, if you think about the upward vision to your gross margin target, how much do you think is being driven by the licensing business versus the mix of products you're expecting to have versus utilization? Any way to put some kind of rough sense on that?
Steve Sanghi: They were really in bad order. The best performance we're getting is really out of our own microcontroller and analog businesses. There was a concern from the street on our 32-bit business. There was a concern on our 8-bit business. There was concern on our 16-bit business. They will get squeezed by 8 and 32. There was the concern on our 8-bit business because everybody else is going away from it. And there was a concern on our 32-bit business because we're not ARM. The 19 covered many years now, we have demonstrated there are 8, 16, 32-bit. All those 3 businesses are -- they're a tremendous win. And they're all growing. And they're all making records. And they're all high margins and so on and so forth. So temporarily, during last year, our gross margin went down because essentially, factory utilization. And it affected significantly our internal businesses, the ones we run inside our fabs because those were the ones mainly impacted by lower utilization. As that utilization has continued to improve, and especially by beating these numbers, last 3 quarters, we have written our revenue guidance. The utilization is getting quite healthy, but there is more to grow. And as we are seeing the utilization improve, our internal margins are back to the historical margins. Either they are where we can project them going forward as the utilization improves a bit more. The second effect is at SMSC. When we purchased SMSC, its full year operating margin in the year prior to our acquisition was only 12%. And until the time we were breaking it out, I think we had told you a quarter or so ago that we had more than doubled that operating profit. We're no longer breaking it out because the numbers are very intertwined. Operating expenses are very hard to figure out, what division they're going into. But based on our own assessments internally, that business now is performing as well as our own business withdrawal. This is how much we have improved then. And some of the long-term accretion is underway and yet to come. Every quarter, as it goes by, a higher and higher portion of their product is running into our factories for assembly and test purposes. And the ultimate accretion really comes from the market players where we are seeing an enormous sales opportunities sometimes developed in selling SMSC products around Microchip's consumer and industrial automotive customer sockets, which our sales and distribution network has identified an enormous opportunity. And some of them, we'll see them in later part of the next year, and some are longer term. But all those, they are very high margin into a Microchip business system. A lot of them will be coming from Microchip's ecosystem in terms of factories and all that, and will be very, very high margins. So that's another thing that's accreting. And the third order of effect is the licensing business.
Operator: And we will go next to John Pitzer of Crédit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Steve, clearly, one of the core competencies that you guys have proven over the last several years are finding and integrating these acquisitions. I'm kind of curious, relative to the answer to your last question, any way to quantify either through incremental TAM or the kind of incremental growth rates? Do you think these acquisitions have added to the core Microchip business? And I guess more importantly, are you now at a TAM level or expected growth rate level longer-term that you're satisfied with whether you see other opportunities to holding on acquisitions and integration?
Steve Sanghi: Well, it's difficult to put numbers on it, nor are we usually comfortable in putting numbers on it. Because, one, it projects too much. And secondly, it tells everybody else what we're doing, our competitors and others. So in general, I'm always uncomfortable in giving that kind of data. But let me give you one. If you look at our December quarter guidance, despite the December quarter being guided down 3%, our December quarter at that guidance, midpoint of the guidance, will be up 15% from December quarter of last year, 14.9% to be exact. And there's no acquisition in between. The December quarter last year had full SMSC in it. So December quarter last year to December quarter this year at the midpoint of the guidance will be up 14.9%. Who is up 14.9% right now? Most companies are down year-over-year and driving down further in December quarter. So you are seeing the result of internal core strengths in 8, 16, 32 and analog. You've seen this type of acquisitions. You're seeing our ability to take these acquisitions and digest them. And then be able to create more business out of them across our customers and sockets and all that. I don't know whether that answers your question.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: That's helpful, Steve. And maybe as a quick follow-on. Historically, you guys have given us sort of revenue detail by product, less so by end market given how much goes to distribution. I'm just kind of curious, as you think about exploiting things like the auto end market vertical, do you -- does the curved distribution model work as well or will you start having operationally more of an end market focus to try to exploit some of these revenue opportunities?
Steve Sanghi: We have always had selected end market focus. We told you that when we acquired SMSC. One of the criticism was that Microchip is a horizontal-focus company and SMSC is a vertical-focus company. And they don't fit. It was a bad acquisition, if you recall. Microchip has always run the automotive business in a vertical market fashion for years, 12 years, 15 years plus. Our automotive business does not go through distribution. We do business with all large automotive companies and their suppliers. And that has always been handled by Microchip's dotted sales force. So SMSC's automotive business fit very, very well along with that. And we have found substantial incremental opportunity on SMSC's automotive sockets around really our business and vice versa. Same as the case, we did business directly with a number of large computing manufacturers which will not go through distribution. And same way, SMSC's business fit very well with that. And we have found sockets around each of those -- sockets and business units. So Microchip has always been a mixture of a broad-based long-tail horizontal company, yet executing only large number of vertical focuses very, very well. We have had a vertical focus on automotive, home appliances, medical, energy, which material is it?
James Eric Bjornholt: Touch.
Steve Sanghi: Touch.
James Eric Bjornholt: From an interface test.
Steve Sanghi: I would say a bunch of display driving and all that.
James Eric Bjornholt: That was automotive infotainment. I mean, it's a pretty broad range.
Steve Sanghi: Automotive infotainment, model control, connectivities. So there are a number of large vertical application kind of areas that we had really managed very well internally, and really have a dual sale structure with centers of expertise in various markets that work together with a horizontal sales force.
James Eric Bjornholt: So maybe if you're assuming that because the distribution sales are quite large, that those are not customers we target. There's a good portion of distribution revenue that actually has resulted from Microchip creating the demand. But will our customers choose what the best fulfillment channel for them is, and in many cases that's direct, and in some cases, that's distribution. But distribution customers are not left just to distribution to create a demand
Operator: And we will take our next question from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley.
Unknown Analyst: This is [indiscernible]. I'm dialing in for Craig. So microcontrollers have been really strong for the last few quarters. So could you talk more about your 32-bit microcontrollers? Like what applications are they seeing the stronger design traction? And also, could you just compare your 32-bit product introductions this year related to last year?
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh, you want the last part of the question? And how do we compare our new product introductions this year to last year?
Ganesh Moorthy: Okay. So let me start with the second part of the question. We're -- obviously, we're accelerating data new product introduction. And as I mentioned, you're going to see some blockbuster announcements coming in the month of November. It's an area where we have been continuing to increase investment over the last several years. We're building out portfolio to fill out range of different memory sizes, functionalities, packet sizes, et cetera, et cetera, to build a strong portfolio that can be used in many, many different applications. And you'll see that as we move into 2014. That breadth of products will continue to accelerate. In terms of the applications themselves, they are often in the kinds of applications where our 16-bit microcontrollers are. They are run-of-the-mill applications. They can be in power supplies, in the human interface and motor control and in general. Then you'll find them in coffee machines and cars and broad range of applications, but where that is more needed in terms of either performance, memory, features or otherwise than what our 16-bit portfolio can provide. And so we provide a seamless migration in the way that we have planned our products that customers can go up and down, our microcontroller range of products, in the case of 32-bit most often from our 16-bit products up. And there's nothing earth-shattering about a brand new application that our 32-bit is in that is driving all the design. So it's pretty a broad range of designs, a broad range of applications that we're designed into.
Unknown Analyst: Got it, that's helpful. From a follow-up, like as I said, like SMSC integration is broadly complete. And it's on the same target model now. What is your appetite for additional acquisitions? And what's the biggest holdup currently? Is this pricing, the lack of target? Like what is your plan going forward?
Steve Sanghi: Our appetite is very good, but we don't have a target.
Ganesh Moorthy: And we're disciplined about how we approach it.
Steve Sanghi: We're disciplined about how we approach it. We have passed on a number of targets that we have looked at for various reasons, the lack of faith, not priced appropriately. Our synergies stick with our business for various other reasons. But if investors and analysts were to give us ideas, we'll be happy to take them. Don't expect feedback on them whether where we are in the process after to give us that idea, but we do not have a target today.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] All right, and we will go to our next question. That is Terence Whalen from Citi.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: My question wanted to focus on licensing, in particular. It sounds like based on the increase in the target profitability model, you're continuing to expect licensing to be a strong portion of that profitability. I just wanted to understand going forward, how we should think about modeling that line, whether that line can continue to grow or whether there are any certain sort of expirations that we have to be aware of in terms of any terms of future cliff in licensing revenue?
Steve Sanghi: The licensing revenue is very broad. We essentially have most foundries in the world of license, lots of larger IDM customers to license. There are many market segments, microcontrollers, SoCs, FPGAs, smartcards and others that run on using our process technologies. So it's a fairly broad-based business. And really, there is no very major lumpiness in it like you shouldn't expect in one quarter, you come in, it goes down 50%, and if you like that because of some expiry. There are lots of different process that we're getting royalties all the way on 0.5, 0.35, 0.25, 0.18, 0.13, 0.11, and 90-nanometer and 55. And so it's really very broad. And it's just a few things will go down in volume while the new ones are going up. So I think -- I don't know whether that answers your question, but you shouldn't be concerned about any major reduction of any kind.
James Eric Bjornholt: And there are ongoing new licensees that are coming on board.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. So steady and stable, it sounds like. The quick follow-up I had was a longer-term technology question. As you sort of evaluate the development of the Internet of Things, I know that's a very broad and loose term. But do you feel like you have the right capabilities? And where do you see the opportunities? Do you have the correct RF Technology, in particular that pair with your controllers?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's a market we've been in for a while. And there are several ingredient capabilities that are needed to enable customers who want to reach an Internet of Things solutions. So if you look at -- and fundamentally, you need some form of microcontroller in these applications. Often these are applications we're already designed in. And a customer is now looking to extend the capability to connect to the Internet. So let's look at a thermostat as an example. If you take a standard thermostat, we've been in it for 20-plus years with analog functionality, microcontroller functionality. Now customers that have the thermostat who wants to be able to connect to the Internet takes advantage of our wireless capability. In most cases, it will be a Wi-Fi connection that we can enable, and we have enabled using our Wi-Fi modules that we provide. In other cases, it might be a proprietary wireless that then has a way to get back into the Internet. The other big challenge that many customers have is, well, how do they manage the other side of this which is the cloud itself? Some customers are sophisticated and have the ability to manage how they have a setup on the cloud that can receive the data and then be able to do something with it. But we have many customers for whom that is new. And as you saw earlier this week, we announced a partnership with Amazon. Actually, it was last week that we announced to be able be help host these capabilities, and enable people to take advantage of existing solutions, but get on the cloud with their applications. So we believe we have put together with our existing solutions and with partnerships for the cloud, the ingredients that are needed for anybody who has an Internet of Things thought process or application that they want to get into.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Shaon Baqui - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is Shaon Baqui calling in for Chris. I just want to get your thoughts real quick on the various GEOs [ph], if you're seeing any particular areas of strength here as we look in the December quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Eric?
James Eric Bjornholt: So I mean, typically, what we will see in the December quarter is that due to the holidays, we'll see Europe and the Americas have some stress on the business. And Asia typically does okay, but it's not enough to offset the weakness that we see out of Europe and the Americas. So it's really a holiday-driven phenomena, just like we see in the March quarter with Asia being week due to the Chinese New Year.
Shaon Baqui - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And this is a quick follow-up as we look into the December quarter. Can you give us kind of the puts and takes in your guidance? Are there any segments here that meant to your analog particularly that may be up or down a little bit more than the others?
Ganesh Moorthy: We don't really break out by segment.
Steve Sanghi: We have 14 product divisions inside Microchip internally, how we manage it. And it's just too many. We bucket them for you in a way to 16 and 32 analog and all that, but it's much broader internally. And some of them have multiple things in one division. So I can't break it down any further.
Operator: And we will go next to go Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates.
Gilbert Alexandre: Two questions, if I may ask. Could you give us an idea of your factory utilization at this time?
Steve Sanghi: So historically, we have not given a number on factory utilization. The problem is that there's a tendency then to draw a straight line and try to figure out every point of utilization means we're done on gross margin and kind of track and expect that as utilization goes up or down. In what we have seen has historically reached to long conclusions because in one quarter, unfair portion of our growth may come from foundry products. And other time, they come from internally. And not all products have same gross margins, and depending on what you're running in a given quarter. So it's a very complex mix. And we are, in general, not comfortable with trying to tie a given utilization to a given gross margin. Our utilization has not peaked yet compared to where it was before. There is a significant more accretion to go. And we -- many months -- several more quarters as we continue to increase the utilization for the gross margin to continue to really go higher. And then eventually, utilization will go beyond that. But we're not running all the equipment that we have in our factories flat out. This means the utilization still has a way to go.
Gilbert Alexandre: All right. My second question, on your return from Asia, can you give us any reasonable reading of the Chinese economic growth?
Steve Sanghi: So our China business did enormously well. In fact, that's when we break it out, right, in the queue?
James Eric Bjornholt: Well, we break out the percentage of the total revenue. And it's approaching 29% of the total now.
Steve Sanghi: If you break it out in percentage, they can figure out the dollars.
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes.
Steve Sanghi: So where does it grow quarter-over-quarter sequentially?
James Eric Bjornholt: I do not have that in front of me.
Steve Sanghi: But it was a very, very strong growth. So 6.5% overall growth. The highest growth, I think, was still also double-digit. I recall seeing it. So China did very, very well. The China GDP numbers in the latest report were slightly revised upwards. So despite what you hear in China, China business is very solid.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Kevin Cassidy of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. I was wondering if you could describe how the 32-bit market may differ from 8 and 16 in terms of perhaps what customers are looking for or the product needs. And as a follow-up, how you would view your progress in this market so far compared to the previous markets?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, I want you to think of 32-bit as not a separate market. It's one continuum of microcontroller markets for which different products serve the needs of that market. There is a range, performance, memory size and features at which the 32-bit is the right product to be able to use in those applications. Often at the boundary between 16 and 32-bit, you're going to have 16 bits that are in the 32-bit type of applications and vice versa. The -- our own progress here has been outstanding. You can take a look at the last many years over which we have reported our sequential, as well as our year-over-year growth. And it's been significant. Obviously, several years ago, it was growing off of a very small base, but it has continued to grow into a reasonably sized business for us. That product portfolio has expanded in that timeframe. The third available market that we can target has grown with that. And perhaps, the -- in that continuum of 8s, 16s and 32s, the largest change is really the software intensity that is involved in these applications. And so in addition to the silicon level of products, there's a significant software investment that we have to make and being able to enable solutions. And we have done that. And we expect to be doing more of that along with our silicon products in 32-bit in the coming months and years.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Harsh Kumar of Stephens.
Richard Sewell - Stephens Inc., Research Division: This is Richard in for Harsh. I just wanted to get your sense on seasonality. You talked about the seasonality in the December and March quarter, but have you seen any changes in the June and September quarters with the addition of SMSC?
Steve Sanghi: No. If you -- actually, did not seem to have changed our seasonality. June and September quarters were very strong. March quarter was good. June was excellent. September was excellent. December is seasonally normal. And we're expecting March to be seasonally normal, which would be up in the single-digits.
Richard Sewell - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Great. And my follow-on relates to SMSC as well. Have you seen any benefits from the back end integration yet? And if not, when do you expect to see those benefits?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. We have seen benefit from the back -- integration of the back end. There were some in the June quarter, much more in September quarter to be even more in December. So it's really continuing, and also requires capital investment to bring some of the deal. And we're doing it at a controlled pace.
Operator: And this does concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the call back to our moderators for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Okay. We want to thank everyone for attending this call. We'll be at some conferences. I believe the next one is...
James Eric Bjornholt: Well, the next conference will be at the Credit Suisse Conference in Phoenix. We'll also be at the NASDAQ Conference in London and doing some marketing throughout the quarter.
Steve Sanghi: So we'll certainly see some of you at the CSFB Conference in Scottsdale. I will promise a great weather here in its hometown. So please come and see us. Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude today's conference call. Once again, we would like to thank everyone for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to this Microchip Technology First Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
James Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to press our release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operation. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2014 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Net sales in the June quarter were a record $462.8 million and were up 7.6% sequentially from net sales of $430.1 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Revenue by product line was $300.3 million for microcontrollers, $103.2 million for analog, $34 million for memory and $22.5 million for licensing, and $2.8 million of other. Revenue by geography was $86.9 million in the Americas, $101.2 million in Europe and $274.6 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58% from the June quarter and above the high end of our upwardly revised guidance provided on June 3 of 57.25%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27.5% of sales. Non-GAAP operating income was 30.5% of sales, and net income was a record at $120.4 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.57 per diluted share, which was $0.03 above the mid-point of our upwardly revised guidance and $0.05 above the mid-point of our original guidance. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 57.6% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins included the impact of $2 million of share-based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $168.2 million or 36.3% of sales, and include acquisition, intangible amortization and special charges totaling $29.4 million and also include share-based compensation of $10.7 million. The GAAP net income was $78.6 million or $0.37 per diluted share. In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.1% and the GAAP tax rate was 13%. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effects of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any one-time events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5% to 11.5%. To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share on the June quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.138, share-based compensation was about $0.053 and noncash interest expense was about $0.006. The dividend declared today at $0.354 per share will be paid on September 4, 2013, to shareholders of record on August 21, 2013. The cash payment associated with this dividend will approximately be $70 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 44th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made a reduction in our dividend. And in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 38th occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividends paid is over $2 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. Moving onto the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at June 30, 2013, was $256.1 million or 119 days. The mix of our inventory between internally produced and externally sourced product is in better alignment than it was at the end of March, and our inventory position is within our target model. We expect days of inventory at the end of September quarter to be relatively flat to the June quarter levels. Inventory at our distributors increased by 2 days during the June quarter to 32 days and remain at very low levels compared to where they have been historically. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. At June 30, the consolidated accounts receivable balance increased to $232.3 million, driven by the increases in quarterly revenue and the inventory build by our distributors. Receivable balances are in great condition, with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. We had strong free cash flow generation in the June quarter of $138.9 million prior to our dividend payment. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $1.9 billion, and we had $610 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit.  Excluding dividend payments, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $110 million to $130 million in the September quarter. During the June quarter, we executed a new $2 billion revolving credit facility that has a 5-year term. The new facility replaces the $750 million facility that was previously in place. The new facility provides us with additional flexibility to pursue our business objectives with minimal immediate income statement impact based on our current level of borrowing activity. Capital spending was approximately $27.8 million for the June quarter and included rollover capital from the March quarter and a $12.5 million R&D building purchase in India. We expect about $27 million in capital spending in the September quarter. We expect overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2014 to be about $90 million, as we are adding capital to support the growth of our business. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $21.4 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric. And good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines in the June quarter. Our microcontroller business grew a strong 8.9% sequentially in the June quarter to achieve an all-time record of $300.3 million in revenue. Microcontroller revenue was also up 24.8% versus the year-ago quarter. All 3 microcontroller segments grew significantly, with 16-bit and 32-bit achieving new records and 8-bit within a hair's breadth of achieving a new record. We fully expect that 8-bit microcontrollers will set a new record in the September quarter. Microcontrollers represented 64.9% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. And in April, we shipped our 12 billionth cumulative microcontroller. Additionally, we shipped a record number of development systems in the June quarter, which bodes well for future growth. Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 10.1% sequentially in the June quarter, achieving a new record for revenue. 16-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 71.7% versus the year-ago quarter. We continue to expand the breadth of innovative 16-bit solutions that we're offering, customers that we are serving and applications that we're winning, as we continue to gain market share in this segment. Our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 26.3% sequentially in the June quarter, coming back strong after a pause in the March quarter to set a new record for revenue. 32-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 362% over the year-ago quarter. We are continuing to win new designs and expanding into new applications to enable further growth in revenue and market share. Despite the questions that some analysts have had about our choice of core, our consistent growth provides market confirmation of our belief that what customers care most about is that we offer a PIC microcontroller solution with all the attendant brand promises and that the choice of core is not as important. Moving to our analog business. Our analog business grew 6.2% sequentially in the June quarter to also achieve a new record and continues to perform exceptionally well. Analog revenue was also up 119% versus the year-ago quarter. Analog revenue represented 22.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. And at a $413 million annual sales run rate, it has quietly become one of the larger analog franchises in the industry. We are continuing to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E2PROM memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was up 3.7% sequentially. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business was down to 7.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. With that, let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to reflect on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2014, then I will provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2014. We were very pleased with our execution in the June quarter. In early June, we raised our guidance from what we had provided in our earnings conference call in May. Our actual net sales exceeded even the higher end of our revised guidance. The gross margin percentage was 163 basis points better than March quarter and exceeded the high end of our revised guidance by 78 basis points, as we increased factory output to meet the increased sales. Our operating profit percentage once again exceeded 30%, and we are making good progress towards our long-term goal of 32.5% operating profit. Non-GAAP earnings per share also exceeded the high end of our revised guidance and meet our original guidance by $0.05 per share. We made several new all-time records in the quarter. Our total net sales, microcontroller net sales and analog net sales all achieved new records. Individually, 16-bit microcontrollers and 32-bit microcontrollers also achieved new all-time records. Our 8-bit microcontroller revenue came within 3% of its all-time high, further validating what we have been saying, which is that our 8-bit microcontroller business is very healthy, growing and very profitable. Our 8-bit MCU business is continuing to gain share from competitors, who have either moved away from 8-bit or otherwise are uncompetitive and cannot make money in the 8-bit MCU. We are also continuing to gain market share in 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers and analog. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in making this an excellent quarter in every respect. Last, but not the least, the March quarter was our 91st consecutive profitable quarter. Regarding SMSC, I would like to comment that for the June quarter, the SMSC division delivered an impressive $0.10 accretion, which was in the high end of our $0.09 to $0.10 range that we have provided. The accretion was up from $0.085 in the March quarter. SMSC's operating profit in the June quarter was about 27% of sales, up from 12% in the last full year prior to the acquisition. SMSC businesses are now very well integrated and intertwined with Microchip, and that breaking out of the numbers is increasingly difficult and not worth the effort. Therefore, this is the last time we will comment on it by saying that we have more than delivered on the promise of SMSC acquisition and there is more to come from the longer-term synergies in manufacturing on the cost side and revenue on the sales side. Near the beginning of the month of June, we completely reversed the rotating time-off in our factories and recalled all employees to full-time work. During last month, we also reversed the pay cut of over 2,500 employees, who had volunteered for a 5% pay cut last November. These employees also received an extra bonus last quarter as a shared reward for their shared sacrifice. This continues to exemplify the strength and uniqueness of our Microchip culture. Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2014. We have continued to see very strong bookings and expedite requests in our business driven by strong demand in our design win pipeline. The book-to-bill ratio was strongly positive in the June quarter. The starting backlog for September quarter was significantly higher than the starting backlog for the June quarter. However, we continue to have lead time challenges, mainly driven by longer lead time from our foundries. We are getting good visibility from our customers, but many new bookings will still be scheduled to be around the end of this quarter. Taking all these factors into account, we expect Microchip's total net sales in the September quarter to be up between 2% and 6% sequentially. Several investors and analysts have asked to -- what explains significant growth that Microchip business has experienced in the last 2 quarters and going into the current quarter? The answer lies in which sectors Microchip does business. In the last calendar year, smartphones and tablets were very strong, while the other sectors were struggling in a weak economy. This year, the smartphone sector is weak, as evidenced by reports of several semiconductor companies with strong exposure to that market. This year, the strong sectors are housing, industrial and automotive, the 3 sectors that Microchip has very strong exposure to. While we do not break out our business by these sectors, just looking at some sample customers, we see significant strength in customers that sell products for housing, industrial and automotive. We believe that in general, investors and analysts may have overlooked Microchip's outside exposure to these markets. Our internal inventory is now fully corrected, and we are ramping our fabs, as well as back-end facilities, to meet the increased demand. Last quarter, our finished goods inventory went down significantly, as we shipped products into strong demand. Our facilities have now switched from lowering finished goods inventory to rebuilding finished goods stock to reduce lead times and meet the increased demand of our customers. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.1% to 58.7% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 27% and 27.5% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 30.6% to 31.7% of sales. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.58 and $0.62 per share. Our long-term model for the combined company remains a gross margin of about 60%, plus/minus 0.5%, operating expenses of about 27.5%, plus or minus 0.5%, and operating profit of about 32.5%, plus or minus, 0.5%. All of these numbers are non-GAAP. This long-term model will continue to be a premium model in the semiconductor industry. This, together with one of the highest dividends in the semiconductor industry, will continue to generate excellent shareholder value. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we expect that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to press corp. With this, Angela, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Christopher Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I guess with -- I'll start with a high-level question, and I understand your comments with regard to some of the strengths in some of the broader segments, such as housing, industrial and automotive. As you talk to your customers and your distributors, perhaps, you could tell us what gives you confidence that the orders that you're seeing do, in fact, reflect real demand, and perhaps, you could talk little bit about the inventory levels to the extent you have visibility into your customers.
Steve Sanghi: Well, our expedite activity is very high. We're just expediting products on multiple fronts, in multiple markets for customers in multiple geographies and multiple sectors. The -- there is really very little inventory at the end customer. While distributor inventory is lower compared to any historic norms. It was up 2 days last quarter, but still on the very low end of, really, the historical norms. So that's really what gives us confidence that the orders are real. We're not getting any net pushout activity or anything like that. There are always moving parts and somebody scheduled a few parts out, somebody else pulls it in. But the net-net debt demand continues to be very strong. The backlog is very healthy. And we are actually struggling to meet all of the demand we have in the current quarter.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. As a follow-up to that, obviously, you mentioned you're increasing production now in response to the order rates that you have in the inventory levels. Could you remind us the impact that the increased production would have on your gross margins? What sort of improvement can we expect going over the next couple of quarters? And as you talk about the 60% long-term gross margin target, is that tied to a particular revenue number? And if so, would you care to share that with us?
Steve Sanghi: So it is tied to a particular number, but we cannot share that. There is internal modeling on it. But if you look at it at the bottom of this cycle -- do you recall what our gross margin was? I think it was 55-point-something, yes?
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes, I think that's right.
Steve Sanghi: Something in that area. So the gross margin has continued to come up every quarter. Going into this quarter, at the last conference call, our guidance for the gross margin for the current quarter was 57%. And we delivered 58.04% or something. Actually, I just got the number. The gross margin at the bottom of this cycle was 56%. So I could see that we have come up substantially. And it's come with higher utilization, recalling all the employees back for -- back to a fab-sorting production, and we're currently increasing wafer starts further. So the impact of the gross margin is very positive. We're guiding another increase in gross margin this quarter from 58% last quarter to a mid-point of about 58.4%. And depending on how the quarter goes, I guess further strengthen it, there can be upside to that. And gross margin will continue to increase. Our long-term target is 60%, and there's another 200 basis points to go.
Operator: And we will now go to Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could address some of the longer-dated backlog you referred to in your opening commentary, say, some of it was out past the end of September quarter. Can you maybe give us some context how much of the bookings are scheduled past the end of the quarter or this quarter versus last quarter to the quarter before?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the bookings have been strong now for a couple of quarters. I think this is a repeat comment that we made last quarter also. So from that standpoint, there is not really a substantial change in that. I think what's more important is how much of the backlog customers are requesting in a current quarter, but we're giving them few days out. We're getting significant visibility. So there's a fair amount of backlog into next quarter already. But that is a request in the next quarter, we're delivering in the next quarter. That business is normal. The problem is where certain portion of the backlog, customers will take it in September, and we are just scheduled out a week or 2 weeks out. We're struggling hard to pull it in, and we'll be successful in some and not in some other.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful color. And then as a follow-on, could you maybe talk about how much your internal factory utilization has increased over the past several quarters from, say, trough to the current levels? In other words, maybe if you can express it in points, that'll be helpful.
Steve Sanghi: We don't like to give that numerically. But with the rotating time-off, we have taken the production down significantly. And a lot of that has come back, and we have increased production even beyond that to really meet the current demand and we'll continue to increase it. But neither I have the numerical numbers in front of me nor do we like to share that.
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes, and it's a mix between our wafer fab and our assembly and test. And assembly and test is cranking out a lot of product today and this is what we utilize.
Steve Sanghi: Yes, so there are 2 other factors. One is assembly and test, which we have been ramping it all last quarter in the fall because a lot of the inventory we had built during slow time was being held up at the high level. So if the demand came back, we can immediately crank up the back end to start to produce more output. The fab cycle time takes longer to improve the output. So that's one factor. The second factor is, as we mentioned in the last conference call, 40% of our dye production now comes from outside foundries, where we do not produce them internally. And there, we are dealing with foundry lead times and queue times and others. And I don't really have -- under our full control were we can expedite around fab.
Operator: And we will now go to John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just to follow up on the gross margin line. Steve, given that you guys started to re-ramp, it sounds more aggressively, at beginning June. I would have thought that you would have gotten a better utilization at maybe in the September quarter, not that the absolute number is a bad number at all. I'm just kind of curious. When you look at the revenue mix in the September quarter, is more of it coming from the 40% that's now outsourced and that's why you're not getting the leverage, or can you help me understand the incremental gross margins in September versus June which were very strong?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we started improving output in -- probably, in the middle of the quarter and we recalled the people a little bit later as the line got filled up. So we got more than probably just a month. Secondly, we got a very large increase. The attrition out of the back end, which we were expediting the entire quarter because the dye was healthy. So this quarter, we don't really get as much incremental out of the back end. Because the back end, we had to fill last time. And you add a little bit more of the fab. So when you average it, I mean that's sort of the result we get.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: That's helpful. And then, Steve, on the top line. When you look at the strength, both in June and September, if you -- how much of that do you attribute to just the inventory level being a lot leaner than a lot of us recognize versus, perhaps, Microchip gaining share versus, I guess even the third bucket is maybe some revenue synergies that you're starting to get with the SMSC acquisition?
Steve Sanghi: Well, there are several questions in there, a bunch of moving parts. But I don't really think customers, end customers, usually hold a lot of inventory these days. The inventory really gets all pushed down to ODMs and distributors and eventually, the semiconductor manufacturer. But the end customer inventory was just totally dry up in a slow time because, probably, the lead times are very short. So as of the demand strengthened, the first step we see is the significant increase in the expedite activity and we rush to provide a product to them. And then it's not whole, and it catches on and the customer set can give you longer-term orders because they see lead times going long. So we don't you see as much change in the end customer inventory that they're holding. It's mostly the pipeline that we have. We're getting much better visibility today than we got it in January.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Steve, relative to perhaps Microchip gaining share and/or revenue synergies with the recent acquisition?
Steve Sanghi: So share gains are obvious. You could just kind of do the math. We grew, I think, 3.4% in the March quarter. Add the current quarter growth to that, you're dealing with over 10% growth in just the first 2 quarters and add the one we're guiding to for the September. So from December quarter to September quarter, you will see growth somewhere in the 14%-plus range, cumulatively more than that. So that's a significant growth. Obviously, the markets and economy are not growing that strong. So somehow, a lot of that is growth. A lot of that is new products. A lot of them are exposure to stronger segments and a combination of all those. And there is some part of that, which is the third comment you made, getting some revenue accretion from SMSC. Yes, we've gotten some of that, but that's longer-term. Much of that is still on the design win stage, and we will continue to comment in the year, this year, next year and the year after. But some of it is there.
Operator: And we will now go to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Steve, I have a couple of questions. Microchip always does very well when coming off of periods in bad markets. You guys always end up taking a bunch of share. This happened in '09. It's happening again. I'm curious what drives that? It's got to be just more than just having a strong balance sheet relative to your competitors. I'm wondering if you could give us some color on that.
Ganesh Moorthy: During the down cycles, we continued to stay invested in our product roadmaps. We continued to stay invested in our customers and the support that they need to design in with our products and we continued to work on our internal operational efficiencies. And that's what the shared sacrifice approach takes, is we -- keeps our people intact, keeps our systems intact, we get the expense reductions we need, positions us for strength as we come out of these. That's exactly what happened in the '09, '10 time frame and exactly what we're doing here between 2012 and 2013. And in all of that, we're able to outperform people with the investments we've made, as well as with the operational improvements we've made.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: And then second question, as a follow-up. Steve, I think you touched upon this a little bit earlier. Gross margin of, call it, 58% and change, a long-term goal of 60%. What's the biggest factor in getting there?
Steve Sanghi: The biggest factor in getting there is really getting the production higher. We are not at the peak production from a factory as yet. When we had higher gross margins at -- the peak production from our factory goes higher, more of the product is now running in the outside foundries for various different reasons. We're ramping production inside, but we're not at the peak production yet. So I think that's the biggest factor. And then there are a lot of the second and third effects, a whole bunch of SMSC, probe, assembly and test is driving the Microchip factories, which will continue to have accretive effect in the coming year. There is cost reduction, some conversion to new technologies. But those are a bunch of moving parts that happen in our business all the time. And I think the 2 different changes that are not always normal is number one, getting back to a higher production, and number two, completing some of the longer-term accretion items in the SMSC acquisition. SMSC integration is complete. It's running as one company that's fully intertwined. But some of the longer-term items are transferring some of their assembly and test, pro production to inside longer-term items, which are continuing.
Operator: And we will now go to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Can you just give us a little more color on the lead time situations? I guess, what percentage of product is seeing the increased lead times? What are normal, where have they gone to now and when -- or what it depends on, do you think they'll get their lead times back to normal value?
James Eric Bjornholt: There's no such thing as a fixed lead time. It's a pretty broad range. There are products in which the lead times are small as 3, 4 weeks or available off-the-shelf in some cases, and others where lead times are going to be north of 12 to 16 weeks, in that range. It's a function of what source they come from, what the inventory position on them is, what the demand picture looks like. We have so many line items that are spread across, that there's not a single lead time thing. We're continuously working on the improvement of the supply to meet our customers' requirements and bring the lead times in. And that's an ongoing challenge. Obviously, for some of it that's inside Microchip, it's an easier approach. We have more control on being able to affect change. For some of the things that are outside, we work with the foundries and do the normal things that people who use outside our fabs do to try and get our fair share.
Steve Sanghi: I could give you 2 extremes. The shortest lead time is a product we can build in our fabs and we can fully assemble and test it in our factory and ship it. And on a product where there are thousands of customers, hundreds and thousands of customers, a very broad, high-volume product with just lots and lots of customers buying it. Because on that product, we can build it inside plus we can build inventory because it has a broad usage. That will have the shortest lead time and most likely on the shelf. You go to the other extreme, and you take a product that runs at a foundry, gets probe, assembled and tested outside, hasn't been brought it yet either as SMSC product or could be one of our product that runs outside. And if you add on the top of that, especially a product that has a very narrow customer base, 1 or 2 customers buy it, and it doesn't really have a broad-based usage in consumer, industrial communication, PC, a lot of Microchip products, then we cannot build a lot of inventory because the inventory can go obsolete. And some of that product is largely distant -- built on specific customer demand, either on order or understanding with the customers. So that will have the longest lead time. Those 2 are the extremes. And you have -- and that extreme could be 18 weeks. The lowest that is built inside is off-the-shelf. And then, there are products all over the place. That are maybe fab-ed inside, tested outside or fab outside, tested inside, small customer base, large customer base, all over the place. We sell over 100,000 SKUs.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then another, I guess, my follow-up question, is just on cash and cash management. So as you guys have talked about and as you're demonstrating, is that some of the best margins and some of the highest dividend yields in your space. Is it -- probably, you have your cash and growth continues to outpace dividend growth? And you also have a little bit of share count creep over the last several quarters. So I'm just wondering, do you think about having some sort of regular token buyback? Or do you think about maybe increasing the dividend a little more? And then if you could also address why you increased the revolver to, I mean to $2 billion up from $750 million?
James Eric Bjornholt: Okay. So from a cash basis, obviously, we've been very committed to the dividend program, and that's where our priority is over any share buyback. It's pretty clear in our public documents and how we talk to investors that we have a lot more cash offshore than we have onshore. So we want to be selective on how we use that cash and returning it to shareholders through the dividend program. And so stock buyback is not something that we are considering any time in the near future. We would consider it if the market did something crazy with the stock, that will be something and we have to revisit with the board. So that's primarily where we're focused on. The facility that was put in place in late June with the new revolver. It's essentially an expansion of what we had before. We had a $750 million line of credit before. We've expanded that up to $2 billion. We were borrowing roughly $600 million on that revolver at the end of the quarter, $610 million. And that is essentially dry powder for us for any expansion requirements that we see in U.S. through acquisition or any other strategic mean.
Steve Sanghi: Can you get also the question on share creep?
James Eric Bjornholt: Share creep. So yes, the share creep is driven by just ongoing equity programs that we have. But the largest factor there is the convertible debt that we have outstanding and the dilution that comes with that with additional shares outstanding as the stock price increases. And so the stock prices out, obviously, gone up over the last quarter. And what we factored into our guidance here is about $40 average stock price, not knowing where else to peg that for the September quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go next to Sumit Dhanda with ISI.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Yes, a couple of questions, guys. On -- mainly on geographic trends. First one on that, Steve, have you seen anything that suggests that the time of business, especially from a white goods or appliance perspective, are you seeing any slowdown or pertubation[ph], given all the concerns on the economy there? And then, as you look into the September quarter, are there particular geographies you expect to outperform versus the others? Or is it mainly a seasonal pattern as it relates to the individual geographies?
Steve Sanghi: Well, our China business is very strong. And at the first blush would not jive with the substitute reading. We read the reports on both sides. And things are good and things are slowing down in China, but our results don't speak for that. So either it could be a significant market share gain. It could also be the segments we are in, sectors we are serving. And it could also be that the China market is on the lower end of the bit scale. There isn't as much to apply that 32-bit over there. There's a lot of 8 and 16-bit market. And our product lines are very, very healthy. We're gaining a lot of share in 8 and, 16, we got nearly 1,000 products in those segments. And as other competitors may have miscalculated that transition and have maybe consolidated all their resources on 32-bit and very much supported by analysts' viewpoint, I must say, probably didn't serve them well.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Got you. And then in terms of the outlook into the September quarter, is there something you expect from a geographic perspective that's different from outside the norm of seasonality?
Steve Sanghi: No, this is a -- September quarter is usually a weak quarter in Europe. And the normal quarter in U.S. and Asia, and we won't expect anything different. All the sentiment from Europe is that Europe is on demand. I mean Europe was in recession. The business in the [indiscernible] countries is very, very small, especially for our kind of products. Germany is very, very strong and the sentiment is very good in Germany and the reports that we are getting and the activity we are seeing in Europe. Europe is on the mend. In fact, Europe would have a seasonally stronger summer than they historically have relative to the June quarter.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just one more question, Steve. You mentioned that bringing some of the back end operations for SMSC announced will help the gross margins. Is that fully comprehended in your 60% target? Or do think that could be a source of additional upside to the long-term target?
Steve Sanghi: That, I choose not to be granular about. There are lots of moving parts in trying to get there. And I want to leave some room there. So I don't really know. Like we have an internal model, but I don't want to share the total parameters of that model.
Operator: And we will now go to Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Steve, I think you referred to there being some sort of longer-term areas of integration of SMSC that had not yet been realized. With accretion being $0.10 a quarter and the fiscal year target being, I think, $0.40 to $0.45. I want to understand if this longer-term accretion opportunities were factored into that $0.40 to $0.45 accretion for the fiscal year or if you're talking about some opportunities with levels beyond that?
Steve Sanghi: So some of that is factored into going from $0.10 where we are at, to trying to get to the $0.40 to $0.45 for the year. But especially the sales part of the synergies are beyond that. So we're getting a lot of new designs into automotive and audio and the computing segment with Microchip products next to SMSC products and set top boxes and USB and Ethernet and LAN and other places. And a lot of those are 1 year, 1.5-year design cycles. So that's not all going to be in here this year. Some yes, some not. You're seeing stronger growth, and that stronger growth and market share gains are driven by a lot of our core growth, but are also getting some help from having a broader platform where products can sit next to each other. That will continue for several years. The manufacturing piece that brings accretion, we will not be completed with all the manufacturing transfers inside Microchip by the end of this year, either. Some of that will go into fiscal year 2015.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, very helpful. My follow-up question is regarding projected utilization. Specifically, if under a scenario, that revenue, let's say, were flat in a seasonably softer December quarter, would that warrant you taking utilization up further in the December quarter from your planned September levels?
Steve Sanghi: If December quarter is seasonally flat to September quarter, then we, probably would ramp the fab a little bit on some specific leading-edge technologies where the demand is very strong. And those technologies are more complex so they require more steps, but they will not be a meaningful change if the underlying business was flat.
James Eric Bjornholt: Right. We're projecting inventory to be relatively flat in the current quarter. It's within our model. So I agree with that.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Maybe I can ask the question a different way. What's the ramification of now having a higher outsourced model? Are you going to experience lower utilization declines in seasonally weaker periods or is this not going to be necessarily used on a small quarter-to-quarter basis, just in larger cyclical correction?
Steve Sanghi: Well, so having 40% of our business at foundries, what it gives us, I believe, is if 100% of the business came from inside, when the downturn comes, we have to absorb it all inside, cut production and have a deeper impact. When 40% of the business comes from foundries, it's easier to cut production in foundries without having a negative impact on it because of foundries are observing the utilization essentially. So actually, the model gets better slightly. It has some other negative ramifications. You have less than control and longer lead times and all that. But in a slow time, it helps you to correct the inventory much more rapidly.
Operator: And we will now go to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. In the 32-bit controller market, there appears to be a wider variety of architectures and approaches, like multi-core processors and more complex schemes. Could you provide your view on the extent to which 32-bit market may be different? Or do you think these type of complex schemes really are not relevant in that space?
Ganesh Moorthy: 32-bit market is a large market. There are lots of opportunities for Microchip as we push into a broader range of 32-bit products. I don't want to comment on any specific architectural or other improvements we are heading towards. But clearly, we're aware and paying attention to the customers and markets that we either serve or plan to serve, and have a roadmap consistent with being able to push the different parameters, performance, features, costs and otherwise, in the 32-bit market.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: As a follow-up on a different tactic, can you please provide us with an update on your onshore, offshore cash position?
James Eric Bjornholt: Sure. So our onshore cash is somewhere between $50 million and $100 million. We obviously have our credit facility that we can tap into and it -- the less of the credit facility that we're using in the U.S., the lower our costs are. So we manage that as well as we can. But the vast majority of our cash is offshore. That's driven by the acquisitions that we've done that have been U.S.-sourced, taking up U.S. cash, and 80% of our business being offshore. So we've got a lot of the profits that earned offshore.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ray Rund with Shaker Investments.
Raymond Joseph Rund - Shaker Investments, L.L.C.: I was wondering, as you've mentioned, you've already got 40% of your business in foundries. And as you evolve towards more complex products, such as the 32-bit as that becomes a greater percentage of your run rate, have you given any thought to your process technology roadmap there? Are you considering increasing your capabilities so you might be able to maintain your foundry reliance at 40%? Or do you see this going up over time?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the reliance on the foundries has largely been driven by acquisition. The internal shift has been a smaller and slower portion of it because while in some advanced technologies and 32-bit and others, we have gone out, but we've also advanced the state of the technology inside, where some of the products that we're built outside several years ago are now built inside. So we have more ability to keep picking from it and keep that mix more reasonably stable. What has driven this number is really adding $400 million type of business at SMSC, which is all driven outside. And prior to that, the SST acquisition, where 100% of business was outside, plus some of the small transactions we have done, roaming networks in the networking area and other number of small transaction we have done in the last few years. That has been the primary reason why they're outside. When you don't have your own fab, you have the tendency to just go down and move slow and find the smallest technology you can find. And sometimes, it's not the best technology, but that's what fabless companies tend to do.
Operator: And it appears, there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Sanghi, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Okay. We want to thank everyone for attending this conference call. Microchip management and myself and Eric Bjornholt will be at Citibank conference in early September.
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes, also be at the Jefferies conference in August.
Steve Sanghi: Jefferies conference in August. So we'll see some of you at those conferences. Thank you. Bye-bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip Technology Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
James Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operation. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2013 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Net sales in the March quarter were a record $430.1 million and were up 3.4% sequentially from net sales of $416 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Revenue by product line was $275.8 million for microcontrollers, $97.2 million for analog, $32.8 million for memory, $22.1 million for licensing and $2.3 million of other. Revenue by geography was $84.7 million in the Americas, $99.3 million in Europe and $246.1 million in Asia. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 56.4% from the March quarter and above the high end of our guidance provided on February 7 of 56.25%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.6% of sales and well below the low end of our guidance of 29.25%. Non-GAAP operating income was 27.8% of sales, and net income was $109.3 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.52 per diluted share, which was $0.05 above the mid-point of our guidance and $0.03 above the high end of our guidance. Our EPS guidance and the actual results included about $0.03 from the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. For fiscal 2013, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were $1.606 billion and up 16.1% year-over-year. Gross margins were 57.2%, operating expenses were 28.6% of sales and operating income was 28.6% of sales. Net income was $388.5 million or $1.89 per diluted share. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 55.6% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins were impacted by the sell-through of $1.1 million of written up inventory costs associated with our acquisition and $2.5 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $182.3 million or 42.4% of sales, and include intangible amortization and special charges totaling $47.1 million and also includes share-based compensation of $10.9 million. The GAAP net income was $59.7 million or $0.28 per diluted share. For fiscal 2013, on a full GAAP basis, net sales were $1.582 billion. Gross margins were 53%. Operating expenses were 41.7% of sales, and operating income was 11.3% of sales. Net income was $127.4 million or $0.62 per diluted share. In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 4.5% and was favorably impacted by $6.5 million from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit relating to calendar year 2012. The GAAP tax expense was impacted by the acquisition-related items and several nonrecurring events. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect to various nonrecurring items. Excluding any one-time events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5% to 11.5%. To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the March quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.22, share-based compensation was about $0.056, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.046 and noncash interest expense was about $0.006. The dividend declared today of $0.3535 per share will be paid on June 4, 2013, to shareholders of record on May 21, 2013. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $69.6 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 43rd consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. In fact, this quarter's increase marks the 37th occasion we have increased the dividend payment. And when the dividend is paid, it will take our cumulative dividends paid to our shareholders to over $2 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at March 31, 2013, came down significantly to $242.3 million or 116 days. Our internally produced inventory is still a bit high, and our inventory purchased from foundries is low. We will continue to work on rightsizing the various components of our inventory holdings. We expect days of inventory at the end of the June quarter to be flat to up modestly, although we expect our internally produced inventory to decline again. Inventory at our distributors increased by 3 days during the March quarter from the record low levels we saw in the December quarter and are now at 30 days. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. At March 31, the consolidated accounts receivable balance increased to $230 million, driven by the back-end weighted shipments in the quarter associated with the Chinese New Year and the inventory build at our distributors. Receivable balance are in great condition, with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. We had strong free cash flow generation in the March quarter of $123.3 million prior to our dividend payment. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $1.84 billion, and we had $620 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $100 million to $120 million in the June quarter. Capital spending was approximately $15.5 million for the March quarter and $51.6 million for fiscal 2013. The capital spending in Q4 was about $8.5 million below our forecast for the quarter, with these capital receipts pushing into Q1 of fiscal '14. We expect about $35 million in capital spending in the June quarter, impacted by the rollover of capital from the March quarter, as well as $12.5 million and a building purchase in India to support our growing R&D operations in that location. We expect overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 to be about $80 million. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $22.4 million and was $88.4 million for fiscal 2013. I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines in the March quarter, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue grew 3.7% sequentially in the March quarter to achieve an all-time record of $275.8 million in revenue. Microcontroller revenue was also up 20.5% versus the year ago quarter. And for fiscal year '13, our microcontroller business was up 12.4% as compared to fiscal year '12. Microcontrollers represented 64.1% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. And by the way, in April, we also shipped our 12 billionth cumulative microcontroller. Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 7.7% sequentially in the March quarter, achieving a new record for revenue. 16-bit microcontroller revenue was also up 93% versus the year-ago quarter. And for fiscal year '13, our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 74% as compared to fiscal year '12. Fiscal year '13 also marks the eighth consecutive year of revenue growth and new revenue records for our 16-bit microcontroller business. We continue to expand the breadth of innovative 16-bit solutions that we are offering and customers that we are serving as we continue to gain market share in this segment. Our 32-bit microcontroller business took a pause after 3 consecutive quarters of strong double-digit growth and was down 16.6% sequentially in the March quarter, although it was up 527% over the year ago quarter. For fiscal year '13, our 32-bit business was up 475% as compared to fiscal year '12. And fiscal year '13 also marks the fourth consecutive year of revenue growth and new revenue records for our 32-bit microcontroller business. We are continuing to win new designs and expanding into new applications to enable further growth in revenue and market share. Gartner Dataquest has released their microcontroller market share report for 2012. While we remained in the #2 position for 8-bit microcontrollers, we continue to gain share versus the 8-bit market at large and versus our nearest competitors. 2 years ago, it took the combination of 3 Japanese semiconductor giants, NEC, Hitachi and Mitsubishi, to knock us off the #1 spot from 8-bit microcontrollers. We assured you at the time that we would work relentlessly to gain market share and to wrest back the #1 spot in the coming years. Over the last 2 years, we closed the gap between us and the #1 supplier, Renesas, and doubled our lead -- we closed the gap by 50%, and we doubled our lead over the #3 supplier, Atmel. And you can expect more of the same in the coming years. And unlike many of our competitors, we achieved these results while maintaining a focus on profitability. In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we were again the fastest-growing 16-bit microcontroller supplier among the top 10 suppliers in 2012. We moved up from the #8 spot in 2011 to the #7 spot in 2012. And expect continue to gain share and move up the rankings in the coming years. In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we moved from the number #17 in 2011 to the #12 spot in 2012. And once again, we were the fastest-growing major 32-bit microcontroller franchise. Now Gartner Dataquest report is a backward looking indicator, where we are performing very well. Now let's look at a forward looking indicator. Within the last month, EE Times released their results of their annual embedded market study. Once again, Microchip was rated by embedded system design engineers as their #1 choice for new designs using 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. So on all categories, we were #1. We're honored by the overwhelming preference for our solutions and see this as a positive sign for future growth, especially for our 32-bit microcontroller franchise, where there has -- where some of you have had questions about our choice of core. Our 2012 market results, as well as the 2012 design engineering preference results, echo market confirmation of our belief that what customers care about is that we offer a PIC microcontroller solution and all the attendant brand promises and that the choice of core is really not important. Moving to our analog products. Our analog business grew 4.1% sequentially in the March quarter to also achieve a new record and continues to perform exceptionally well. Analog revenue was up 12 -- 124.4% versus the year ago quarter. While for fiscal year '13, our analog business was up 89.4% as compared to fiscal year '12, easily one of the best-performing analog businesses among our peer group. Analog revenue represented 22.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter, and that's the highest proportion of our revenue ever. Moving to memory products. This business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was up 1%. While this business has had some drag on our overall growth, our memory business is becoming a smaller percentage of our overall business and was down to 7.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013, then I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2014. We were very pleased with our execution in the March quarter. In our last conference call, we told you that the December quarter was going to be our bottom quarter for this cycle, and we will see growth in the March quarter. We have more than delivered on that guidance. Our net sales were higher than the mid-point of our guidance. We managed the operating expenses extremely well, with operating expense percentage coming in 115 basis points below the mid-point and well below the low end of our guidance. All other financial metrics, like gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and non-GAAP earnings per share, all exceeded the high end of our guidance. We beat the mid-point of the guidance on earnings per share by $0.05. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip, including the new employees from SMSC, for their contribution in making this an excellent quarter. We made several new all-time records in the quarter. Our total net sales were a new record. And our total microcontroller, as well as analog net sales achieved all-time new records. Individually, 16-bit microcontrollers also achieved a new all-time record. There's no doubt that Microchip has continued to gain market share in the microcontrollers, as well as analog. I had a chance to compare Microchip's microcontroller results with the SIA data for the March 2013 that was just released. We are pleased that Microchip continued to gain market share in microcontrollers. For March 2013 quarter, our total microcontroller revenue was $275.8 million. Our overall microcontroller market share increased from 7.6% in March 2012 quarter and 8.25% in calendar year 2012, to 9.7% in the March 2013 quarter. So again, 7.6% in March of 2012 quarter. It was 8.25% in the calendar year 2012. And in the March quarter just finished, 9.7% market share. Last, but not the least, the March quarter was our 90th consecutive profitable quarter. Now we will not break the SMSC numbers out past this quarter and in the new fiscal year. But for the March quarter, the classic Microchip divisions without SMSC achieved an impressive 4.9% sequential growth. The SMSC division's net sales declined by 1.7% sequentially, mainly driven by the computing products division and the PC market weakness. While we cannot control the PC market, we would like to point out that the SMSC business delivered an impressive $0.085 accretion, which was up from $0.065 accretion in the December quarter and higher than the $0.07 to $0.08 accretion that we had guided. There are lunchtime celebrations planned tomorrow throughout the SMSC sites and the combined Microchip's SMSC integration teams for a job well done. My thanks and congratulations go out to the entire team. Now looking at the results of our fiscal year 2013, it was a record year for net sales and sales up for microcontroller, as well as analog products. In November last year, we reported that we instituted a rotating time-off program for our fab employees and substantially reduced the wafer starts in our factories to reduce inventory. The inventory has come down substantially to 116 days, well below the guidance of 123 to 129 days that we provided. We are starting to reduce the amount of the rotating time off, but not completely because the internal component of the inventory is it still a bit high, while the outsourced component of the inventory is low. We expect to end this rotating time off starting July 1. Our longer-term goal for inventory continues to be 115 to 120 days. In November, we also announced that we instituted a 5% pay cut for all executives, and we then requested other employees of the company to join the executives in a voluntary 5% pay reduction through June 30, 2013. Approximately 2,500 employees had voluntarily stepped up to take a 5% pay cut. We call it shared sacrifice. I want to thank all of the dedicated Microchip employees who volunteered for this pay cut. The participation level exemplifies the strength and uniqueness of the Microchip culture. Tomorrow in a company-wide communication meeting, I will be announcing a reduction in this pay cut from 5% to 2.5% starting the next pay cycle. And the pay cut will go to 0 on July 1. I will also be announcing a special bonus as a shared reward for the employees who made an investment in the shared sacrifice. This bonus is included in the March quarter results, and the reversal of pay cuts is included in our guidance for the June quarter and beyond. Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2014. We have continued to see exceptionally strong bookings and expedite requests in our business driven by strong demand in our design win pipeline. The bookings were an all-time record in the March quarter. The starting backlog for June quarter was significantly higher than the starting backlog for the March quarter. However, because of lead times, many new bookings will be scheduled beyond the end of this quarter. Taking all these factors into account, we expect Microchip's total net sales in the June quarter to be up between 2% and 6% sequentially. We're ramping our back-end facilities in assembly and test to meet the increased demand of our customers. Our back-end facilities have switched from lowering finished goods inventory to now rebuilding finished goods stock to reduce lead times and meet the increased demand of our customers. This switch from lowering finished goods to replenishing finished goods is causing our back-end facilities to grow their units produced by 11% sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 56.5% to 57% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 27.75% to 28.25% of sales, and we expect the operating profit to be between 28.25% to 29.25% of sales. And we expect the non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.50 and $0.54 per share. Remember that our March quarter non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 included a $0.03 credit from the recapture of past R&D credit. Therefore, a mid-point guidance of $0.52 for June quarter is $0.03 above the actual for March quarter. SMSC is now fully integrated into Microchip. But for reference, the accretion from SMSC will be about $0.09 to $0.10 for the June quarter and between $0.40 to $0.45 for fiscal year '14. This is well above the prior estimate of $0.38 to $0.42 accretion for fiscal year '14. And we have increased that estimate a couple of times before. We have already made significant progress in transforming SMSC's business model. SMSC's gross margin, operating expenses and operating profits are already significantly better than what SMSC achieved during its full fiscal year prior to the acquisition. SMSC's operating profit in the March quarter was 25.9%, well above the 12% operating profit SMSC recorded in fiscal year '12. So more than doubled. We expect that significant improvement in SMSC financial metrics will continue. Our long-term model for the combined company remains a gross margin of about 60%, plus/minus 0.5%. Operating expense of about 27.5%, plus or minus 0.5%. And operating profit of about 32.5%, plus or minus 0.5%. All of these numbers are non-GAAP. This long-term model will continue to be a premier model in the semiconductor industry and will drive substantial shareholder value. This, together with one of the highest dividends in the semiconductor industry will continue to generate excellent shareholder value. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Steve, just maybe to start, and given your vantage point in the industry and number of your customers you touch, I think you guys are in good position to answer this. And there's obviously a concern, and it's not just Microchip, it's the whole industry and really, the whole market because of the downturn that happened in the second half of the last 2 years. Because -- I guess, based on what you're seeing now, maybe you could help us by maybe comparing what you're seeing now in terms of the customer orders, the activity to the last 2 years and maybe talk about what you see different this year than perhaps over the last 2 years?
Steve Sanghi: Well, if I could refer to one report I was reading, I don't want to name the report. But I was reading an analyst report from investment analyst, where I read that for my personal investment. It said, in the last 2 years, in both years, Fed drew the stimulus out of the market right around the April timeframe. And last year, the QE2 ended and then they started it again in September or so with QE3. And the year before also, the housing and a bunch of other stimulus ended. And this report at least pointed a significant finger towards really the reduction of that stimulus, which then resulted into a weakening of the market in the second half. And actually, the GDP was already slowing down. This year, as you look at it in the U.S. market at least, the GDP is actually up from the prior quarter. It's accelerating. And there is no sign at least today of any kind of stimulus to be withdrawn. So that's not my analysis. I'm just reading the analysis from a different report. Now as we see from our own data, the bookings are very strong. They were very strong in the last quarter. We mentioned this at the last conference call also. And as we continue, finished the month of April, it was very, very strong. So currently, there is no sign that this thing will really follow the pattern it followed in the last 2 years.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay, sure. Just as a follow-up to that. Maybe you can comment a bit about -- it sounds like you're getting some longer-dated bookings now and some customers booking into the calendar third quarter. Does that imply that your own lead times are starting to expand? What's the incentive for your customers to start booking a little farther out right now?
Steve Sanghi: So you pretty much said it. So one change that has happened in the Microchip business over the years is today, 40% of our business comes from wafers made in the foundry. And this is a result of 2 acquisitions and Microchip's own strategy of really significant number of products that we are sourcing from outside. 100% of SMSC's products are bought from foundries. 100% of SST, Silicon Storage Technology products are bought from outside. And many of Microchip products over the years were, rather than adding expensive equipment inside, we have gone outside. So that change in the mix shift has really added the complexity where today, our lead times are anywhere from 2 weeks to 16 weeks depending on the product. And we make 60,000 different product types. So if you ask me, what's your lead time? There isn't really one number. It is anywhere from 2 weeks to 16 weeks-plus. There are products which are in stock, and you can take immediate delivery. And there are other products, so you will be in line if you ordered them in less than 16 weeks. So yes, we're getting orders out in time for products that have longer lead time. And anytime that happens, there is a drag effect on the other products. Even those products which are available on a much shorter term basis, customer just reads it as, those may go longer lead time also or they place a bulk order in a kit fashion for the outer months. And you tend to get bookings on all different products out in time.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Just to clarify -- was -- if I look at it versus the second half of last year, was there any meaningful change in the lead times across your portfolio from the second half of last year?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, very, very meaningful change, yes. Obviously, SMSC was acquired in the second half. It was acquired on August 2. So all that impact was since then. And many of our internal products, they have ramped significantly. They were much newer products last year, contributed much smaller portion to our volume. And 1 year later, they are in significantly high volume position.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Sumit Dhanda from ISI Group.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Just a couple of questions. The SG&A performance, you came in below the low end of expectations. Could you help us understand what exactly drove that performance?
Steve Sanghi: Go ahead.
James Eric Bjornholt: It's really just great expense control across the board. We've indicated that -- how we share information with our employee base about the state of the industry and expense control. And I'd say, all employees across the company really stepped up and helped us deliver much better performance in the operating expense area. So not much else I can share outside of that other than it was a collective effort of the entire Microchip team.
Steve Sanghi: When employees are on a pay cut and fab employees are on a rotating time off, there's a culture where everyone thinks it's their money. If you spend some money on something superfluous or just want a new computer while the old one still works, you're really spending your own money because the bonuses and pay cut reversal and RTOs and all that depend on the performance. So it's really one of the best cultures, and it creates employees to then really go out of their way in watching expenses and making it an efficient OpEx operation.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Got you. And then, just following up on the, on your commentary around lead times. How do we reconcile the fact that your own internally produced inventory is at a reasonably high level, but your lead times are still expanding? In other words, is the mix so out of kilter with how the demand requests are coming in? Or help us understand what the disconnect might be.
Steve Sanghi: So a lot of the longer lead times are not from in-house produced products. A lot of the longer lead times are from foundry products. But a lot of the in-house produced products, we were holding all the inventory in the die stores, where we have really, in the last many quarters, cut back on the production in assembly and test to not really add further value when the inventories were quite high. And as the demand has come very, very strong, we have to move that die through assembly and test. And that's where some of the challenges are in acquiring new capacity, new handlers, new testers and other stuff. And the third piece is on a good number of -- select number of products. The demand has exploded and the products are built inside, but the inventory on those new products were not very high and the demand has exploded, so we're expediting them even inside the factories.
James Eric Bjornholt: Right. So just to add on to that real quickly. I want to really emphasize the point that Steve made earlier about 40% of our products being from outside foundries. And lead times from our foundry partners have extended also. So that has compounded this. And we've taken appropriate steps to build that inventory back up in the June quarter. And you can see that in our guidance for inventory. Even though the internal inventory is coming down, the foundry product will go up and allow us to have competitive lead times.
Steve Sanghi: So the mix is not out of kilter. If the mix was out of kilter, then we would be writing off inventory because lots of products will have inventory write-downs while the other products are short. So the mix is really not out of kilter. It's -- anytime when large surge in demand happens, lots of new designs take off. And on those new designs, you couldn't predict how much customer is going to buy because they're newer designs and they were in incubation. And many of those are 32-bit microcontrollers and many of them are dsPIC and 16-bit microcontrollers. That's where the demand has exploded.
Operator: We'll go next to Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: This is Gabriela Borges on behalf of Jim. I was hoping you could give us a little detail on the puts and takes to gross margin guidance in the quarter? How should we be thinking about utilization versus last quarter given more modest inventory reductions and are there any impacts from mix shift or other factors that we should also be thinking about?
James Eric Bjornholt: So there's many factors that influence gross margin, including the mix of revenue from our various product lines, fixed cost absorption, factory loading levels, inventory reserves and just general competitive and economic conditions. So after considering those various gross margin factors for the June quarter, we're guiding non-GAAP gross margins to be up to 56.5% to 57%. As our inventory position gets rightsized, we can increase our factory output, which will help us improve our gross margins, and we will see some margin improvement from SMSC over time. So our long-term margin stays intact at 60%, plus or minus 0.5%, and we will get back to those levels as we increase utilization over time.
Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's very helpful. And then as follow-up, if I could. I was hoping you could talk about growth drivers in the 16-bit MCU portfolio given the strong result in the quarter and over the last year. How should we be thinking of the growth profile of this business going forward? And are there any particular applications you're targeting for shagging?
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh, you can take that one.
Ganesh Moorthy: There are a broad suite of applications in which we're designed in that are continuing to grow. We're getting multiple designs in these applications with these customers. It's too broad of a range to be able to pick any one item to say that's what's driving all the growth. And I think that the strength of the business is, it is not dependent on any one application or any one customer for its growth. It's pretty broad-based.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Steven Eliscu from UBS.
Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just had a question on your 32-bit PIC. I mean, we've focused a lot in the past that the fact you're not using ARM and how it could keep you out of bidding on certain deals. I'd like to turn that around and get your opinion on how when you are included on a deal, how it -- the fact that you have a microcontroller that potentially has advantages versus an ARM core. How that's resulting in what may be less competition than what some of your peers are seeing and how it could also be resulting in better pricing resiliency as we see in 32-bit pricing based on the SIA data come down significantly over the past year.
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: We never sell, based on ARM versus MIPS or everything else on the core. We're going in to customers to understand needs or identifying alternatives, and we propose solutions that are PIC microcontroller-based solutions. That includes the product, includes the development tools, includes the roadmap, includes our software, includes our support. What a customer buys is our ability to solve their needs for today and for tomorrow. And the talk of an ARM core versus a MIPS core versus some other core never comes up.
Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So you're saying you're winning because of all those attributes that you just said?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes, there are 10, 15 different attributes that are important to the customer. There may be a few for whom the core may be important, but there's a lot more for whom their success is what's important.
Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: That's helpful. And then, on the SMSC integration, a couple part question. First of all, just trying to understand why the accretion is higher than you originally expected. Is this just based on better IT integration and rationalization at the back end? Or was there more to it in terms of being able to fix some of the product groups and product areas that you didn't necessarily see upfront? And as a second part, now that also you've honed this M&A process with the last 2 acquisitions and you've essentially said the SMSC integration is complete, are you now ready sooner perhaps to do your next major acquisition?
Steve Sanghi: So the first part of your question regarding the SMSC accretion, I think we have revised these numbers up at least 2 or 3x now. Basically, the execution has been much better than any sand we had left in there. When you first make the estimates, you are largely making the estimate from looking from outside. And first estimate was actually based on the day we completed the acquisition. So as you get in there, as we got in there, we found significant more fat, a significant more areas of efficiency, where Microchip processes, business processes applied related into a significant -- more efficiencies. So the gross margin is significantly higher than we originally imagined. Operating expenses are much lower than we originally imagined. Therefore, the operating profit overall is much higher at lower revenue. So we had expected higher revenue before. So despite lower revenue, mainly because of the computing market, which has been really weak, despite the lower revenue, all other metrics have improved. And a lot of the internal metrics we have regarding revenue per employee to operating expenses, about anything to gross margins, to operating profit per employee, and various other indicators of rank of managers and VPs and directors and others, all these internal indicators are all turning green from bright red when we started. So I can't quite give you a pictorial view of that. Some of the data is confidential on it. But I have a very good chart on how -- where they indicators were, where we started and quarter-after-quarter, month-after-month, how many of these indicators have turned green.
Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And on the second part of the question?
Steve Sanghi: So the second part of your question is the SMSC acquisition is complete. Are we ready for another major acquisition? We have been ready well before even the acquisition was complete because it's different people executing it versus the people who are finding and doing the analysis. Although, if you know one that's ready and wants to do the deal, let me know, I don't have one.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar from Stephens.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Steve, I had a question on 8-bit. We're starting to hear U.S. markets, emerging markets, the end demand recovering. In your opinion, do you think it's possible for Microchip to take further share in the 8-bit market, particularly as Renesas and some of the other guys sort of flounder around in profitability?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I mean, yes, I mean, our 8-bit share is increasing rapidly. Our 8-bit share is up based on SIA data substantially over Q1 last year. It grew every quarter last year. It's up substantially over Q4. Some of the people that have broken their numbers out, including one we just heard yesterday, their 8-bit was down substantially. Sequentially, Microchip's 8-bit was up sequentially from December to March. So our 8-bit is doing very, very well. Don't think negative about 8-bit. 8-bit is resilient, doing very well, we're gaining tremendous share. It has very high gross margins. It's a tremendous contributor to profitability.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then, as again, things get better listening to your commentary, a question on CapEx. What are the puts and takes that you guys think about in deciding whether to go outside to a foundry versus going internal? Does it come down at the end to technology? Or is it a total cost proposition?
Steve Sanghi: Well, it's basically, at the end it's a cost of ownership proposition. But a couple of factors that go into that. One, we develop technologies around those business plans that are fairly large business plans, which means we will develop the mainline technologies on which we will do a lot of business. But as the company gets larger, you have a lot of small business plans. We need a little DMOS. We need a little bipolar. We need a little something else. I need a little high voltage. I need something else. So when you start to develop all these versions of technologies for all these splinter groups and small acquisitions and all those in the company, those are not cost-effective necessarily always to develop them inside. So we pretty much go find a foundry who is doing those technologies and we get those. And the second piece is, when you really go deep into lithography, where the equipment becomes very, very expensive into 12-inch wafers, then we are going predominantly outside. Microchip's both fabs are 8-inch, and they will remain 8-inch. So when we really need very deep lithography that's only available on 12-inch, we're going outside.
Operator: We'll go next to Gil Alexandre from Darphil Associates.
Gilbert Alexandre: Two questions, if I may ask. Is this BodyCom technology important or it takes a few years?
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: So BodyCom is a new innovation. We are working with a set of customers to get it adopted and implemented in production. But like most embedded solutions, they take time to be adopted, to be designed and to go to production. So don't expect an instantaneous spike in revenue from BodyCom. It will take time, but it will be like many of our solutions we brought over the years. Where we bring them to market, help customers be successful and ramp the volume.
Gilbert Alexandre: Steve, you've been very good at making economic projections. Can you give us a reading as to degree of slowdown in the Chinese economy?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I don't know if I can claim expertise on the Chinese economy. I read the same data that you read. I have a little more view from our own business standpoint or embedded control regarding what's happening. And the quarter for China was slow, driven by just the weak economy, Chinese New Year, which is always a down quarter, and the change of government, 10 year, a decade change. Every decade the government changes there, which has recently come in. Now what they are talking about are really a new round of stimulus and really trying to accelerate the economy somewhat. And when China does that, a fair amount of money often goes into the hardware goods where our products are. A lot of it goes into appliances, household appliances, TVs, automobiles and other stuff, which really has a lot of Microchip consumption. So if anything like that happens, which looks like its likely to happen, then we will be significant beneficiary.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Williams Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Can you talk about your internal utilization now? I think it's in the high 50s on the front end. Is that right? And perhaps you're more constrained in the back end. Can you comment on the differential there?
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes. We don't break out a specific capacity utilization percentage. We do have plenty of capacity in our factory to support both the short term and long-term requirements of the business. It's just quite a mix today. We talked about earlier about 40% of our business being outsourced in wafer fab. And what we're doing internally coming off the rotating time-off schedules effective July 1. So it's just a lot of moving parts. I can assure you, we have plenty of capacity to grow into internally, though.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And then there's another area of your business where I think you've done some smaller acquisitions and people -- investors, I think don't generally think of Microchip as a company with a strong position in touch and gesture and proximity controls. But I think you've developed some products there lately. Could you talk about the traction you've made there?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I mean, we have a very good touch business. We do business with over 1,000 touch customers in production, always has been. But our business characteristics is such that Microchip defends a very, very broad beachfront. We're not a touch company. We're not a motor control company. We're not a computing company. We're not a cell phone company. We participate everywhere with a very, very broad set of characteristics. So therefore, we don't really talk about any single application because there's just too many to talk about. Every once in a while, we throw something out and most people just think, hey, that's our focus. And we have a large portion of the business in that area, which is not true. The difference in touch is, with our touch, we're not pursuing cell phones and pads. Our touch is in automotive. Our touch is in industrial. Our touch is in printers, on touch screens, on various buttons and wheels and stoves and industrial equipment and household equipment. That's where our touch is. Margins are 2x higher than our competition or more. There are smaller volumes in a given design. They're support intensive, but Microchip is structured around being able to provide that. We don't go compete in a 20 million unit design in a cell phone. But we sell well over 20 million units in lots of small, small and mundane applications in the industrial and automotive and consumer world.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Christopher Danely from JPMorgan.
Shaon Baqui - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is Shaon Baqui calling in for Chris. I want to circle back real quick on a pretty well-publicized letter you guys put out, I think in the first week of February to your customers. Can you talk about what kind of impact that letter had on the order rates throughout the quarter? And maybe talk about the last time you had to issue a similar letter and what it did to order patterns?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the letter is not to create an order pattern. The letter is in response to a order pattern. So for several weeks, prior to the letter, we were getting a large amount of orders and some of the lead times had pushed out, and we talked about lead time earlier in the conversation regarding products made in foundries to some other products which are ramping very hard. So when that starts to happen, the letter is essentially giving all of our other customers a notice because Microchip has a very broad, 80,000 customers, very broad customer base. So it's to give a notice to every other customer and saying, "This is what's happening in our industry. This is what we are seeing. Please make sure that you have your orders in either at your distributor or at Microchip wherever you buy the parts from and take notice that this is happening." And usually, we didn't see any change in the pattern after that. But the pattern continued for quite a while and is continuing. It is possible that without the letter, the whole thing could have softened a little bit. And we know maybe after those customers were placing the order have placed their orders. But then when the other customers will come later on, they wouldn't have the orders in line, and they will go delinquent, their line is down. So it's a notice to the other customers, which then customer after customer then get on the bandwagon and are placing their orders which keeps the momentum rolling for an extended period of time, which is really what has happened.
Shaon Baqui - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And this is a quick follow-up along those same lines. Can you talk about where your lead times are today versus the beginning of the year and when do you plan on bringing those down?
Steve Sanghi: I don't know whether you were on the call earlier on or you just signed in. But we talked quite a bit about the lead times. Microchip's lead times are anywhere from 2 weeks to 16 weeks-plus. And there's no single number I could give you for lead time. Across the 60,000-plus products we make, the lead time is really product-dependent depending on where the product is made, whether it's made in foundry, whether it's made inside, whether we have die inventory on that product, only have to test it, or we have to start from scratch making wafers. So the lead times are all over the place. Lead times have not changed since the start of this year.
Operator: We'll go next to John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Steve, in your prepared comments, you gave us a metric that you usually don't give. I think you talked about the back end, perhaps, building units up 11% sequentially in the June quarter. Was the intent there to give us a sense of what you think underlying consumption could be, if you could meet it all? Is it expectation of future growth into September? What was the point of that data point?
Steve Sanghi: The point of that data was that in the prior quarter, we shipped more units than we built. So we were in the inventory depletion mode. And now, with the growth guidance we have given, you have to build more units. Plus, you -- I can't deplete them anymore, inventory is already low in our back end. I have to build more units to grow the inventory, plus I have to make up for the units I depleted last quarter. So it's just to give you a feel for -- ties into lead times also a little bit. We're having to grow the units 11% just to provide the growth we have guided, plus the units we depleted last year, from last quarter from the finished goods, replenish those, plus not deplete anymore and actually build some. And we have given you a range of guidance. So anytime we build, we build so that we can provide more than the middle point of the guidance.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then, Steve, on the SMSC accretion that you guys have raised a couple of times now, it sounds like a lot of that's coming on the cost side. I'm kind of curious now that we're a few quarters into this, what kind of revenue synergies you might have uncovered? And then, quickly and lastly, just given the yen situation, how do we think about yen relative to your business?
Steve Sanghi: We don't really think much about yen. We don't really buy stuff from Japan. We don't have any factories there. We ship product in Japan, but our pricing to our distributors is in dollars. So our products may become more cost-effective or less cost-effective based on yen. So if the customer has our design versus Renesas' design, they might see that difference, but most of our products that are sold in Japan are all proprietary. So it's not been a major discussion at Microchip when yen changes.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Helpful. And then on the SMSC, the accretion, what kind of revenue synergies have you guys uncovered?
Steve Sanghi: Well, quite a bit. So we're finding that SMSC's USB and Ethernet products and other common products have homes in lots and lots of Microchip sockets where we are shipping our microcontroller, serial and other products. And they were either using somebody else's Ethernet or they can add additional capability by having that connectivity. In addition, lots and lots of USB sockets, where they have large customers, many of them we did not do business with and we're finding that they need a memory or they need an analog or they need a microcontroller. And a lot of these things have design cycles and design cycle for anything these days is about 1 year, 1.5 years. So SMSC acquisition is less than 1-year old. So there is not a lot of retained revenue, although there is some, but there's a lot more coming in future.
Operator: And we'll take a follow-up from Harsh Kumar from Stephens.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Following up on that question, Steve, maybe if I remember SMSC had a pretty strong and dynamic automotive line. I know that the time to get in that kind of business is a little bit longer than most. But I was wondering if you could shed some light on how long it may take to see some benefits of cross-selling there on that particular business?
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh, you want to comment on that?
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes, I mean, I think you're right. SMSC did have a strong automotive product line and a very proprietary one at that. They also had the added advantage of influencing designs at an architectural level with the carmakers and not just working with the Tier 1s that most semiconductor companies work with, but with the Tier 1s customer, end customer who are OEMs. And in that, we're getting insight into how those platforms are evolving over time and how other Microchip solutions can be proposed and included as the early stage design of platforms are taking place. But as you noted, these are long design cycles. You won't see any of it in the next 1, 2, 3 years. It'll take time before they are done, go into production. But slowly but surely as with all of our other embedded models, these are our long-term growth initiatives.
Operator: And with no further questions in the phone queue, I would like to turn the call back to Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Well, we just want to thank all the investors and analysts for joining this call. We will see some of you on the road this quarter at some of the shows and conferences and all that. Otherwise, we will talk to you next quarter in another earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
James Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO; and Gordon Parnell, Vice President Business Development and Investor Relations. I will comment on our third quarter of fiscal year 2013 financial performance; and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Net sales into the December quarter were a record $416 million and were up 2% sequentially from non-GAAP net sales of $407.8 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Revenue by product line was $266 million for microcontrollers, $93.3 million for analog, $32.5 million for memory, $21.3 million for licensing and $2.9 million of other. Revenue by geography was $77.3 million in the Americas, $84 million in Europe and $254.7 million in Asia. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 56% in the December quarter and at the high end of our guidance provided on November 8. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 30.6% of sales and near the low end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income was 25.4% of sales and net income was $84.5 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.41 per diluted share, which is at the high end of our guidance. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 48.2% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins were negatively impacted by the sell-through of $30.8 million of written up inventory costs associated with our acquisitions. Total operating expenses were $183 million or 44% of sales, and include intangible amortization and special charges of $42.3 million and also includes share-based compensation of $12.3 million. The GAAP net income was $10.2 million. In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 15.5%, and the GAAP tax expense was impacted by the acquisition-related items and several nonrecurring events. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Our tax rate in the March quarter will be impacted by the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit that we expect will provide a benefit of about $5.6 million related to calendar 2012 and results in a non-GAAP tax rate of between 8.5% and 9%. Excluding any one-time events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 13% to 15%. To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the December quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.32, share-based compensation was about $0.056, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.018 and noncash interest expense was about $0.006. The dividend declared today of $0.353 per share will be paid on March 7, 2013, to shareholders of record on February 21, 2013. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $69 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 42nd consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. In fact, this quarter's increase marks the 36th occasion we have increased the dividend payment. And this program continues to be an important component of how we'll return value to our shareholders. Moving onto the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 31, 2013, was $261.6 million or 111 days. I want to walk you through how the inventory days calculation is impacted by the purchase accounting associated with the SMSC acquisition as it can be confusing. The accounting rules require us to first write up on acquired company's inventory to its fair value as of the acquisition date, causing a huge increase in the inventory balance. This effectively values inventory at selling price, less cost to sell. Secondly, when the inventory is sold, the inventory balance is significantly reduced with the written up inventory costs flowing through cost of goods sold. The written up inventory coming off the balance sheet and pulling through cost of goods sold in the December quarter reduced the days of inventory calculations significantly. Lastly, in the March quarter, the cost of goods sold will not reflect any significant amount of sell-through of written up inventory and the inventory balances will be clean. So the days of inventory calculation will return to a more normalized level. We expect days of inventory at the end of March to be in the 123 to 129 day range. So we are making progress in reducing the inventory balances with the action we implemented in our factories in the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors are at their all-time lowest levels of 27 days. We believe the distribution inventory will increase in the March quarter. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue recognition throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. At December 31, the consolidated accounts receivable balance was $177.5 million. Receivable balances are in great condition, with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. We had strong free cash flow generation in the December quarter of $123.2 million, prior to our dividend payment. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $1.77 billion, and we had $610 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $110 million to $130 million in the March quarter. Capital spending was approximately $9.9 million for the December quarter. We expect about $24 million in capital spending in the March quarter, as we prepare for the upturn. We expect overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 to be about $60 million. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $23 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines. Our microcontroller revenue grew 1.8% sequentially in the December quarter to achieve an all-time record of $266 million in revenue. Microcontroller revenue was also up 22.6% versus the year ago quarter. And as you will hear in Steve's remarks later, we gained market share in all microcontroller segments during 2012. Microcontrollers represented 63.9% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 12.6% sequentially in the December quarter, achieving a new record for revenue. We continue to expand the breadth of 16-bit solutions that we're offering and customers that we are serving, as we continue to gain market share in this segment. Our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 17.4% sequentially in the December quarter. We are continuing to win new designs and expanding into new applications to enable further growth in revenue and market share. Now moving to our analog products. Our analog business grew 7.7% sequentially in the December quarter to achieve a new record and continues to perform exceptionally well. Analog revenue represented 22.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter, the highest proportion of our revenue ever. During the quarter, we launched 2 new families of analog products. The first is a portfolio of high-efficiency discrete power MOSFETs, specifically tuned for power applications. The second is a family of analog power controllers that offer higher voltages and enable significant energy efficiency improvement in power conversion applications. Both product families expand our served available market for existing customers and applications, as well as enable us to penetrate new customers and applications, and nicely complement our dsPIC digital signal controllers, which already have a leadership position in the power conversion market segment. Now onto our memory business. This business is comprised of Serial EE memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, and was down 11.2% on a sequential basis. While this business has had some drive on our growth, our memory business is becoming a smaller percentage of our overall business and was down to 7.8% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Before I wrap up, a quick update on a couple of elements of the SMSC integration. All SMSC products started shipping from Microchip's operational systems on December 1, 2012, a month ahead of the plan we had last communicated to you. We have begun implementing actions to exploit our packaging and testing infrastructure in Thailand to extract operational synergies. This will, however, be a multi-quarter effort, as we systematically prioritize and execute the plans we have developed. We expect this will result in incremental EPS accretion and will be a component that drives us to our long-term business model. So to summarize, the SMSC integration is going well and we're on or ahead of our integration plans. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2013, then I will provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013. We are pleased with our execution in the December quarter, despite a very challenging macroeconomic environment. Our net sales, gross margin, operating expenses and earnings per share were all better than the mid-point of our guidance. We made new all-time record in net sales for several of our product lines. Microcontrollers, with $266 million of net sales, posted a new record. Our 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers each posted a new record in revenue. Analog products also posted a new record. Our licensing businesses also performed very well in the quarter and achieved this 6% sequential growth. Last, but not the least, the December quarter was our 89th consecutive quarter of profitability. December quarter also had several other highlights. First, our non-GAAP earnings per share at $0.41 were at the high end of our guidance. Number two, we achieved $0.065 accretion from SMSC, which was well above our guidance of $0.04 to $0.05 for December quarter. Number 3, during the quarter, we instituted a rotating time-off program for our fab employees and substantially reduced the wafer starts in our factories with reduced inventory. Because of SMSC acquisition and the write-up of SMSC inventory to market value, the inventory calculations are very complex and can be confusing. In our T.J. Rodgers [ph] of Cypress Semiconductors calls it wacky purchase accounting. I happen to agree. Eric Bjornholt went through a 3-step process on inventory after an acquisition. In step 1, the inventory is written up to the fair market value, so the inventory balloons and the inventory days go up. In the second step, the written up inventory's sold, so the inventory drops and the cost of goods sold balloon up. So the inventory days drop significantly. In December quarter, you saw this impact of step 2. In step 3, the inventory returns to normal, as the written up inventory and the higher cost of goods sold are purged from the system. The inventory days go up again because of lower cost of goods sold. So you will see that in the March quarter, when we expect the inventory days to be about 123 to 129 days. As I have said before, inventory calculations are complex after immediate acquisition. Please let me worry about the inventory. We're making significant progress in reducing Microchip inventory. Our longer-term goal for inventory continues to be 115 to 120 days. We also instituted a 5% pay cut for all executives, and then requested other employees of the company to join the executives in a voluntary 5% pay reduction through June 30, 2013. I'm happy to report that approximately 2,400 employees voluntarily stepped up to take a 5% pay cut. We call it shared sacrifice. This helped in reducing the operating expenses and avoided a broad-based layoff to cut operating expenses. This also allowed us to remain committed to our investments and will help lead to a stronger recovery for Microchip. I want to thank all the dedicated Microchip employees who volunteered for this pay cut. The participation level exemplifies the strength and uniqueness of Microchip culture. I would also like to comment on the calendar year 2012 results. I had a chance to compare Microchip's microcontroller results with the Semiconductor Industry Association data for 2012 that was just released last week. We are pleased that Microchip gained a market share in each of 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and overall microcontrollers. For calendar year 2012, our total microcontroller revenue was $997 million, which was up 3.8% from calendar year '11 revenue of $961 million. We don't break out the individual revenues by bit worth. But overall, microcontroller market share increased from 7.37% in 2011 to 8.25% in 2012. This market share in December quarter was even higher and ended up at 9.34%. There's no secret about these numbers. Our microcontroller revenue in December quarter was $266 million. And the industry microcontroller revenue, as reported by SIA, was $2.849 billion. So $266 million divided by $2.849 billion is 9.34%, which was our market share in December quarter. We expect the market share to increase further as we are guiding better than the average of the industry. Now, I will provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013. We're starting to see exceptionally strong bookings and expedite requests in our business, driven by strong demand in our design win pipeline. The backlog is starting to strengthen for this quarter and the bookings activity into the June quarter is exceptionally high. We believe that December quarter marked the bottom for this cycle for Microchip. A number of our product lines are showing significant momentum and will grow in the March quarter. We have also accounted for the effective Lunar New Year in Asia this quarter, as you have seen in numerous times before, when we are likely to see the effect of an industry recovery a quarter ahead the rest of the industry. Taking all these factors into account, we expect Microchip's total net sales in the March quarter to be up between 1% to 4% sequentially. We will maintain the rotating time off in our fabrication facilities to continue to reduce inventory. This strategy of rotating time-off worked very well in -- during 2009. It reduces factory output. But at the same time, keeps our staff employed for reduced work hours and give us the flexibility to ramp rapidly when the need arises. For the time being, we have sufficient inventory at the die inventory level that can provide surge capacity, but we will continue to evaluate the timing of any actions related to our wafer fabs. We're ramping our back-end facilities in assembly and test to meet the increased demand of our customers. Our back-end facilities have switched from lowering finished goods inventory to now rebuilding finished goods stock to maintain short lead times and meet the increased demand of our customers. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 55.75% to 56.25% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 29.25% to 30.25% of sales. And we expect the operating profit percentage to be between 25.5% to 27% of sales. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.45 and $0.49 per share, which includes about a 2.7 cents favorable impact from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. This EPS includes about $0.07 to $0.08 accretion from the acquisition of SMSC, which is up from $0.065 cents in December quarter. For the June 2013 quarter, we expect the accretion from SMSC to increase to about $0.09 to $0.10 per share, which is above the full range of accretion that we had guided on August 2, 2012, at the close of the transaction. During fiscal '14, we expect the attrition from SMSC to be between $0.38 to $0.42 per share. These numbers remain subject to the health of the underlying economy in general. So as you can see, we are progressing very well in the integration of SMSC. We are now guiding accretion to be higher than what we had originally guided for fiscal 2014. We have already made significant progress in transforming SMSC's business model, SMSC's gross margin, operating expenses and operating profits are already significantly better than what SMSC achieved during its full fiscal year prior to the acquisition. SMSC's operating profit in the December quarter was 21%, well above the 12% operating profit that SMSC reported in fiscal year '12. We expect that significant improvements in SMSC financial metrics will continue. Our long-term model for the combined company remains a gross margin of about 60%, plus/minus 0.5%; operating expenses of about 27.5%, plus or minus 0.5%; and operating profit of about 32.5%, plus or minus 0.5%. All of these numbers are non-GAAP. This long-term model will continue to be a premium model in the semiconductor industry and will drive substantial shareholder value. This, together with one of the highest dividends in the semiconductor industry, will continue to generate excellent shareholder value. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and wacky inventory write-up on acquisition, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparisons to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I'm wondering if you could give a little more color on some of the business improvement that you've seen. Where are you seeing that as a broad-based? Is it at any particular customers? And then, in particular, I was interested in the comment about the expedites that you were seeing. I don't think that's something we've seen, we've heard from your competitors. Why do you think your customers' expediting? I would assume, given the inventory levels, that the lead times are pretty low right now.
Steve Sanghi: So, Chris, thanks for the question. Basically, the inventories have run down very low at the customers, as well as at the distributors. And the customers were probably accounting for either much deeper cycle in the December or not as much recovery in this current quarter. So we are seeing a fairly strong expedite activity, which is driven by customers not having inventory and them not being able to find that inventory distribution either. The strength is pretty broad-based. We are pretty much seeing it from all geographies, including Europe. And we're seeing it in direct as well as distribution. And it doesn't seem to be any specific market segment, vertical market or anything where it's happening. We have pretty strong bookings across the board.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay, that's great. And I guess, with respect to the fab loading. You had earlier talked about running that at lower levels through the June quarter. Is that still the -- is that still the plan? Have some of the improvements you've seen caused you to change that? And perhaps you can just remind us how we should expect as that fab loading increases, we should start to see benefits on the gross margin line.
Steve Sanghi: So that's a very good question, Chris. We're asking the same question to ourselves. At this point in time, we still have inventories higher than what we would like. Total inventories and the majority of the excess inventory is sitting in the die banks. So at this current time, we are ramping our back-ending facilities to move that inventory from die bank to assembly and test into finished goods, to keep the lead time short, meet the expedite request and meet the increasing needs of the customers. We do not feel yet that we need to take any action in the fab because the die banks are quite healthy. Now as those die banks start to correct and overall inventory starts to adjust, we will be watching it on, really, a monthly basis, even more often. And the rotating time-off is very flexible. I mean, it allows us on a moment's notice to be able to increase the wafer starts by simply asking the production staff to work more hours than what they're working today. And that's the beauty of it. We don't have to hire people. We haven't laid off the people. They're all working. They simply are taking some furlough days off and they simply come to work more hours, which they would love it anyway. So as we start to make those changes, we'll communicate to the investors and analysts. Today, we're not prepared to really make any decision on it.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if we can maybe talk about the expedited orders or the increased backlog in maybe a different way. I think you talked about bookings into the June quarter as well. Can you maybe give us some kind of metrics about the longer dated order backlog into the June quarter, either in terms of how many more weeks further extended backlog that you're seeing now that compared to normal or some other kind of metrics indicating coverage?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's a more qualitative assessment we're giving you at this point in time. Clearly, as we look at how far into the quarter are we booked, at this time of the quarter, we can see we are significantly higher booked into this quarter, and we can see backlog starting to fill into the next quarter as well. I don't have a precise number to give you to say how far in that we are for next quarter.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then maybe if you could give us any kind of color on the end markets and which ones you expect to be up stronger or maybe less strongly into the March quarter, that will be helpful.
Steve Sanghi: As I earlier mentioned when Chris asked the question, I don't think we are seeing any difference by end markets nor we track them, really, as well as we would like to. Our business is largely horizontal. We serve into a lot of customers and lots of customers through distribution. So we're seeing pretty broad base strength. But some large customers where we do business directly, whether they're in the Consumer segment or Industrial segment or Automotive segment or Computing segment, we're seeing really pretty strong business bookings across the board.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just along the same lines, gross margin, you guided for flat quarter-over-quarter. Can you tell what the dynamics are there? If you said that inventory write-down was a drag on gross margins in the third quarter. Just wondering why it's not going up a little more in the fourth quarter?
James Eric Bjornholt: So, Kevin, I think maybe it's being confused. We didn't talk about an inventory write down. We talked about an inventory write-up associated with purchase accounting. And that only impacts our GAAP gross margins, which you saw were down pretty significantly at about 48%. But that does not impact the non-GAAP results. So that is not something that's impacting the quarter-over-quarter activity. Steve talked about the activities in the wafer fabs. We're remaining with these rotating time-offs schedules at this point in time and really just ramping on the back end. So that's really what's happening on the gross margin line. There isn't anything that is going to improve the gross margins in the March quarter significantly.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And also, how long did the employees agreed to take the 5% cut?
Steve Sanghi: It's through end of June.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Is there no other metrics along with that, just through June?
Steve Sanghi: Well, so it's basically voluntary in nature. So 2,400 employees voluntarily stepped up and say, we'll help the company when the operating expenses need to be brought down rather than doing a layoff. We're saving money that way. Therefore, committed to the programs, which will otherwise have to readjust or slip out. Now, if the business environment continues to strengthen, as it is looking, we'll certainly look at it again as we talk to the employees. We could reduce the 5%. We could terminate it early. All those options are there, but the number just became public today. So that conversation hasn't happened with the employees.
Operator: And we will go next to Sumit Dhanda with ISI Group.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. The analog business did exceptionally well in the quarter. So just curious, I know you've been doing well in analog for some time, but was there any specific factor that really helped drive that 8% growth, which was so much better than the rest of the industry?
Steve Sanghi: Gordon, do you want to take that one?
Gordon W. Parnell: Well, analog has been doing very well so much for many quarters, as you say. We have been able to take advantage of our analog business, not only being attached to microcontrollers, but also extending its reach into other areas of analog capability. Certainly, as we've extended into 16 and 32-bit microcontrollers, the opportunity has improved, and we've been able to take advantage of that. Our design win funnel is performing very, very well. And we're very bullish on the capabilities that we have in analog and how we've been able to grow that business.
Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Steve, maybe just as follow-up on that. If you had to take a stab at, not that we're going to hold you to this, but by how many points do you think analog business can outperform the broader analog business this year? Do you think it's 5 points more or less? Just your thought process given the design win funnel.
Steve Sanghi: Sure. You will hold me to it so I'm not going to answer it.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Well then maybe can I ask you a different question?
Steve Sanghi: Pull me to it, you will be the one.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: On the bookings, any color you can provide, Steve, on when you started to see the pickup. Was it just in January? Was it November, December? Has the bookings trajectory strengthened only lately? Or was it strengthening through the course of the fourth quarter, because the data is all over the map, depending on which company you talk to this earnings season?
Steve Sanghi: So I think it's been strengthening along. The late part of last quarter was pretty good. But around the Christmas timeframe, lots of people are off and all that. So the data gets very muddy whether you're getting higher amount of bookings in shorter number of days, because purchasing managers wouldn't be working certain days. So we cannot decide for the data as well in that timeframe. But then as we came into January, post the New Year, bookings continue to strengthen and the last several weeks have been just very, very strong.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
Andrew Paik: This is Andrew Paik calling in for John. I was just curious if you now have a better sense of normal seasonality, including SMSC. And historically, you have been a good indicator of the cycle. So I was curious what your current view is respect to the channel inventory then lead times. It seems like lead times are low, would this lead to a rather muted recovery, in your opinion?
Steve Sanghi: Well, so 2, 3 questions in there. First one was regarding the cyclicality. I don't think we have any better handle on cyclicality, in general. I think if you look at the last several years in semiconductor industry, there's just no cyclicality. I mean it's just like, things are all over the place. And if you take the average of a given quarter for 5 or 6 years, it doesn't really tell you much about where the current quarter could perform. So we could go back to a historic seasonality, where June and September are good, strong quarters. And the March is the reasonable quarter. December is usually very weak. But I'm not sure if that's good right now. March quarter is looking pretty good and December quarter, and -- I'm sorry, June quarter should strengthen further. The second part of your question was what?
Andrew Paik: Just I was curious your current view of the cycle, given that you have been a good indicator in the past. It looks like lead times are pretty low these days. And I was curious if that could possibly lead to a rather muted recovery in the near term?
Steve Sanghi: Well, when the lead times are low, it doesn't lead to a muted recovery, it leads to a strong recovery. Because when the lead times are low, the customers usually have no inventory and slight disturbance or uptick or demand drives what it is driving right now, huge expedite requests, strong bookings. Because when people can find certain parts, lead time shorts doesn't always mean 100% of the products just available today. It's usually on the majority of the products and whenever a customer needs some parts and if they don't find it for a week, the factory's down for the week, and that's very, very expensive. So usually, when the lead times are short, people don't hold any inventory and as soon as there's any sign of recovery, huge kind of orders come in, like we are seeing today. And then the recovery's actually fairly strong, I would say.
Andrew Paik: Okay. And as a quick follow-up. Just given the pay cuts through the June quarter, how should we think about the OpEx trajectory for the, I guess, post -- I guess, through June and then after the June quarter?
Steve Sanghi: So we haven't dollarized for you. I don't know if you have the number. But the March quarter is in our guidance that we're giving you. And then we can further give you guidance for past the June quarter as those pay cuts are reversed. There's also a chance that they reverse early or the pay cut is lessened from 5% or a smaller number, as I mentioned earlier, based on if we see that recovery strengthening in the June quarter, June quarter will be very strong, then we're unlikely to stay through the pay cut to the end of the June. That just wouldn't be fair to the employees at that point in time. So that's something we have to give you guidance as we go along.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Steven Eliscu from UBS.
Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Similar question on the cycle, but I want to ask it somewhat different way. Just based on your experience, strengths you're seeing this quarter. And you're already indicating further strength in the June quarter. Is there any chance that we're getting a restocking cycle that potentially holds from the June quarter, which has historically been seasonally strong? Or do you believe that we're perhaps at the front end of a multi-quarter restocking cycle? What would history tell you?
Steve Sanghi: The history tells me that not all customers, not all purchasing managers telephone each other and line up together to really go do something. And there's always a multicycle. We always see too many moving parts across a large customer base. There are customers pushing out orders, and there are many customers pulling in orders and expediting. So this usually always happens in a multicycle way -- no, multiquarter way, not in one quarter.
Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then more strategic question. Just we've seen a number of recent announcements from your competitors on low- to mid- range 32-bit controllers that are using 90-nanometer or 65-nanometer technology. And even this one competitor talked, this past week, about 300-millimeter wafer manufacturing. Is there something that -- do you believe there's something that's changed where, now, advanced process technology for low-end 32-bit is now being brought to bear? And potentially with the risk to you that some of that may squeeze your 16-bit price stack? What is your view on how to address that threat?
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, it's nothing new. There have been 32-bits at specific price points that you've been on calls where that had been brought up 4, 5 years ago. This market has many different factors upon which decisions are made. They have platform decisions, there are many competitive expectations beyond price that customers work with. And we can -- as you can see in our results, we have continued to outperform the market on our microcontrollers, on our 16-bit microcontrollers, on our 32-bit microcontrollers. As time goes on, were not standing still. We continue to evolve our product lines. We know what the competitive issues are and where they're coming from. And you will continue to see responses from us to address any competitive threats we see.
Steve Sanghi: But, Steve, how is this question different than the one for the last 15 years where Freescale will do X, Y, Z. and TI has a 300-millimeter fab and Samsung has excess capacity and they will lower the price, and blah, blah, blah, and I just rattled up some names. It's the same thing over and over. Microcontroller market is very complex. It takes thousand-plus MOSFETs from Microchip to really completely serve their market. Somebody wants low-power. Somebody high power. Somebody wants low current. Somebody wants high current. Somebody wants high-performance. Somebody wants low price. It's a very complex market and we know how to serve it very well. I mean, our 8 and 16-bit businesses did very, very well last year. Our 16-bit business was up very substantially year-over-year, and our 8-bit business gained significant share from the market as we compared to the SIA data. So everybody has their strategies. But our strategies are working very well. We gain share by bit worth and overall substantially. And as we go to the conferences, we'll show you some graphs on it. The overall market share growth went from about 7% to a little over 9% going out of the year.
Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And if I could just ask one last quick question. Last quarter, you guided for SMSC sales of $87 million to $94 million. I realized you're not reporting that going forward. But can you at least tell us what you did relative to that guidance?
Steve Sanghi: We did near the high end of that.
Operator: And we will go next to JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: I'd like to go back to the OpEx questions earlier. Hopefully, you can give us a little bit more detail on the breakdown on the savings that you saw last quarter, probably some of those salary cuts. But I'm wondering what kind of progress you're making in pulling efficiencies through from the SMSC acquisition. And what we might expect going forward. Is this sort of going to be linear improvement? And perhaps in so explaining, you might shed light on why the accretion levels have come up for you guys?
Steve Sanghi: So I think, if you've seen my commentary, we had $0.038 accretion in September quarter. We did $0.065 cents per share in December quarter. We're guiding to $0.07 to $0.08 for March. And what was it? $0.09 to $0.10 for June. So that increasing line of accretion is really a result of systems getting combined and then people becoming redundant, reducing costs, renegotiating stuff based on combined Microchip and SMSC activity, combining offices, closing down leases, those tend to be smaller items. But there is -- across the board, I mean, this is what we did with SST. We're very good at these consolidations. And it's really coming as a result of that. So SST is up -- I'm sorry, SMSC's operating expenses were well in excess of 40% when we started, and it just made 21% operating profit. And we're not breaking out the gross margin. But you can get a feel for. I told you that operating profit number, you can get a feel for how much improvement has been made. The prior year when there were standalone, the operating profits were 12% and on higher revenue. Because it was close to the downturn.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: And how much more can you pull out in terms of efficiencies? Are we near the end of that or in the middle? I guess I'm just trying to think about when those salary increases come back into play, whether it's in the September quarter or earlier?
Steve Sanghi: The salary increases are minute. They don't even make an impact of a penny.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then do we still expect to see more savings from SMSC?
Steve Sanghi: Yes.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: For the OpEx line?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, we do. Because this quarter, we're guiding to $0.07 to $0.08. And then we're seeing $0.09 to $0.10 next quarter and then $0.38 to $0.42 for fiscal year '14. So you could see we're kind of in the middle of it.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, perfect. So that's driven by the savings. And if I could just switch gears for a question on the revenue side. It seems like 16-bit and 32-bit did quite well, 8-bit less well. Can you, perhaps, explain what's going on at 8-bit side of the world? Is it the different composition of end markets perhaps or is 16 or 32 being pulled by technology upgrades? Whereas 8 needs to wait until there's more a broad, general macro recovery?
Steve Sanghi: 8-bit is more economically sensitive and it's much larger business for us than 16 and 32. So smaller businesses can outsmart, number one. Number two, there are a lot many newer products on 16 and 32. In any given segment of 16 and 32, there's much larger incremental business coming from new designs where the 8-bit is a much larger business, less number of newer products, less number of newer designs. And so when there's a macroeconomic headwind, you'll have the larger, mature business get more impacted.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.
Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: One very quick question. Unfortunately, going back to the OpEx in June. I understand the 5% pay cuts and all the rest. But do you normally see stock comp accrual and the usual annual increases in OpEx bump into June quarter because it's the first fiscal quarter of year? Or do -- will you see it in the December quarter in terms of calendar year?
James Eric Bjornholt: So really, no change in stock comp. So our stock comp program does not -- you don't see spikes in it from that standpoint.
Steve Sanghi: It's a quarterly program.
James Eric Bjornholt: Right. And if I'm kind of a normal payroll standpoint, we make changes as the business can afford them. So it's not consistently tied to a specific quarter.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Cody Acree with Williams Financial.
Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Maybe, Steve, just on a high level. The pickup that you've seen, do you believe that this is really economically based? You're gaining share. You've got excessively low inventories in the channel. I guess, can you maybe just talk about what you think is the driver, if not, from an end-market standpoint, just maybe on a high level?
Steve Sanghi: Well, it's really all of the above. You had more of the answer to the question than the question itself. The addition of all those and we cannot decipher. It's the -- there is some recovery in the works. So there's very low inventories. So there is resurgence coming out of that. We're gaining share. Lots of new products, new design wins that have been in the incubation and, usually, customers don't launch their new products in a very bad environment. And I think the last new products are getting launched and we're getting customer schedules for products going into a lot of new products and the structure and bookings coming from there, where customers relaunch their new products. So it's a combination of all that.
Operator: And we will take our last question from Raji Gill with Needham & Company.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Sorry, if this was asked before, but I jumped on late. With respect to kind of the trends in the microcontroller market, it appears that some of your competitors are starting to integrate low-power Wi-Fi into the microcontroller and starting to go out to the Internet of things. I'm just wondering if you have thoughts on that particular market or that particular strategy.
Steve Sanghi: Well, the competitor you're mentioning is behind because it -- they're just starting to hear about it now and we've been doing it about, what? Several years?
James Eric Bjornholt: 2,4 years. And you can go back and look at as we did acquisitions along the way, we had GE as the first acquisition that brought us into the Internet of thing space between that. The microcontrollers, the software that's required -- and this is a pretty fragmented market, where it takes more than just a product. It takes a significant amount of other collateral to enable small, medium-sized customers to be able to get into this. So we've been at it for some time.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: No, I know you're ahead. I'm just wondering if you -- how do you kind of look at the market in terms of the size and the future of it going forward.
Ganesh Moorthy: Is a good market. It's growing. It's not going to be like a cellphone market. It's going to take time to build across a broad slate of customers and applications. And in that sense, I think it'll be a nice, good sustainable business over the long term.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: And just last question on the automotive side. Can you describe some of the cross-selling opportunities that you're kind of seeing now with SMSC and how do you think that kind of positions you to gain share in 32-bit market relative to, say, Freescale or Renesas and just wondering what your thoughts on the ARM-based controller versus kind of MIPS-based controller in that market.
James Eric Bjornholt: Again, we have never thought in terms of ARM versus MIPS and that's really not what the solution that customer buys. So customers are looking for infotainment solutions, which is what came to us through the SMSC acquisitions. Customers are looking for analog and other memory microcontroller kind of solutions to go into the applications they have. The opportunity with SMSC has given us deeper relationships in certain accounts, where they had a much larger position than we did. There's certainly deeper relationships that the SMSC Automotive business had with the automotive OEMs giving us more insight into where platforms are being -- what direction people are taking and what some of the future technology requirements are. I wouldn't say there's any immediate change that has happened in revenue. Things take a long time in automotive. But we're getting substantial insight on where the future of automotive platforms, from an electronics standpoint, are going. And where there are opportunities to potentially work with the combined portfolio of products at customers where either one of us were not having as high of a content.
Steve Sanghi: There is cross-selling synergy coming out on a more shorter-term basis, but it's not in the automotive market because it takes longer. We're seeing it in other industrial and consumer end of the markets, like set-top boxes and various USB hubs and computing segment and docks and speaker docks and all that kind stuff, digital audio and other things. So there are plenty of markets where we are seeing attach opportunities with either microcontrollers or analog products. We're also seeing those opportunities in automotive. But automotive will be longer time to market because they will have to be designed in.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back over to the presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: We want to thank everyone for attending today. We'll be at the Morgan Stanley conference on February 27 in San Francisco. And we'll see some of you there. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Second Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
James Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, who is joining us from business travel in New York today; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO, who is joining us from business travel in India today; and Gordon Parnell Vice President, Business Development and Investor Relations. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2013 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales on the September quarter were a record $407.8 million, including $72.5 million of non-GAAP net sales from SMSC, and were up sequentially 15.7% from net sales of $352.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $24.5 million higher than GAAP net sales, as GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs. On a non-GAAP basis, revenue by product line was $261.3 million for microcontrollers, $86.6 million for analog, $36.6 million for memory, $20.1 million for licensing and $3.2 million of other. Revenue by geography was $81.8 million in the Americas, $85.6 million in Europe and $240.4 million in Asia. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.7% in the September quarter and non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.5% of sales. Non-GAAP operating income was 29.2% of sales, and net income was $97.7 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.48 per diluted share, $0.038 of which related to SMSC's operating results. On a full GAAP basis, net sales were a record $383.3 million, and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 50.7% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins were negatively impacted by the sell-through of $22.7 million of written up inventory costs associated with our acquisitions. Total operating expenses were $186.1 million or 48.6% of sales and include share-based compensation of $17.9 million, acquisition-related expenses of $40.6 million and a special charge of $11.5 million related to legal matters that were settled associated with Silicon Storage Technology that we acquired in April 2010. The GAAP net loss was $21.2 million or $0.11 per diluted share and was impacted by $29.7 million of nonrecurring tax charges associated with our acquisition of SMSC. In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 15.1%, and the GAAP tax expense was impacted by the onetime charge I mentioned above. The non-GAAP tax expense in the September quarter was negatively impacted by $2.4 million of SMSC tax matters and will continue in future quarters -- or tax that will not continue in future quarters, excuse me. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Once SMSC is fully integrated into our business systems and operating structure, we expect our forward-looking effective tax rate to be about 13% to 15%. And I'll remind you that this is without any benefit from the R&D tax credit, which has currently expired and has not yet been reinstated. To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the September quarter, share-based compensation was about $0.083, acquisition-related items were about $0.323, the special charge related to the legal settlements was about $0.021, noncash interest expense was about $0.006 and the onetime tax charge was about $0.145. The dividend declared today of $0.352 per share will be paid on December 6, 2012 to shareholders of record on November 21, 2012. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $68.5 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 41st consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend, and this program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at September 30, 2012 was $289.5 million or 140 days, up 3 days from the prior quarter levels. The inventory balance at September 30, 2012 includes $26.2 million of SMSC inventory write-up costs required for purchase accounting. Inventory at our distributors continue be at historically low levels at 31 days. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. At September 30, the consolidated accounts receivable balance was $230.5 million. Receivable balances are in great condition, with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was approximately $1.71 billion, and we had $600 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $80 million to $100 million in the December quarter. Capital spending was approximately $15.9 million for the September quarter, including SMSC capital spending. We expect about $15 million in capital spending this quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2013 to be about $50 million. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $22.3 million, also including SMSC. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines, and let's start with microcontrollers. Our stand-alone microcontroller revenue, without SMSC, was $227.4 million in the September quarter, down 5.5% sequentially, but slightly positive as compared to the year-ago quarter. As we explained in our last conference call, Microchip classified SMSC revenue into microcontrollers and analog products. Based on the partial quarter, from August 2 to September 30, SMSC's total non-GAAP revenue was $72.5 million. 46.8% of this revenue or roughly $33.9 million was microcontroller revenue, and 53.2% or roughly $38.5 million was analog revenue. For the rest of my prepared remarks, I shall be using non-GAAP revenue in all of my commentary. Combining the $33.9 million of microcontroller revenue from SMSC with Microchip's historical microcontroller revenue, Microchip's total microcontroller revenue for the quarter was $261.3 million, an all-time record. Our standalone 16-bit microcontroller business was down 7.8% sequentially and up 28.8% from the year-ago quarter. Coming on the heels of several strong growth quarters and the achievement of record revenue in the June quarter, the softness seen in the September quarter is reflective of the weak macro environment. Combining the 16-bit microcontroller revenue from SMSC with Microchip's historical 16-bit microcontroller revenue, this business achievement an all-time record for revenue in the September quarter. Our stand-alone 32-bit microcontroller business was down 0.5% sequentially after being up a whopping 71.5% sequentially in the June quarter, which was a record. This business was also up 97% from the year-ago quarter, demonstrating continuing strong share gains. Combining the 32-bit microcontroller revenue from SMSC with Microchip's historical 32-bit microcontroller revenue, this business also achieved an all-time record for revenue in the September quarter. Moving to development tools. We shipped almost 47,000 tools in the September quarter. Cumulatively, we have now shipped close to 1.39 million development tools, and development tools sales remained an excellent leading indicator of continued strong design-in activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers. Now let's move to our analog business. Microchip's stand-alone analog business, without SMSC, bucked the trend and grew 1.9% sequentially to achieve a new record and performed exceptionally well in the current environment. Our analog business was also up 13.7% as compared to the year-ago quarter. The innovative new products we've been introducing for a while now are fueling the above-average growth of our analog business, and we have more new innovative products in our development pipeline that will be coming soon. As an example, next week, we will be launching 2 new products -- 2 new families of analog products. The first is a portfolio of high-efficiency discrete power MOSFETs, specifically tuned for power applications. The second is a family of analog power controllers that offer higher voltages and deliver excellent power conversion efficiencies. Both product families expand our served available markets for existing customers and applications, as well as enable us to penetrate new customers and applications and nicely complement our dsPIC digital signal controllers, which already have a leadership position in the power conversion market segment. Combining the analog revenue from SMSC with Microchip's historical analog revenue, our analog business in the September quarter represented 21.2% of Microchip's business, almost 3x the proportion of Microchip's business that analog was just a few years ago. Moving now to the memory products. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was down 10.2% on a sequential basis. While this business has had some drag on our growth as we avoid chasing the profitless posterity of growth with no profit, our memory business is becoming a smaller percentage of our overall business and was down to 9% of our combined revenue in the September quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customer to complete their solutions. Before I wrap up, a quick update on how the SMSC integration is progressing. The effort to combine the operational and business systems of both companies is always a massive post-closing effort. As a follow-up to the plan we outlined at our August conference call, I'm happy to report that all SMSC products are on track to ship from Microchip's operational system no later than January 1, 2013, and all business systems are on track to converge by the first calendar quarter of 2013. We have also identified several areas of operational synergies that can exploit our assembly and test infrastructure in Thailand. We've also gone through our combined supply chains and identified a number of opportunities where we can harness the best cost that either company has, as well as the opportunity to leverage our combined volume for lower cost. These opportunities are being actively worked to realize the savings that they represent. The SMSC business divisions are also well into the integration process. We have already identified a number of synergy opportunities in the area of IP acquisition and development, CAD infrastructure, reference design, joint marketing and joint development. In the coming months, we expect to find many more synergy opportunities. On the sales front, we continue to maintain a separate focus on the different product lines to ensure customer focus and continuity. In the meanwhile, the sales teams are working together to cross-train and enable more cross-selling opportunities as time goes on. We have also combined the distribution networks of both companies and, in the process, franchised Arrow, who only had SMSC products, to also sell Microchip products, as well as franchised Future Electronics, who only had Microchip products, to also sell SMSC products. With these changes, all 3 global distributors, Avnet, Arrow and Future Electronics, are franchised for our complete product line on a global basis. This now makes Microchip the only supplier of microcontrollers and analog that has franchised the 3 largest global distributors on a worldwide basis. We're also well into the process of franchising our 80-plus regional distributors in Europe and Asia on the SMSC product lines, which will further add to the sales reach for these products. Last but not least, we have expended considerable time and energy in many Microchip managers to guide SMSC employees in matters related to our unique culture and guiding values and to be personally visible during the integration process at the different SMSC locations, so that everyone understands the goal and is pulling in one direction. We are thankful to the extra effort invested by many Microchip employees to execute and support the integration and proud of the SMSC employees who are embracing our culture and unleashing their full potential towards the business of the combined companies. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2013, then I will provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2013. Our September quarter results were slightly lower than what we had guided during the last earnings call and consistent with the preliminary results we announced on October 15. The shortfall was entirely attributable to the macro environment, which was very weak. The negative effects of Europe and weaker economic activity in the U.S. and China led us to finish the quarter slightly lower than the range of guidance for net sales and earnings per share. Our consolidated results, including SMSC, had several major highlights. First, our microcontroller business achieved an all-time record at $261.3 million revenue. Our analog business also reached a new record at $86.6 million revenue. Our analog business now represents 21.2% of our total sales. Our total business made a new record at $407.8 million revenue and, for the first time, caused a $1.6 billion run rate. Last but not the least, on a non-GAAP basis, the September quarter was our 88th consecutive quarter of profitability. Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2013. We are continuing to see very weak macroeconomic environment in the U.S., Europe, Asia and China. We believe that the world of GDP growth is decelerating. We are seeing weakness in SMSC business, as well as Microchip's microcontroller, analog and memory businesses. However, the December quarter will have 3 months of SMSC business versus 2 months last quarter, which is expected to take our net sales to a new record high at the midpoint of our guidance. We expect Microchip's total net sales, including SMSC, to be $396 million to $426 million. This includes approximately $87 million to $94 million of SMSC net sales. Given the continuing weak macroeconomic environment, we are no longer comfortable with the high inventory level we have in our business. Therefore, we have decided to cut the wafer starts in our fab. We are putting the fab personnel on a rotating time-off schedule. This was the same technique that we deployed in early 2009, and it worked very well at that time. It reduces factory output, but, at the same time, keeps the staff employed for reduced work hours and gives us the flexibility to ramp rapidly should the need arise. This will have a negative impact of about 200 basis points on the gross margin from the September quarter. We expect to be on this rotating time-off through the end of June 2013. We expect the inventory to be corrected by then and, with some recovery in the business, we expect to start normalizing the production wafer starts and the employee work hours. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our consolidated gross margins to be between 55.5% to 56% of sales; we expect operating expenses to be between 30.5% to 31% of sales; and we expect operating profit percentage to be between 24.5% to 25.5 percentage of sales; and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.37 to $0.41 per share. This EPS includes about $0.04 to $0.05 accretion from the acquisition of SMSC. In the August conference call, we had guided December quarter accretion from SMSC to be $0.06 to $0.07. The difference is all related to the business downturn and lower sales projection toward the December quarter. For the March 2013 quarter, we expect the accretion from SMSC to increase to about $0.05 to $0.06 per share, and for the June 2013 quarter, we expect the accretion to be $0.06 to $0.07 per share. For fiscal year '14, we expect to be in the full range of accretion of about $0.08 to $0.09 per share per quarter by the end of fiscal year. These numbers remain subject to the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy, in general. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisition, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisition, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. As you very well know, Microchip has maintained the premium financial model for gross margin, operating expenses and operating profit for a very long time. Every time we do an acquisition where the target's operating business model is not at par with Microchip, there is substantial speculation regarding what the acquisition will do to Microchip's combined business model. Our track record has shown that Microchip has been able to improve the business model of its acquisition, and our combined business model has remained virtually unchanged. In the case of SMSC, we are implementing substantial business process improvements to improve gross margin percentage, lower operating expenses and substantially increase its operating profit. Our long-term model for the combined company remains a gross margin of about 60%, plus/minus 0.5%; operating expenses of about 27.5%, plus/minus 0.5%; and operating profit of 32.5%, plus/minus 0.5%. All of these numbers are non-GAAP. This long-term model will continue to be a premium model in the semiconductor industry and will drive substantial shareholder value. This, together with one of the highest dividends in the semiconductor industry, will continue to generate excellent shareholder value. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Just to start, if you can comment a little bit about what you're seeing with the macro conditions. I think what you guys are talking about is not too far different than what we're seeing from others. I guess, to what extent is this -- your customers taking down inventory levels further? To what extent is it just demand hitting a new lower level, in your opinion?
Steve Sanghi: The distributors have taken down inventory and, as Eric pointed out, the distribution inventory is a decade low. As far as the customers are concerned, there is -- there's really a demand shortage. Any time the demand falls, then any inventory customers have becomes more based on their run rate. So there is always an element of inventory correction to that lower demand number. But the predominant issue is really the macro weakness where we have record number of design wins, lots and lots of new customers going to production. If you look at total number of designs we're shipping into any given customer is increasing, but they're all taking less dollar amount and less unit amount per design, which is not a whole different commentary than we have seen with many other competitors. That's sort of what we are seeing.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And as a follow-up, and I think you commented on this last quarter with respect to what the seasonality of the business looks like as we incorporate SMSC, but wondering if you could talk about that again, given you have a little more time under your belt and maybe a little better feeling for the SMSC business in terms of seasonality.
Steve Sanghi: Well, we don't really have that much more to comment. The thing is we have changed the SMSC's calendar to a Microchip fiscal calendar. Their quarters ended on May and August and November. So if you look at a quarter like December and then March, in their February ending quarter, they would pick up December, which will usually be weak, and then pick up the Chinese New Year. And on Microchip calendar, Thanksgiving and December fall in one quarter and the Chinese New Year falls in another quarter. So there are a lot of moving parts. In parallel with all that, with commentary you're seeing from all the PC guys and others, there's a substantial demand contraction in the business, along with the inventory correction. So with so many moving parts, I don't think we're ready to establish a new seasonality. I think I would actually say that there is no pattern of seasonality anymore in the business. It's just whatever happens. If you look at a lot of different companies and you simply try to predict a quarter based on its seasonality for the last 5 years, you don't get a good meaningful result. We will have a better feeling about a year after we have run SMSC on our clock, and some of our seasonality might change. But even if you look at our own business, we hardly ever have weak September. September usually is a fairly strong quarter for us, and we have just experienced a very weak September. So I think the old seasonality models are really out the window.
Operator: We'll go next to Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak + Co.
Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: If I look at the $24 million, the difference between GAAP, non-GAAP revenue in the September quarter, is there any way you can just give us a rough breakdown of what that is between the MCU and analog?
Steve Sanghi: Eric, I don't know if you have broken that out.
James Eric Bjornholt: I don't think that's something that we're ready to share here in terms of breakdown of analog and microcontroller. But the issue there, Brendan, it's just any inventory that's sitting in the distribution channel on the date of the acquisition, we don't get to recognize the sell-through for that. So that's something that we can follow up on, but I don't have a number for you in terms of the micro-analog split unless Gordon has something he'd want to share.
Gordon W. Parnell: No, I don't have that available.
Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Okay, I'll follow up with you guys after the call. The -- I mean, I guess, looking at the utilization inventory correction part of the thing that you're talking about through the June quarter, and typically, Steve has a good kind of take on the overall semiconductor cycle, are we looking at basically things being pretty tough going here through the June quarter? Or when -- what do you think -- are we going to bottom in the March quarter? Or what's your take on it? You generally have some sort of outlook on that.
Steve Sanghi: Well, let me take a crack at it. Basically, I think, along with you guys, us and everybody else is concerned about the fiscal cliff. It's having negative impact on the business now, and it will continue to have the business into probably the first quarter. Nobody knows whether fiscal cliff is going to get resolved. If it does get resolved, then it takes a while for it to get into the system. Meanwhile, lots of -- lots and lots of our small customers are strapped with credit and living hand to mouth and not launching their products and taking lower revenue and seeing economic contraction, and all those things are continuing. There is a big power change going on in China with the new President and the new Premier coming in. Nobody knows the impact of that. Usually, most people say that, that will have a positive effect, but, again, it takes some time for it to incur. So there are a lot of cross currents. When I mentioned through the June of next year, it's just cutting wafer starts for about a 7.5-month period, which we think will correct the inventory to a point where I will feel comfortable. A growth in the business between now and then will actually accelerate it, bring the inventory down and the action manned [ph] earlier. So it's more driven by the wafer starts, how long we need to correct the inventory than is a commentary on whether I expect the business to be not good through June.
Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Okay. If I could have just a very quick follow-up on that on the gross margin side because you're cutting wafer starts. You're going to keep these wafer starts low for 7 months, so we could expect these gross margins to stay at current low levels or the same period or hit bottom in the December quarter and tick up a little bit?
Steve Sanghi: No, I think they will stay at that level, and it will modulate based on -- if we see any revenue growth or strength in business or distributors start building inventory and then if we modulate these wafer start cuts, we're cutting at a certain level. If we cut less, then the margin will improve. So if we don't cut, then -- if we cut and keep it at the same level, then the margin will stay in this range through the June.
Operator: We'll go next to James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could comment on the end market behavior you're seeing going into Q4. I mean, clearly, things are weaker across the board, but any notable pockets of weakness outside of PCs or any pockets that you think did relatively better?
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh, do you have any comment to make on that?
Ganesh Moorthy: Clearly, the markets that are in -- related to PC, consumer electronics, as they go through the December quarter, are the ones that tend to have a market change that is associated with the December quarter. So those are the markets, I would say, that are performing or behaving like they are. Some of the other ones which are the industrial markets, et cetera, are not quite as pronounced as that. So there are small changes, but at the end, most of our business tends to have -- it's a large base of customers. We have new customers, new applications that are also in the mix, and we don't see as much of a company-wide effect that you can decode down to end markets in any given quarter.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then as a follow-up on the earlier question on the factory loadings, I just want to clarify. It sounds like you're saying that if business conditions don't get any worse, you want to keep these loadings at this level until roughly the June quarter, and that should be enough to bring the inventories down. Is that correct? And any other thoughts around what would prompt you to bring the factory loadings up earlier than that point?
Steve Sanghi: Well, there are always a large number of moving parts. So business conditions don't improve, but distribution thinks the inventory has gone too low. 31 days is really extremely low, a decade low. And if the distribution builds back some of the inventory, getting prepared for the any upturn or improvement in business condition, then that would be a positive. There's a large amount of mix across memory, analog, microcontroller products, and you can always have the mix change, which could drive that you have to build certain number of products. And some different products will take a little longer to bleed out. So there are a lot of moving parts, but I think that's the general thing.
Operator: We'll go next to Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So the first question is in regard to the Japanese market. Obviously, a lot of the Japanese analog and microcontroller suppliers are having difficulty, given the tough times internally in the Japanese market and given currency. I want to just to understand how competitively you've seen their behavior change given some of the distress that they're facing.
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's not something that has just happened. For a while now, the larger semiconductor companies in Japan have been trying to figure out how to restructure. Some have been at restructuring now for 7, 8 years and really have made progress very, very slowly. But as they go through their troubles, we find more opportunities where customers are uncomfortable with their supply. Whoever they have in their supply base are increasingly inviting us to be part of that base, and I don't think it is a very quick transition. But I think, over the long run, there are more opportunities for Microchip, both in Japan, but also outside of Japan, where these same companies sell their products, where Microchip should be able to find more homes and more served markets that we can go after.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up question, this one regarding SMSC and the computing market; as we look to the transition toward Haswell in mid-'13, what do you see in terms of opportunities, perhaps, for you in that business?
Steve Sanghi: So SMSC is very well-positioned for the Haswell architecture because Intel has chosen SMSC as the partner for providing the embedded controller for Haswell. One of the main thing Haswell architecture brings is a term called standby connectivity. Today, you lose the conductivity when you close your PC, and the Haswell architecture will provide very low power, significant savings in power. And you could have it on a standby and still you're connected, getting e-mails, getting stuff, things downloaded and all that stuff. So it requires very, very low power, and we're the partner. So I think the content goes up when Haswell is in volume production. Does that answer your question?
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: It did.
Operator: We'll go next to JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: Just had a question about the guidance, and I may have missed this. But did you break down for us the non-GAAP versus GAAP revenue guidance? And if not, could you please or could you give us some sense of how much is left in distribution that you will not be able to put in your revenues over time?
James Eric Bjornholt: Steve, I'll take that. So JoAnne, there's no difference in GAAP and non-GAAP revenue in the December quarter. So all the inventory that was in the SMSC distribution channel essentially flushed through during the September quarter. So that we do have in our guidance table on the press release GAAP and non-GAAP guidance, and on revenue line, they're the same.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, all right. I appreciate the reminder. Okay. And then just on the pace of orders. We've been hearing different patterns on the Microchip side or microcontroller side of analog. Could you give us some detail about what you've seen so far early here in the December quarter for the order pattern on both those sides of your businesses?
Steve Sanghi: The order patterns in the business continue to be weak, consistent with what we have guided, and I don't believe there is any noticeable difference on analog versus microcontrollers.
Operator: We'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Just a quick question on December gross margins, Eric. Is there -- is it all rotating time off that's affecting the gross margin number as such? Or are there other things that are built in? Will you just clarify for us?
Steve Sanghi: So, Eric, let me comment, then you can add to it. So I think there are 2 factors. The biggest impact is coming out of cutting wafer starts. The rotating time off is just one way of managing the wafer start cut. The gross margin decline is not coming out of rotating time off. It's coming out of lower utilization by cutting the wafer start. Some people lay off the people to really then manage reduced activity. Instead of laying off, we give everybody a shared sacrifice cut so you have the people employed, trained, working on new processes, ready to increase their hours when we need it. So very quickly increase the activity when we need it. So just a clarification that the gross margin impact is coming out of starts cut, not the rotating time off. Rotating time off is just one way of managing reduced hours -- work hours. But there's also a second impact on gross margin, which is coming out of SMSC revenue being 3 months now versus 2 months last quarter. Please add something if you need to add.
James Eric Bjornholt: No covered it, Steve. That's good.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: And as a follow-up, if I can ask, guys, is most of the OpEx cuts at SMSC that were supposed to happen, are you guys done with most of that? Or is some of it still left? Just any kind of update you want to give us?
Steve Sanghi: So it's not all done. As Ganesh pointed out, the -- all the products are supposed to ship from Microchip's IT and business systems by January 1. So it's really not all completed yet. The lowest-hanging fruit early on has been done, but there's some more hard work ahead.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Steven Eliscu with UBS.
Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: The first question regarding the new added distributors for parts of your business with Arrow and Future. With the additional-- when you added Memec and focused that effort on generating additional design win growth, clearly, you learned something in terms of how that benefited your business. And given the material addition in terms of just the apps people on the street, how do you -- do you expect a material increase with this edition in terms of demand creation and future growth?
Steve Sanghi: Well, yes, we see a meaningful difference in the number of design wins and the registrations and all that created. But it's a very design win-driven business, and the incubation period for design wins is 9 months on the earliest to up to 2 years. So you could get a little bit of revenue here and there from jumper balls, but -- and some on the analog products and some on the commodity memory products. But real design win revenue is a little out in time because there's incubation periods.
Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. So I guess just as a follow-up to that. You're saying that there will be a delayed effect, but based on what you learned from the demand creation from Memec, you do expect some material increase in demand creation from adding Arrow and Future to the respective parts of the business.
Steve Sanghi: Yes, I do. But, Eric, roughly, what portion of our business are global distributors?
James Eric Bjornholt: Steve, it's probably -- we'd have to look at a full run rate for SMSC, but it's definitely less than 20% of the overall business. It's probably closer to 15%.
Steve Sanghi: Yes. So as we have described many, many times before, we have 80-plus regional distributors, which are strong demand creators in the largest geography we have in Asia and also lots of them in Europe. Global distributors are good contributors, but all of them combined are in that range. So it's a positive thing to really add and extend the channel. It's a very positive thing for SMSC to have Microchip's largest distributor, which is Future Electronics, to be engaged in selling and creating designs for SMSC products also. So I'm not taking it away, but I'm just -- I don't know what your model will say in tempering the enthusiasm.
Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Sure. No, I understood. That's very helpful. And just a different question on your experience with SMSC; based on what you just said. It sounds like you're finding lots of opportunities for cost synergies as you really get into business. I guess, what I'm curious about is just with SMSC being on the other side of the country, how that -- how you've been able to deal with that. If that has ended up making the logistics more difficult than maybe you expected. And if you would be more cautious about future acquisitions, that were so far away from your home base.
Steve Sanghi: No, I mean I'm stuck in New York in 32 degrees. I'd rather be in Phoenix at 88. So with that said, we have broad management team. Myself and Ganesh and Gordon and others have been taking turns, and it's really tag teaming. SMSC was absolutely with a great analysis on it. We understood it well. We're executing it very well. We haven't found any major problems that we had not anticipated. The entire integration is going very well. It will turn out to be absolutely the right thing to do and very, very good acquisition. We probably would have beaten our numbers for accretion and all that and how well after being added for a while with the products and all that we see. Unfortunately, we had not counted on the strong downturn in the business environment 2 months after acquiring the company that you have seen from every other semiconductor company; it's not an SMSC-specific problem. If this environment had waited another 9 months, had given us through June or September of next year, we would have produced outstanding results. Just you would have been proud of them. And we still will. But now it will take longer because short term, all the improvements we are making on gross margin and OpEx cut and business model improvements, finding the synergy, are all being overshadowed by the business environment and the drop in the revenue because you can't get your way out of it. So that's why we have lowered the December accretion from $0.06 to $0.07 we had to now a number, I don't want to be wrong on it, Gordon. Is it $0.05 to $0.06 or $0.04 to $0.05?
Gordon W. Parnell: $0.05.
Steve Sanghi: Yes, $0.04 to $0.05 now versus what we had guided before. And to what we had guided before, we had upside. So that is the unfortunate thing, which is nothing to do with SMSC, it just has to do with the environment. But beyond that, New York is not the only place they are in. They have a large center in Austin. They have people in Irvine. They have people in San Jose. There's a center in Germany. And Microchip has people in all those places also. So management team is spread out. That's what we have to be able to do. It's a global company. Ganesh, actually, is attending this call from India in Bangalore where Microchip has 200 people and SMSC has about 80 people who are moving into our facility at the end of December. And I'm here in New York. I was yesterday at the SMSC headquarters. So no, that will not change our desire to do these global acquisitions in the future. There is absolutely no issue related to that. It's working very well. It's the environment that has taken some wind out.
Operator: We'll go next to Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: I echo the earlier sentiment on the clear transparency in terms of how SMSC impacted your business. The first question is a follow-up to the prior discussion, Steve. As you look at the SMSC business, as it's coming in, it looks like the accretion targets are about $0.02 lower in the December through the June quarters versus prior, and you've been clear that that's a revenue impact. But is there -- is the revenue impact that you're seeing there in any one particular part of the SMSC business or parts of that business? Or is it just equally broad-based across all their businesses?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I don't know if it's equal. Nothing ever happens equally in our business also. But it's broadly distributed. There are 4 divisions we are running in SMSC: One is the automotive; other is the computing; third is the USB and Ethernet; and fourth is the wireless audio. And there is downturn in all those 4 businesses, not dissimilar to Microchip where we are seeing downturn in our analog, microcontroller, memory, all businesses.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: And then as a follow-up, it looks like the new capital expenditure expectation for this fiscal year is about $10 million lower than what you communicated 3 months ago. Can you help us understand where it is that you're able to be a little bit more efficient with your capital spend?
Steve Sanghi: Basically, when the business is not growing, you usually have enough capital. So the capacity capital incrementally really goes to 0, and then you have here and there bottlenecks, new technology or some new things that you have to invest in. But driven by the lower revenue guidance, you're able to take some capital out. The reduction actually is more than $10 million because the older number was Microchip alone. This is now includes SMSC, and they had a capital budget.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Can you say how much you're planning to spend for the SMSC and the Microchip parts of the businesses this year?
Steve Sanghi: We really have not broken it out. And as the synergies identified, if there is some capital needed to transfer something to Microchip factories at a lower cost, I am more than willing to spend that money, if the cost is lower, but otherwise, also if the capital has been constrained. So these are being identified as we go. There's not a lot of it between now and end of the quarter because a lot of those programs are being identified and all that, and capital takes a little while to buy and make it productive.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Is there a time for a question to Eric?
James Eric Bjornholt: Sure.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: The companies effectively go into a shared sacrifice program in manufacturing to get output to the right level to rebalance inventory. As you look at the weak environment that we're in, Microchip has historically been very strong at operating expense management. How do you think about operating expense levels given the uncertain backdrop and what sounds like uncertainty on the part of the management team over the next 2 to 3 quarters? Is there an opportunity to take OpEx lower? And if so, what could be the triggers to do that?
James Eric Bjornholt: Well, Craig, I mean, we've got a variable compensation system at Microchip and we've used that historically to manage through these difficult times. So with that, we look at those things. We have worldwide communication meetings where we talk about spending and how to act like this money is your own and employees latch on to that. So we get the whole employee population involved in the process. And just as in prior downturns, we will do an excellent job of managing expenses this go around.
Steve Sanghi: We want you to know that starting Monday, my management team already knows that our management team, our weekly director, corporate fellows, they're all on a 5% pay cut starting Monday. So Microchip leadership team steps up first to make the sacrifice when we're asking anybody else to do anything. Earnings are down substantially. Operating expenses have popped up, driven by lower revenues, so the entire management team. And it's been a voluntary program, and pretty much, everybody will step up.
Operator: We'll go next to John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Steve, I apologize if I missed this, but did you throw out kind of either on an absolute dollar basis or days basis kind of what target inventory levels you're looking to get to by June? And if by the off chance, end demand surprise on the upside, can you just remind me cycle time through the fab and how quickly the fab network could respond?
Steve Sanghi: Well, no, I didn't throw out any number. I never want to be limited to pin down to any number. It's a complex business where it depends on how much inventory's in distribution. If inventory in distribution goes to 40, then I'm comfortable with one set of number. If it's 31, I'm comfortable with another set of number. So no, I have not thrown any number out. What I think historically we have talked about, if the distribution inventory was average, which clearly it is not, if it was average, then we are comfortable in the 115 to 120 range. Obviously, I have not reevaluated it with SMSC in there. And the reason we haven't reevaluated is the inventory calculation is really messed up right now with this purchase accounting. So when you add $26 million or so, write up the inventory to a full price, sale value, which the GAAP accounting requires, it's really messed up. So we've got to flush out in the next few months and really be able to have a more meaningful indicator that you can latch onto, then analyze the business and look at what the longer-term inventory would be. So I'll give you guys a number in the future, but for Microchip alone, that number in the past was 115 to 120. And with SMSC, it will change.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And, Steve, just cycle time to the fabs?
Steve Sanghi: That we don't publicize. We're very good at it, and we don't want the competition to know.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And that's my follow-on either for you, Steve, or Ganesh. Good understanding of some of the cost synergies with the acquisition. I'm just kind of curious, now that you're a little bit deeper into this, whether or not you've identified some more tangible revenue synergies. And I guess, just given the more historic maybe end market focus of SMSC, help me understand the go-to-market now with the complete portfolio of both the IP from you guys and SMSC?
Steve Sanghi: Go ahead, take that, Ganesh, and I might add something later.
Ganesh Moorthy: So the revenue synergies are obviously different, depending on which of the businesses of SMSC we're talking about. The USB and Ethernet type of products probably have the greatest energy in terms of what we can do to help using our broad channels, and they tend to be closer to some of the traditional Microchip applications and channels, et cetera. Some of the other ones are more targeted by customer. There, it will take more time. We have identified that SMSC has a very deep platform-oriented approach into those markets in areas like automotive and computing and wireless audio. And there, that platform carries many other products that are similar to what Microchip's traditional microcontrollers and analog products are like and memory products are like. And as those platforms come up for redesign, we will influence those platforms to take advantage of solutions that the traditional microcontrollers, analog and memory can provide. So the work is going. There's a lot of cross-training, as I mentioned, between our sales teams, between the divisions. People are excited to look at the platform again, and also, people are working hard on the channel side to enable the channel who has a broad customer base to access, to take advantage of those products that are more appropriate there. But these are all design-in products, they're all proprietary products. And as Steve mentioned, these things will take time to show in the revenue. But it has to start at the design end of things, and that's where we have started right now.
Steve Sanghi: Broad-based effort that moves the needle will take some time, but I'm pleased to say that some of the very first designs have already been one with Microchip product in the customers where SMSC designs were. In some cases, we caught at the right time, the designs were just going to completion and we were able to replace either the microcontroller or analog or memory. I think there are a couple of examples of analog already, there are some examples of microcontroller and memory. So it does work. It's just on a broad base, it will take time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. I was wondering if you could shed some extra light on exposure to end markets following the SMSC acquisition, particularly in the automotive space.
Steve Sanghi: We are not going to break out any end markets like we historically don't. Our business remains very broad-based. We have 70,000-plus customers. Large portion of our business still is through distribution where it's much harder to break out where really the end customer is. So that's something we're not willing to break out.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. Would it be fair to assume that automotive exposure has increased without breaking out any numbers?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, automotive exposure has increased. It was about 25% of their business, and it was not that much of our business. But it has slightly increased. But in percentage terms, based on their business being a lot smaller than ours, it's not a big needle mover. But yes, it has increased.
Operator: We'll go next to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I feel bad asking because you did provide a lot of detail on the deal, but I'm assuming that you're going to continue to break out 8-, 16-bit and 32-bit going forward. So I was just wondering if you could dial in the base in this quarter of that roughly $35 million from SMSC.
Steve Sanghi: I don't know if I understand the question. Will we -- with the 16-bit and 32-bit growth, yes, they will include SMSC in future.
James Eric Bjornholt: We are not providing the dollar breakout for the SMSC businesses for the last quarter.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I was just curious. So is there no 8-bit revenue and it just goes into 16 and 32? And I was just wondering. If you don't want to give the absolute dollar, that's fine. I was just curious.
Steve Sanghi: There is 8-bit revenue and there is 16-bit revenue, there's 32-bit revenue.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. Thought I figure it out. And then on the OpEx side, I just want to make sure I heard this right. It sounds like -- and given the accretion that you're talking about and the deal being a little bit lower and your comments that you're pulling back the core OpEx in the quarter, and then do you -- it sounds like given what you just said about cuts, that cuts continue into the March quarter as well for the core OpEx outside of even what you're doing with SMSC.
Steve Sanghi: I don't know what you mean by cutting the core OpEx. The cut in the core OpEx, when you say core, it means Microchip without SMSC, right?
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Correct.
Steve Sanghi: Okay. So in the OpEx of Microchip without SMSC, cuts are basically coming from 3 areas. One is the pay cut for the management team I talked about. Second is the variable bonus program where bonuses will be quite low in this environment. And third is any attrition we may decide not to replace or any additions that we were planning we may very carefully look at it and drag our feet on it. So those are the 3 areas it will come from. The cuts in the OpEx of SMSC will come in all those factors, plus the result of integration where certain functions that would be consolidated.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right. So in aggregate, I guess, as a way of asking, when you look out into March and June, I mean, you've historically been very good about dialing back your OpEx when there's uncertainty. Do you see this OpEx line moving further down?
Steve Sanghi: I'm not sure if it moves down from March to June.
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes, at this point, we haven't given any guidance for revenue for March or anything else. I think we'd just like to hold off on that for now.
Operator: We'll go next to Ruben Roy with Mizuho Securities.
Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Steve, I just had kind of a follow-up on the commentary that you have around the June with the utilization levels, et cetera, that you're bringing down. And I'm wondering why you're giving us an outlook to June on the factory loadings. Is that because you have visibility out to June? Or is it because you're being conservative at this point given what you're seeing out there? If you could just kind of give us a little detail around the reasoning for giving us that detail.
Steve Sanghi: The reasoning for giving you that detail is I need to give some finality to the employees. I can't just put them on a rotating time off and really not have them know what does it mean, when does it end. At some point in time, people want some predictability in their life on how many hours I'm working as a full-time job. If it's forever, then they should go try to find a full-time job. If it is for a short period of time, these are long-term committed Microchip employees, they'll make their sacrifice and go along with it. So when we model it without a lot of revenue growth, we correct the inventory problem by the end of June. And with distribution building inventory and having more reasonable growth on the revenue, the time period could cut short. So that's what I'm telling the employees, that we expect this RTO, rotating time off, to go through about June, and that's what I'm telling you.
Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Great. Okay. Well, that makes a lot of sense. And just a quick follow-up on the -- around OpEx. If we do assume sort of a flattish revenue growth environment over the next several quarters and you're running at around 30.5% to 31% non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenues, the integration efforts that you're talking about completing in Q1, around the Q1 time frame, will those create a step function down towards your longer-term goal of 27.5% of revenues? Or is it going to take more time to bring OpEx down to that type of level, again, assuming sort of a flattish revenue environment?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, the 27.5% is not achievable with flat revenue from here, and I think if that's what you model, it probably would be just way too conservative. I -- this is -- with just the inventory being that low in this environment, it's pretty much at the bottom here. So if you assume flat revenue, and you said for several quarters and you probably are modeling it way, way too conservative, there will be revenue growth because without the revenue growth, you can't get to our model. The other thing is if the revenue doesn't grow in your model, then even if I bring the inventory down, I cannot still run full production. Then I still don't get the full gross margin recovery. So there has to be some business recovery either through new products or the number of new products we are launching. Ganesh talked about a couple of product lines in the analog group, similarly, we have in the microcontroller group, revenue coming from some of the synergy realized with SMSC. We absolutely will grow revenue next year.
Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Right. I apologize, Steve. I was just kind of -- I guess I drew a wrong conclusion on your commentary around the rotating work schedules out to June and what you had said around the flattish revenue environment driving that. So, I mean, you answered the first -- during the first part of the question, so my mistake.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Well, we want to thank you, everybody, for attending this conference call. Some of the Microchip management will be on the roadshow attending some of the conferences. So we'll see you on the conference circuit, and we'll talk to you again in the next conference call. Thank you.
Operator: And, ladies and gentlemen, once again, that does conclude today's call. We do appreciate everyone's participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
James Eric Bjornholt: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and our results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO; and Gordon Parnell, Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. I will comment on our first quarter of fiscal year 2013 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environments and discuss our guidance. We will then provide an update on our acquisition of SMSC and be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Before I jump into the details, I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP to non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensations. Non-GAAP net sales in the June quarter were $352.4 million and were up 4% from net sales of $338.9 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were about $250,000 higher than GAAP net sales as GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date of an acquisition. This $250K difference relates to our April acquisition of Roving Networks. We expect we will have larger differences in the coming quarters in our GAAP and non-GAAP net sales due to the acquisition of SMSC. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 59% in the June quarter and non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.3% of sales. Operating income was 32.7% of sales and net income was $96.9 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.48 per diluted share, which was at the midpoint of our guidance. On a full GAAP basis, net sales were $352.1 million and gross margins, including share-based compensations and acquisition-related expenses, were 57.7% in the June quarter. Total operating expenses were $106.7 million or 30.3% of sales and includes share-based compensations of $8.7 million and acquisition-related expenses of $5.5 million. GAAP net income was $78.7 million or $0.39 per diluted share. In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 13.3% and the GAAP tax rate was 13.4%. The tax rate was impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various non-recurring items. We expect our forward-looking effective tax rate with the combination of Microchip and SMSC on a non-GAAP basis to be about 13% to 14%. And I remind you that this is without any benefit from the R&D tax credit, which has currently expired and has not yet been reinstated. To summarize the after-tax impact the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the June quarter, share-based compensation was about $0.043. Acquisition-related items were about $0.04 and noncash interest expense was about $0.006. The dividend declared today of $0.3501 per share will be paid on September 5, 2012 to shareholders of record on August 22, 2012. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $68.2 million. Moving on to the balance sheet. Microchip's inventory at June 30, 2012, was $221.5 million or 136 days, down 1 day from the prior-quarter levels. Inventory at our distributors continue to be at historically low levels at 31 days, flat to the prior quarter. I want to remind you that our distribution revenues throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. At June 30, Microchip's accounts receivable balance was $174.7 million, an increase of 2.6% from the balance as of the end of March. Receivable balances are in great condition, an excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. As of June 30, Microchip had a record cash and total investment position of approximately $1.82 billion. During the June quarter, we generated free cash flow of $101.4 million prior to dividend payments. Excluding our acquisition of SMSC, SMSC's cash flow and dividend payments, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $100 million to $110 million in the September quarter. Capital spending was approximately $10 million for the June quarter, and well below our original forecast of $18 million. With some of the June capital plan rolling into September, we expect about $20 million capital spending this quarter excluding any SMSC capital expenditures. We have reduced our overall capital expenditure forecast for the fiscal year from $70 million to $60 million, again excluding any SMSC capital requirements. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $20.7 million, which was down from depreciation of $20.9 million in the March quarter. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines. And let's start with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was up 5.1% on a sequential basis in the June quarter, with all 3 microcontroller businesses up sequentially. During the quarter, we marked another milestone as we shipped our 11 billionth cumulative microcontroller. Our 16-bit business was up 23.7% sequentially in the June quarter and up 18.9% from the year-ago quarter to achieve an all-time record. After a pause in the March quarter, our 32-bit business is up a whopping 71.5% sequentially in the June quarter to achieve another new record. Our 32-bit business was also up 118.5% from the year-ago quarter. Both the 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses continue to benefit from the many demand creation actions we have taken as more customers who have selected to pick microcontroller platform either commence production or ramp their volumes. Our design-win momentum remains strong. And while we're not immune to the macro business conditions, we continue to outgrow the secular growth patterns for these segments. Moving to development tools, we shipped over 47,000 tools in the June quarter. Cumulatively, we have now shipped close to 1.35 million development tools, and development tools sales remain an excellent leading indicator of continued strong design and activity and acceptance of our solutions by customers. Now moving to analog products. Our analog business was up strongly, with 9% sequential growth to also achieve a new record, and performed exceptionally well in the current environment. The synergy of selling more analog content around our high-end microcontrollers, combined with innovative new products and demand creation actions we have taken, are fueling the growth of our analog business. We remain pleased with the design-win momentum our analog business has shown and have a strong pipeline of more innovative new product lines that we will be unveiling over the next few months. Now moving to our memory business. This business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash memory products, was down 2.4% on a sequential basis. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as for our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I am speaking to you from SMSC headquarters in New York today, where we are excited to have completed the acquisition of SMSC this morning. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2013 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2013, including comments on the integration plan for SMSC. Our June quarter results were consistent with what we had guided during the last earnings call. The quarter started out strong, but the negative effects of Europe, weaker economic activity in Europe and weakening economy in China led us to finish the quarter slightly lower than the midpoint of our guidance in revenue. Gross margin was up 85 basis points sequentially, leading to an improvement in operating profit, which was about 32.7% of sales. Our licensing business was down 4.8% sequentially. Our licensing business tends to trail industry manufacturing output by approximately 1 quarter and reflects the manufacturing inventory correction by foundries in IDMs over the prior 2 quarters. However, we did sign 2 new license agreements with 2 major foundry customers last quarter, both of them will be the users of SST flash for the very first time and will help us expand our penetration in the use of SST flash in the embedded world. We continue to build a strong foundation for future growth with these 2 new significant license agreements signed in the June quarter. I will now provide guidance for the September quarter including SMSC revenues. Our guidance is based on the economic data points we are getting that say that Europe's economic recovery has stalled. Europe will continue to be in the doldrums and is made worse so by the summer holidays. And China, which has been the engine of growth, is starting to slow down. In preparing our guidance, we have done bottoms-up analysis region-by-region, distributor-by-distributor and by major customers. We have also included SMSC revenue from today to the end of the quarter as we understand it. We expect our net sales in the September quarter to be between $412 million to $430 million, which is up 17% to 22% sequentially. It includes about $65 million to $70 million revenue from the sales of SMSC products. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 58.5% to 59% of sales for the combined company. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be about 28.5% to 29.5% of sales for the combined company. And we expect to combine from being non-GAAP operating profit to be between 29% to 30.5% of sales, the Non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.50 to $0.52 per share. Now we will provide you some updates on SMSC acquisition. We're excited to close the acquisition and begin the process of integration to drive shareholder value. We want to welcome all SMSC employees on this journey. In Microchip culture, employees are our greatest strengths. Today, we would like to cover 4 subjects before I open the call for questions. First, I will explain to you how the revenue of SMSC will be consolidated into Microchip's FUT [ph] revenue reporting. Second, Ganesh will give you an update on the integration planning. Third, Eric will give you guidance on the accretion we expect to get from this acquisition. And finally, I will update Microchip's long-term financial model, which will now include SMSC. So let us begin with how the revenue of SMSC will be included in Microchip's revenue reporting. As you know, Microchip breaks its revenue reporting in 5 different imported product lines: microcontrollers, analog products, memory products, licensing and others. Over the last 3 months, we have studied SMSC's products. SMSC breaks down this revenue into 5 reported product lines: automotive, wireless audio, USB, industrial networking and computing, more end market-based rather than product-determined. Many of SMSC's products are based on the microcontroller core. They are, in fact, special-purpose microcontrollers for automotive, wireless audio or computing applications. These are not in most specialty microcontrollers than touch controllers are for mobile phone applications that many of our investors are very familiar with. In SMSC's 10-Q filing on June 10, 2012, SMSC reported $103 million of revenue for their quarter ended May 31, 2012. If such revenue had been on Microchip's clock, we would have reported 43% of their revenue as microcontroller product revenue. The remaining 57% of the products are mixed signal/analog products, which we would have added to our analog product revenue. SMSC's mixed signal/analog products sell into many markets like automotive, PC, industrial and consumer, and we expect that they will benefit from Microchip's broad penetration in a large horizontal customer base. Similarly, we expect Microchip's microcontrollers, analog and memory products will find home in more automotive, wireless audio and computing customers with SMSC. As of today, we do not expect that the acquisition of SMSC will create any additional report about product lines. SMSC's revenue will be included with Microchip's microcontroller and analog revenue reported product lines. This is perhaps too much made of Microchip being a horizontal market company and SMSC being a vertical market company. Over the last decade, Microchip has added vertical market resources in the area of automotive, home appliances, medical, Smart Energy, digital power, motor control, lighting and several other market segments. We see the acquisition of SMSC as a natural addition to Microchip's continued growth and penetration into certain vertical markets. The addition of SMSC will add wireless audio and computing as 2 additional vertical markets for Microchip. The automotive market is already a significant area of focus on Microchip. It's not something we break out, but we have broad automotive penetration and we do business with nearly every tier 1 automotive manufacturers. Microchip has devices in many hundreds of car and truck models around the world. For example, there are over 20 Microchip microcontrollers on the current model of the Mercedes S-Class cars. So I will now pass it on to Ganesh, who will give you update on our integration planning. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Steve. Since the announcement of the acquisition, we have engaged in extensive discussions with the management of SMSC to understand their business, organization and systems. We have developed a detailed integration plan that we have begun to execute starting today. SMSC currently runs 5 product groups: the automotive products group, the wireless audio product group, the USB product group, industrial and networking product group and the computing group. Microchip will continue to run these 5 product groups. At Microchip, we call the product groups as divisions. But essentially, they are the same, and there's no difference between a product group versus a division, as the 2 different companies have called it. There could be some movement of specific products from SMSC divisions to Microchip divisions or vice versa, as we fine tune the organization and look for synergies and execution. We have also studied the business systems of both companies. We have laid out a plan that will combine the best of both systems of the 2 companies. The 2 companies will operate on a single set of business systems, and the estimate of this transition will be completed sometime in the calendar first quarter of 2013. In regards to manufacturing, SMSC is established company and uses many of the same wafer foundries that Microchip uses for acquiring some of our wafers. We do not expect that Microchip will bring any SMSC products to our in-house wafer fabs. SMSC subcontracts 100% of its assembly and 90% of its test. Many of the packages that SMSC uses are different than Microchip's packages. The final test systems that SMSC uses are also different than Microchip's test systems. Therefore, we expect that the majority of the assembly and test of SMSC products will remain with subcontractors. We will continue to do a make-versus-buy analysis for newly developed products and expect to ship the mix to Microchip assembly and test when it is cost-effective. Microchip will, however, combine the manufacturing systems. These are wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses. We expect that all SMSC products will be shipping from Microchip's manufacturing systems by the start of a new year on January 1, 2013 or earlier. Regarding field sales and applications, we have done a thorough analysis of the sales and application structure of SMSC. Over the last decades, as Steve said, while Microchip had a predominantly horizontal sales force, we have selectively added vertical marketing capability in several areas like automotive, home appliances, medical, Smart Energy, digital power, et cetera. We believe that SMSC's sales force will help us expand our vertical market capabilities further in the areas of wireless, audio and computing. We are, therefore, planning to keep SMSC's sales and applications engineers and will add them to our vertical market sales force in conjunction with the horizontal sales force that we have. Many of the large multinational customers may see a combined effort by the 2 sales forces. Many other accounts will continue to be called on by either the Microchip or the SMSC salespersons with many cross-selling opportunities. We also plan to combine the distribution network for the 2 companies. Many of the distributors for the 2 companies are the same, but many are also different, and our goal is to achieve expanded distribution capabilities for the products of both companies. Finally, in regards to human resources, we expect to combine the human resource systems as well. This includes the compensation plans, medical and dental benefit plans, equity plans and all other benefit plans like 401(k), vacation benefits, et cetera. But this combination of plans could take some time, and certain combinations will be more convenient for the beginning of the new calendar year. Meanwhile, SMSC will continue to operate with their current plans. And with this, I will now pass it on to Eric, who will provide guidance with accretion from the SMSC merger. Eric?
James Eric Bjornholt: Thanks, Ganesh. With the rate at which we expect the integrations to progress, we currently expect the SMSC acquisition to be accretive in the current September quarter by about $0.03 per share on a non-GAAP basis. During our acquisition announcement on May 2, 2012, we had said that we expect the acquisition to be accretive in the first full quarter after close. We have now pulled the accretion schedule in and expect the acquisition to be accretive starting the partial September quarter on a non-GAAP basis. We now expect that the acquisition will add approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share to Microchip's non-GAAP EPS for the December 2012 quarter. For the March 2013 quarter, we expect the accretion to increase to about $0.07 to $0.08 per share. And for the June 2013 quarter, we expect to be in the full range of accretion, which is expected to be about $0.08 to $0.09 per share per quarter. These numbers are preliminary and depends upon the speed of the integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and the inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparisons to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts to continue to report their non-GAAP estimates the first call. With that, I will pass the call back to Steve, who will provide you Microchip's long-term model including SMSC. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: As you very well know, Microchip has maintained a premium financial model for gross margin, operating expenses and operating profit for a very long time. Every time we do an acquisition, where the target's operating business model is not at par with Microchip, there is substantial speculation regarding what the acquisition will do to Microchip's combined business model. Our track record has shown that Microchip has been able to improve the business model of its acquisitions, and our combined business model has remained virtually unchanged. In the case of SMSC, we expect to implement substantial business process improvements to include gross margin percentage, lower operating expenses and substantially increase its operating profit. Our long-term model for the combined company will be a gross margin of about 60%, plus or minus 0.5%; operating expenses of about 27.5%, plus or minus 0.5%; and operating profit of about 32.5%, plus or minus 0.5%. All of these numbers are non-GAAP. This long-term model will continue to be a premium model in the semiconductor industry and will drive substantial shareholder value. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Steve, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of an outlook in terms of what you're seeing from customer order rates by different geographies whether you expect -- which geographies do you expect to be up or down in the next quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Well, if you recall the guidance we provided on sales, all the growth is coming from the partial SMSC quarter added to our numbers. If you take the midpoint of our guidance minus the SMSC revenue of $65 million to $70 million, Microchip is flat to up with just 0.2%, 0.3% or so. In terms of geography, Europe's geography is very weak, made worse so in some of the quarter as we said. So that will definitely be down. And the other geographies of U.S. and Asia were largely -- make up for the drop in Europe.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Fair enough. And then as a follow-up, can you maybe just address the R&D line in terms of absolute dollars? I understand where you're talking about in terms of long-term percentages, but can you maybe talk about whether you expect R&D to drift up or whether you are not trying to reign that in over the next 2 quarters and add to the dollar basis?
Steve Sanghi: Well, if you add substantial R&D of SMSC together with Microchip, then those numbers will trend down as we gain synergies and make some restructure and changes, if that's what your question is. But if you compare it to a Microchip R&D number as we had it last quarter, of course numbers will go up because there's substantial R&D from SMSC being added.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Of course, but the combined R&D should slow down over time in terms of dollars?
Steve Sanghi: Well, it should go down short-term in dollars and long-term in percentages, yes.
James Eric Bjornholt: Right. So we're not giving any specifics of the breakout of the operating expenses at this point in time, Jim. So we've shared the long-term model on what we expect this quarter. So that shows that operating expenses should trend down, but we haven't given specifics on any particular line item.
Steve Sanghi: See, we have a partial SMSC this quarter and then there'll be full SMSC next quarter for the total operating expenses including R&D or as R&D itself are going to rise in September and rise in December because of SMSC.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Steve, on SMSC, to achieve the targets, do you think you will have to get rid of any of the businesses? Or do you think that you can get it to those targets with the current mix of business that they have?
Steve Sanghi: So there is no selling of the business involved in getting to those targets. But there's a -- because the definite restructuring within the business itself using the combined energy of the 2 companies, using synergy in R&D, synergy in sales, synergy in operations, IT, finance and other things.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And for my follow-up, would you care to give us any sort of long-term revenue growth target for the combined company?
Steve Sanghi: It's too early in the year. We just started today.
Operator: And next, we'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes. Just a follow-up to Chris' follow-up. Relative to kind of understanding when you can get the revenue synergies, clearly, the accretion guidance makes the financial rationale for this acquisition readily impaired. But as you think about either trying to leverage your distribution channel or SMSC distribution channel or curtain vice versa or your customer base, when do you start to think you'll see dividends on the top line from them?
Steve Sanghi: Well, nearly all of their products are proprietary and a very high portion of Microchip's products are proprietary. And you know that proprietary products, they take anywhere from lower 6 months for design win to as long as 1.5 year, 2 years in design before they go to production. So when some of the low hanging fruit from distribution, from each of the distribution in customers, we could get that in 6 to 9 months, but some of it will take longer. And it's also by product. We take much longer in automotive for us to sell into their customers, for them to sell into our customers. But it will be quicker in consumer and it could be quicker in the PC segments. Some industrial segments, especially the USB products and Ethernet products are very, very good products for our broad horizontal customer base with regard with selling to 70,000 customers. And those are easier products to get designed and also relative to automotive.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: That's helpful. And then maybe, Ganesh, as a follow-up. Can you just remind us how much of SMSC's business was done through distribution and what percent do you think your distribution overlap versus new distribution opportunity when you look at the revenue stream?
Ganesh Moorthy: I'm going to hand that to Eric. Eric, do you remember the percentages of their existing business in distribution?
James Eric Bjornholt: I believe it's somewhere between 25% and 30%. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me. I don't know if Gordon might.
Gordon W. Parnell: Yes. Actually, it's closer to 30%.
James Eric Bjornholt: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Steve, well, first of all, congratulations on closing the deal. I know you're trying to keep the product groups and the divisions, but are there any overlaps you've seen at this point that may be areas of easy consolidation by which of, by way of eliminating one and to help create some [indiscernible] synergy? And how much is that?
Steve Sanghi: So there isn't much of product overlap per se. It's like they don't make horizontal general-purpose microcontrollers. 43% of the business is microcontrollers, but they are specialty microcontrollers for automotive, for wireless audio, for computing embedded control and things like that. But there is a substantial overlap in the R&D development because to do a specialty microcontroller, you have to do a large amount of R&D to really build the panel, build the I/Os, build the analog, having an extension, analog library, some of the IT you may have to buy or build from inside or outside, Ethernet, USB, converters, flip-flops, and on and on and on. There are hundreds of circuits that are developed and then you get those circuits and put them together to build a chip. So there is a substantial synergy in developing that library because we develop it today at Microchip and they develop at SMSC. Now some of it comes very quickly, but some of it takes a little bit of time because number one, 2 companies may not be at the same foundry or in the same process node. So the current products will continue where they're being developed, but as we look forward on the even 3 or 6 months forward, the new product design starts. We will try to converge them on similar processes at the same foundries, so these libraries have synergy. There is a large amount of library developed at Microchip, at foundries where SMSC is bringing some of their products. So they could be idiot users of our libraries. Similarly, we are going to certain foundries with some of our products where they're already present, so we can use their library. That's where the R&D synergy comes from.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: That's helpful. And let me just ask you separately, if I look at the 60% long-term gross margin targets, can you help me rank order the -- what of -- are you comfortable either way, end market or by product group? How the gross margin contribution will come? And I'm asking this question specifically while the when I look at areas like USB and some of the computing product areas that they generally carry lower gross margins? And I'm wondering whether how that fits into the long-term vision of the combined company, as especially given its gross margin targets?
Steve Sanghi: So your information is not correct, that they carry lower gross margin. A lot of people looking at some of our competitors, also to microcontrollers carry lower gross margins or 8-bit carry lower gross margins or those assumptions have been wrong regarding Microchip also. We know how to make gross margin. And SMSC actually did very well in gross margins. They actually, last quarter, already was about 58%, I think. So I think the numbers you quoted, that those has no gross margin, is incorrect. It may be correct in general, if you look at the other people that build the commodity products to the business, but they were building other proprietary products. Overall gross margin is very good for the company. It's very good for Microchip. And our gross margin has been down a little bit because of absorption, because the revenue has been down because of the recession. When our fab fill up again as the business comes back, you know our gross margin goes into low 60s again like always. And their gross margin is very rough. So the guidance we gave you on overall gross margin of 60% is solid.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Just first, the question on SMSC. Now that you obviously, you've done a lot more homework on the integration now and presented the plan, as you look prior to -- compared to when you're doing due diligence as you announced the deal, what's the biggest surprises that you've seen either on the positive or negative now that you've had a chance to dig in deeper?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the negative surprise largely has been the time it took to get approval from China. Although the people, lawyers working on it have told us it's very rare that a company gets approval in phase 1 in China, and this is the fastest any company has gotten. I think ADI's yield took 5, 6 months. But with all the deals that we have done, public deals and others, negative surprise was it took about 30 days longer than we would have liked. The positive surprises, I think of [indiscernible] and then understand it better. And probably original assessment was hedged and we are more confident as we have closed the deal and risked covering the deal. Closing has gone away as we have looked into the IT systems, the financial systems, the R&D understand the library, the processes, where to do business and all that. And I think we feel very confident and very, very good about it, and as we work with very good, talented employees, many them, we have worked with for the last 3 months with obviously, a fair amount of restriction in really what we could get because the companies have to operate independently. But we are very positive and very confident that as we engage in the coming weeks, this thing will be a great acquisition.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. And as a follow-up, just with respect to the core Microchip business, I, for one, have been surprised that with the things have slowed down on the macro as they have. Can you talk about what you guys are doing from a manufacturing standpoint, perhaps from a cost standpoint to deal with the current situation and where we go from here?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I mean our current situation isn't drastic like it could be for some other people. I mean, we are -- we have a solid gross margin. Our inventory days are flat. Actually, we were down by 1 day, so we don't really consider a situation to be anything that really needs correction. Business grew in the March quarter. It grew in the June quarter, maybe not as much as we wanted to, but it's a sizable growth. Our microcontroller business was up 5%. Our analog business was up 9%, so the reductions came from licensing and some of the other memory businesses. Some of it was subcontracts. So our products are doing well. And I think we'll -- our plan is to run the factory flat, both in the front end and back end, and inventory will continue to come down slowly. And eventually, there will be an upturn and the factory will fill up again.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just a final point. With running the factories flat in the near term, what do you expect inventory, your own inventory to do in the near term as a result of that?
Steve Sanghi: Well, so at last quarter's production, our inventory went down by 1%. So if nothing else changes, then our inventory should go down maybe by another day. Although the distribution is a different equation, so the distribution inventory was nearly all-time low.
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes, it's 31 days.
Steve Sanghi: 31 days. And the normal has been between 31 to 45. So at any point in time, if the distribution starts to rebuild inventory, then our inventory would come down substantially. And it's largely, went up here because the distribution has been keeping very low inventory. And when distribution keeps low, we want to keep it high so it's available to the channel. Now having said all that, going forward, our inventory gets mixed with the SMSC. So the inventory numbers will report next quarter, will be -- have 2 months of SMSC and then 3 months of SMSC. So it's going to be impossible to compare it to really what happened in the prior quarter in the baseline.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.
Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: A question for you on SMSC going into the December quarter. SMSC is kind of tough with this -- they had an off quarter and they had a very strong November and a weak February quarter. And I guess I'm trying to figure out if maybe you could lend us some color on how we should we think about the seasonality of SMSC's business on what is now a calendar December quarter?
Steve Sanghi: So that's a very, very good question. That's something we have pondered with ourselves. Their quarter ended in November and then February. So in the February quarter, they picked 2 very bad months. One is usually the month of December, that has lots of holiday. And then January usually starts out slow after the holidays, and then you get Chinese New Year. You all get that in the one quarter. So that was a very weak quarter. And I think now on our clock in December, you will pick up the December weakness and the December quarter and the Chinese New Year will go with ours. So we'll have to get some cycles of learning. I think you can look at the prior data and do some averaging. Give us some time on our clock and I think we'll be able to help you more. But today is our first day and I think I will just be guessing.
Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Okay. I guess I'll ask you that next quarter. The other question now for you. It looks like your 8-bit MCU revenue was down slightly, sequentially in the quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Let me correct. Our 8-bit revenue was up sequentially.
Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: It was up sequentially? But as some call it slightly or I guess, I'll look to my data on that. The -- but as a lead indicator, 8-bit based on your -- on Steve's general comments on the cycle that you've given us in the past, I guess I'm looking if you could give us your opinion on what you think on the cycle on demand going forward here for the next couple of quarters?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the September quarter, we've given you guidance already. And December quarter, usually the weak quarter for Microchip historically, if you look at it. So this quarter and next quarter, given the backdrop of the economy, of fiscal cliff rating, election's coming, Europe in doldrums, I think the hope is on China, there is some activity in China to try to come up with a new fiscal package. And when China comes up with fiscal packages, that's really to promote usually home appliances and automotive and other stuff for their consumers to buy. We benefited very well when that happened the last time. There is some talk of that right now. If that happens, we'll do very well. And China is the largest geography now. We ship more in China than U.S. But Europe will be weak and U.S. is anybody's guess, I think, if there is no breakthrough in Washington, U.S. will continue to be where it is, more of the same.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Can you say what similar customer feedback has been on the merger acquisition?
Steve Sanghi: So the -- when the deal was first announced, obviously, some customers get nervous regarding what Microchip might do. And a lot of this nervousness is actually deferred, fear uncertainty and doubt created by either the competitors or the analysts, honestly, and I'll tell you why. It is to competitor's benefit to go to major customers and say, "Oh, Microchip today, high margin company. They're different there. Look at the profitability. They're not going to support this. They are not going to support that." I expect them to do so because if I'm the competitor of somebody, I'll do the same. The analysts, with lack of information, very little information is available on May 2 when we announced. A lot of reports come out, some guessing we'll sell the USB. We'll do this. We'll do that. We'll not support this. We'll not support that. And people read that, too, and that makes them nervous regarding the programs they continually have won. So SMSC work very well together. Their management, kudos to them, reached out to us when there were some significant high and large customer concerns, and we made some joint calls to the customers to make them feel comfortable. And in today's call, as people are hearing officially, we're going to keep all the divisions and all the products, keep their sales force, should really alleviate any remaining concerns. Actually, there haven't been concerns after the initial one, which we satisfy.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And also other customers, maybe in the automotive, where with your larger scale, that you'd build 1 plus 1 could equal 2.5 or so?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. I mean, absolutely. Even in the last 3 months, I have visited Microchip's automotive customers where they also wanted to talk about SMSC. In most cases, we could not because -- anti trust issues and all that when it wasn't clear that there is very high interest in SMSC's customers. Microchip is a very good supplier to them. I gave you an example. We have over 20 microcontrollers in Mercedes S-Class cars, and there's a great relationship there to -- with their suppliers and all that. So obviously, they want to talk to us.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Sumit Dhanda with ISI Group.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Steve, first question I have for you is, is there any color you can offer up on when exactly you're starting to see the weakness in your business in the June quarter? And then, in July, is that just state, low at -- flat at a low level exiting Q2, has there been any pickup or deterioration? Any color you can provide would be appreciated?
Steve Sanghi: So if you look at it, we actually made that quarter. Our guidance was 3 to 7 for midpoint of 5 when we came in at 4. So a slight weakness. And I think most of that came in second half of the quarter. At our earnings call, which was on May 2 or 3 time frame, we had given that guidance. So, so far at that time, we were okay. And the weakness developed later on. I think the last month, specially June, was weak and the late part of May could have been weaker here with week 2.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And then any color on July?
Steve Sanghi: It's continuing at that pace. That's why we're guiding roughly flat.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then as my follow-up, growth in your 16- and 32-bit business is obviously very impressive, but seems like although 8-bit grew, it probably grew very modestly. Any thoughts there? And at least compare those with some of the other guys reporting their 8-bit business, which was a little bit better, is it just a timing issue in your opinion or an exposure issue from an end market or product-cycle basis?
Steve Sanghi: It's -- it could be anything. It could be end market exposure, the more exposed to automotive, which was our strongest segments. It could be geography. It could be where the business is. And we have substantial growth in 16, 32. Our 8-bit business also is larger than most of those -- so their 8-bit businesses is smaller. So it could be a starting issue at some time. I can't compare to other people's numbers because I don't know what happened in their business.
Operator: And we'll move next to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: First of all, congratulations on closing the deal. And thanks for the accretion schedule. That's very helpful. But just a quick question on that, Steve. Are you just assuming cost cuts at this point in time when -- with the accretion schedule that you gave us, so you're building in some sort of cross-selling incentives? So could you give us an idea of how we should think of cross sales?
Steve Sanghi: The accretion schedule that I have given you for now through March and June does not really have revenue synergy in it. As I mentioned earlier, if I want a design tomorrow, we'll be 9 months to production at least. Those are the fastest schedules and most will take longer. So the accretion schedule we have given you is largely through synergy and cost savings and longer.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Got it. Steve, and then another follow-up question for you was, SMSC obviously, lower gross margins, lower operating margins compared to Microchip. And I'm not asking for numbers, but I'm just curious of qualitatively, you could give us a hint or some idea of what areas do you see the most supreme? And would it be COGS? Would it be OpEx? And any kind of color would be helpful?
Steve Sanghi: So I cannot break it down much for you. I think based on SMSC's public number and ours, you might be able to do some triangulation. I've given you synergy and you guys are the model on odd numbers. For me to further break it down, I think it will be telling you guys before the employees have heard it and all that so...
Operator: And we'll move next to JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: I was hoping you could provide a little bit more details on how to think about the new employee stock plan for the SMSC guys and how that would affect the non-GAAP to GAAP translations?
Steve Sanghi: So all vested stock options of SMSC were cashed out now essentially at the deal price. All unvested equity was assumed. And what we have in our share count, I believe, the guidance table has noted the bottom that shows about 700,000 shares dilution.
James Eric Bjornholt: We did shares from that. That's not the number of shares that come into the plans.
Steve Sanghi: Yes, so -- but there's 700,000 shares added to Microchip's otherwise share count for September quarter because of the options we're assuming. Is your question related to this inducement plan that we filed today?
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: Yes, that was the one.
Steve Sanghi: Okay. So FUC -- I'm sorry, SMSC had a shared appreciation rights plan, which was the cash settled. So they -- an employee gets a certain number of SARs, which are good for 10 years. And after they are vested, they could really, at any point in time, exercise it. And from strike price to the fair market value, they get cash from SMSC. All the vested ones, SARs were cashed out also. The unvested ones are being converted to this inducement plan, and there are about 440,000 shares in that plan. So that's the number, 440,000. The dilution is not all of them because there's a strike price also. So the dilution is already in the 700,000 shares. So whatever comes out of the SAR dilution is already included in the other 700,000 number I gave you. And you can basically ignore this new plan we filed. That's more -- we didn't have a plan like that to convert, so we put a plan like that. But the number that's important to you is already in our guidance table. That fully is inclusive of all invested equity.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: Great. Thanks for the clarity. I appreciate that. Then we could just go back to your higher responding to this global weakening. I'm wondering if you're doing anything about plant shutdowns? Or is there any natural days off this quarter because of vacations? Well, it seems to have come to an end last quarter. So I'm wondering perhaps summer vacations are giving you a bit of latitude there to allow utilization rates to fall. Could you provide some hints as to that?
Steve Sanghi: There's nothing we need to do in business than we are doing. And like I said earlier, we don't feel that our inventory is alarming. No, it's not 160 days or something. Inventory is probably high by 15 days or so or to what I will think comfortable. We're at 120 and 133, 13 days. I'm not -- I don't need to do a -- I have enough on my plate to get accretion from SMSC, manage the business, restructure it, get synergies from other teams. So we don't really need to do any shutdowns. We don't need to do anything. I think if the business falls off for any reason further, which we're not expecting, we don't have a crisis at hand. We're not [indiscernible]. The business isn't down like some of the other companies. It's really doing fine. Our business compared to a year ago was down...
James Eric Bjornholt: 5.9%.
Steve Sanghi: 5.9%. I mean, that's just -- the framework you guys are in, where you're reading, what other people are doing. And so you're asking us what we're doing. The business is only down 5.9% versus a year ago. The company gross margin is 59%. Operating profit is 32.7%. And those kind of numbers, we're not in a crisis situation. We don't have to do anything.
Operator: And we'll go next to Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: This question is a little bit of a high-level question. And that is, how long will it take you to unify some of the design tools so that a client will be able to use those Microchip blocks and SMSC blocks together in a unified development environment? How long will that take? And will that present more of a significant opportunity to then recognize revenue synergy from the merger?
Steve Sanghi: I will forward that to Ganesh. I think he has looked at it more closely.
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, I think for some time to come, the tools are going to be different. They are not impediments for the customer. In many cases, the customer was doing a design with a set of tools. It will take us some time to assess what combination of tools makes sense. It doesn't make sense in all cases, and then we'll make those changes as appropriate. But I don't see any impediments to customers to adopt either our product, if they're an SMSC customer, or an SMSC product, if they're an existing Microchip customer using the tools we have today. And it's just we can make enhancements and there'll be improvements as we go along. But there are no impediments.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then one my follow-up was a broader economic question. I think, Steve, in the past, you've talked about Microchip seeing inflections in the economy a little bit earlier than peers. It sounds like you really haven't seen improvement in your order rates yet, yet there's some other peers who are seeing stronger second halfs due to application exposure and whatnot. I guess my question is, based on your experience, would you have expected to have seen improvement in the economy by this point? And I guess, another way of asking that, other peers you are seeing improvements in the second half, do you think it's just the seasonal build and they are yet to see a contraction again in the first half of next year?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the economies at the low point, and for all we know, it could get further worse with what's happening in Europe. And I don't know if I completely understand your question. The question I would have expected is, "Why didn't you see the weakness earlier that we always see?" You're asking a question, "Why didn't we see the improvement?" And I'm not sure business is improving right now. But the question I expected that I'd like to answer is, "Why didn't we see the weakness earlier this time?" We always see the weakness a quarter earlier. Well, we would have seen the weakness a quarter earlier if our superior growth of 16-bit, 32-bit and analog and positive sequential growth on analog, both June quarter and March quarter, had an overcoming. That's why we didn't see. So if we had a normal level of growth on 16, 32 and if 8-bit business was flat to down, then we would have seen the weakness compared to the industry earlier. We did see a lower run rate, customers correcting for inventory, lack of confidence, but number of new designs go to -- going to production on 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and analog overcame it. And now the question you're asking me is, "Why we're not seeing the improvement earlier?" I don't know who's seeing it. And I'm watching the dust from many of our competitors. And the businesses are bad.
Operator: Next we'll go to Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: And congratulations on your biggest deal ever. Just from a financial reporting standpoint, it's very helpful to get the product detail. Can you provide the 16-bit business, 32-bit business analog? Will we be getting the same thing for the SMSC business in the future?
Steve Sanghi: We haven't exactly figured out what we're going to provide you. I think for reporting, as we said, the SMSC business will break into 2 pieces: microcontrollers and analog. Microcontrollers will be added to a microcontroller number, analog to an analog number, to the extent that microcontroller has 8-, 16-, 32-bit complements which they do, they will add to our respective 8, 16 and 32, if that was your question.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Yes, that's the question, Steve. So in this transition period, there'll be an adjustment where you add those in. And will you be giving us some mapping to tell us how much of the SMSC business went into each of those segments for modeling?
Steve Sanghi: I think we'll do some of that, yes, not enough for you to be able to call it the 8-bit.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: That's touche. And then a follow-up question for Eric. Eric, it sounds like that the accretion assumptions were all expense-based and there's not a revenue contribution there. Is that correct?
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes, that's correct.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: I mean, in what you provided so far?
James Eric Bjornholt: That's correct. We have assumed that the revenue synergies take longer.
Operator: And next we'll go to Ray Rund with Shaker Investments.
Raymond Joseph Rund - Shaker Investments, L.L.C.: I had a couple of questions. One is, can you give us the breakdown of what your revenue was by the various product areas that you -- as you usually disclose in your 10-Q?
James Eric Bjornholt: Sure. Sure, we can do that. So microcontroller revenue was $240,594,000. Memory was $40,718,000. Analog was $47,184,000. Licensing was $20,282,000. And other was $3,608,000. And those are non-GAAP numbers.
Raymond Joseph Rund - Shaker Investments, L.L.C.: Those are non-GAAP numbers?
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes.
Steve Sanghi: There was a $250,000 non-GAAP difference, a consumer [indiscernible].
James Eric Bjornholt: Yes, that's -- it's small. I don't have those numbers in front of me right at the moment, but it's a small difference. And if you want to follow-up with me, I can give them to you.
Raymond Joseph Rund - Shaker Investments, L.L.C.: Okay. Also, I mean it sounds from just taking a quick look at what your guidance is, that unless the non-GAAP SMSC numbers are widely different from the GAAP SMSC numbers, it looks like you're going to see your non-SMSC revenue go down sequentially in these coming quarters. Is that correct or did I miss something in my computation?
James Eric Bjornholt: I think you missed at a few. If you back the numbers out of the $65 million to $70 million in growth, I think you'll see that there is a midpoint of slightly above flat. But it is relatively flat.
Ganesh Moorthy: So typically, midpoint of the guidance and subtract $60 million, $70.5 million out of that, you'll get a Microchip number, which is slightly north of our last quarter.
Operator: And we'll go next to Suji De Silva with ThinkEquity.
Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division: Two quick questions, hopefully. First of all, Steve, you talked about the China plants. Market is potentially being an uplift in the second half. Do you have any insights as to whether that the incentive programs are going to come? And if they come back and the timing? And what's your exposure to that market will be about the term?
Steve Sanghi: I don't have the better claim to [indiscernible] for sure. No, I do not know what's the status of those programs and whether they will be implemented.
Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division: Are you seeing anything in the order patterns that might indicate people building up for that?
Steve Sanghi: No.
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And then the second question really is around synergies with SMSC. Should we think, all things being equal to revenue, synergies are more from SMSC's autos business and the consumer businesses versus their computing businesses? Or is that not a fair statement?
Steve Sanghi: No, that's not a fair statement. We expect to be able to sell the USB, industrial products into our customers and the computing and automotive also. And we expect to sell some of our products into wireless audio, data synergy, automotive customers, their computing customers, large computing customers and some of the consumer customers, so it's both ways.
Operator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: So I just wanted to say thank you all for attending the conference today. It's been a very busy day for us here today, closing the acquisition and doing this call at the same time. Although it kind of worked out because after closing, we were able to give you back more information than we could have given you if the closing was next week or next month. So we'll see many of you in the conferences that will happen this quarter and we'll be at some of those. Thank you.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Now for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the call over to Microchip's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Mr. Sanghi, please go ahead.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Debbie, and good morning, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our 2 press releases regarding earnings and announcement of the signing of definitive agreement to acquire Standard Microsystems Inc., known as SMSC, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are: Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO; Eric Bjornholt, CFO; and Gordon Parnell, Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. We have 2 back-to-back conference calls today. This call is to discuss Microchip's fiscal fourth quarter 2012 and fiscal year '12 financial results and fiscal quarter 1 2013 guidance. Followed by that, we will take investors and analyst questions on our financial performance, outlook and performance of our product lines. During this call, we will not take any questions on the acquisition. Then in one hour, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern standard time, we will have our second call in which we will introduce you to SMSC, explain our rationale for this acquisition and outline the next steps and the timeline. In the second call, we will not take any questions about our earnings. So I will now pass the call to Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's CFO.
J. Eric Bjornholt: , Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Before I jump in into details, I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results. I will be referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of share base compensation, acquisition-related expenses and other nonrecurring events. Net sales in the March 2012 quarter were $338.9 million, up sequentially 3% from net sales of $329.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and were down 10.8% from net sales of $380 million in the March 2011 quarter. On a geographic basis in the March quarter, revenue in the Americas was up 1.6% sequentially. Europe was up 14.5% sequentially, and Asia was down 0.7% sequentially, and was seasonally impacted by the Lunar New Year holidays. The March quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year in Europe, and this year has followed that pattern. Net sales for fiscal 2012 were $1.383 billion, down 7% from the fiscal 2011 levels. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.1% in the March quarter, an increase from the 56.8% achieved in the preceding quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.2% of sales in the March quarter. Operating income was 31.9% of sales, and net income was $94.3 million or $0.46 per diluted share, which was above the midpoint of our guidance of $0.45. In the March quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share was favorably impacted by about $0.01 in the other income area of the income statement from the redemption of a previously written down Auction Rate Security at par value and some favorable foreign exchange hedging activities. We are not forecasting with these favorable items in the other income area of the P&L will repeat in the June 2012 quarter.  For fiscal 2012, on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.2%, operating expenses were 25.9% of sales, and operating income was 32.3% of sales. Net income was $383.7 million or $1.89 per diluted share. On a full GAAP basis in the March 2012 quarter, gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related intangible amortization were 57.2%. Total operating expenses were $100 million or 29.5% of sales and includes share-based compensation of $8.5 million, $1.5 million in special charges related to a patent license settlement and acquisition-related expenses of $1 million. GAAP net income was $80.6 million or $0.39 per diluted share, which was above the midpoint of our guidance of $0.38. For fiscal 2012, GAAP gross margins were 57.3%, operating expenses were 28.6% of sales, and operating income was 28.7% of sales. GAAP net income was $336.7 million or $1.65 per diluted share. In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 12.6%, and the GAAP tax rate was 12.3%. Our tax rate is impacted by a variety of factors, including the mix of geographical profits, and withholding taxes associated with our licensing business. On a forward-looking basis, we expect our effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be 13% to 13.5% and our GAAP effective tax rate to be about 25 basis points lower than that, excluding any discrete onetime events. To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share on the March quarter, share-based compensation was about $0.042, acquisition-related items were about $0.012, the patent license settlement was about $0.007, and the noncash interest expense was about $0.006.  The dividend declared today of $0.35 per share will be paid on May 31, 2012, to shareholders of record on May 17, 2012. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $67.8 million. Moving on to the balance sheet. Microchip's inventory at March 31, 2012, was $217.3 million or 137 days, flat to the prior quarter levels. Inventory at our distributors was 31 days, which is down 4 days from the prior quarter level. As measured in days, our distributors have the lowest level of inventory that they have held in the last 10 years. We believe that distributors will need to increase their level of on-hand inventory over the coming quarters. I want to remind you that our distribution revenues throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis.  At March 31, Microchip's accounts receivable balance was $170.2 million, an increase of 14% from the balance as of the end of December. The increase in receivables can primarily be attributed to the back-end weighting of shipments in the quarter due to the Lunar New Year holidays in Asia, distributors not reducing inventory as much as they did in the December quarter and the increase in revenue. Receivable balances continue to be in great condition with excellent payment performance from our customers. As of March 31, Microchip's cash and total investment position was a record $1.79 billion and was up about $17 million from the prior quarter levels. Our total cash and investment position is projected to grow by approximately $100 million to $110 million in the June quarter, prior to our dividend payments and any acquisition activity. Capital spending was $3.9 million in the March quarter and was $62.5 million for fiscal 2012, about $5.5 million less than we communicated in our last earnings call due to the rollover of some of this capital into the first quarter of fiscal 2013. We are continuing to invest in equipment to support the revenue growth of our new products and technologies and our capital expenditure forecast for fiscal 2013 is about $70 million, including the $5.5 million rollover from fiscal '12. We expect capital expenditures to be about $18 million in the June quarter. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $20.9 million, which was down about $0.5 million from the December quarter. Depreciation expense for fiscal 2012 was $86.4 million. Depreciation expense is projected to be about $20.7 million in the June quarter. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was up 5.5% on a sequential basis in the March quarter, with both 8-bit and 16-bit product lines up sequentially. For fiscal year '12, our microcontroller business was down 8.4% as compared to fiscal year '11 due to the broad-based inventory correction accentuated by the aftereffects of the twin disasters last year, namely the earthquake in Japan, and the flooding in Thailand. Our 16-bit business was up 19.3% sequentially in the March quarter, as our business recovered sharply from the inventory correction many of our customers went through over the last 3 quarters. For fiscal year '12, our 16-bit business was up 5.9% as compared to fiscal year '11. Despite the broad-based market weakness over the last year, our strong design momentum enabled us to overcome the macro trend and significantly outgrow the market. After 5 consecutive quarters of targeted double-digit growth, including a 33.7% sequential growth in the December quarter, our 32-bit microcontroller business took a pause in the March quarter as some customers digested the inventory they had built. As a result, the 32-bit business was down 13.7% sequentially, although it was still up 51% from the year-ago quarter. For fiscal year '12, our 32-bit microcontroller business grew 104.7% as compared to fiscal year '11, the fastest growth of any 32-bit supplier by a long shot. The number of 32-bit customers and volume production grew to 885 as we continue to build a broad base of customers to grow this business. Moving to development tools. We shipped over 50,400 development tools in the March quarter, a new record for quarterly shipments. Cumulatively, we've now shipped close to 1.3 million development tools. Development tools sales remain an excellent leading indicator of continued strong design-in activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers. Gartner Dataquest just released the general purpose microcontroller market share report for 2011. While we remained in the #2 position for 8-bit microcontrollers, we continue to gain share versus the 8-bit market at large, and versus our nearest competitors. We closed the gap versus the #1 supplier and increased our distance versus the #3 supplier from a year ago. A year ago, it took the combination of 3 Japanese semiconductor giants, NEC, Hitachi and Mitsubishi, to knock us off the #1 spot for 8-bit microcontrollers. We assured you at the time that we would work relentlessly to gain market share, to wrest back the #1 spot in the coming years. We delivered in the first installment of that promise in 2011 with more to come this year. In the general purpose 16-bit microcontroller market, we were the fastest-growing 16-bit microcontroller supplier among the top 10 suppliers in 2011. While we remain in the #8 spot in 2011 for 16-bit microcontroller, we're well within striking distance of the next 2 spots ahead of us. In the general purpose 32-bit microcontroller market, we moved from the #19 spot in 2010 to #15 spot in 2011. And once again, we were the fastest-growing 32-bit microcontroller franchise. Now Gartner Dataquest report is a backward-looking indicator where we are, of course, performing very well. Now let's look -- take a look at the forward-looking indicator. Within the last month, EE Times released the results of their annual Embedded Market Study. Once again, Microchip was rated by embedded system design engineers as their #1 choice for new designs using 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the segment of the market we serve. We're honored by the overwhelming preference for our solutions and see this as a positive sign for future growth, especially for our 32-bit microcontroller franchise, where many of you have had questions about our choice of core. Our 2011 market results, as well as the 2012 design engineering preference results, echo market confirmation of our belief that what customers care about is that we offer a PIC microcontroller solution with all the attendant brand promises and that the choice of core is not as important. Now let's move to our analog products. Our analog business was up 0.7% sequentially and performed well in the current environment. For fiscal year '12, our analog business was down 3.8% as compared to fiscal year '11 due to the broad-based inventory correction, although it has performed considerably better than our peer group of competitors. We remain pleased with the design win momentum our analog business has shown and have a strong pipeline of innovative new products that we will be unveiling over the next year. Moving to our memory business. This business is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash memory products, and the business was flat on a sequential basis. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Before I hand off to Steve, I'd like to spend a few minutes on 2 smaller tuck-in acquisitions of private companies that we completed in the last 3 months. Both acquisitions are consistent with our overall strategy and aligned with our vision to be the very best embedded control solutions company. Our first acquisition completed last quarter was a Munich, Germany-based company called Ident, that has developed advanced gesture recognition solutions. Gesture recognition we believe is the next emerging technology in human interface solutions and builds upon our strengths in proximity, touch sense and touchscreen human interface solutions for the embedded market. Our second acquisition completed 2 weeks ago was a Los Gatos, California-based company called Roving Networks. Roving Networks is an innovator in easy-to-use low-power embedded WiFi and Bluetooth solutions that expands the range of our embedded wireless solutions. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012, which I will refer to as March quarter and then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2013, which I will refer to as June quarter. Our March quarter results were consistent with what we had guided during the last earnings call. The March quarter was a transitional quarter for us as we return to growth in revenue, gross margin percentage and profits. We went into this cycle one quarter earlier than most, and we had predicted that we would also come out of this cycle a quarter earlier than most. The December quarter was a bottom for us and we saw growth in our March quarter. Just one comment on the Licensing business that Ganesh did not discuss. The Licensing business was down 7.6% sequentially. This business tends to trail the semiconductor industry cycle, and our March quarter results reflects some of the broader weaknesses seen by the industry, with the industry returning to growth as forecasted by foundries and integrated device manufacturers alike. We expect our Licensing business to follow suit. In the interim, we continue to build a strong foundation for future growth, with 2 new significant license agreements signed in the March quarter. Overall, the March quarter turned out to be in line with our expectations in an otherwise seasonally weak period impacted by the Lunar New Year holidays in Asia. We grew 3% sequentially in revenue. Our gross margin percentage improved by 133 basis points sequentially. Our operating profit was up by 7.6% sequentially, and operating profit percentage was 31.9% of sales. Not too bad for the transitional quarter and it gets better from here. I will now provide guidance for the June quarter. Our guidance is based on the recovery continuing to take place from the bottom of December quarter. We expect our net sales in the June quarter to be up 3% to 7% sequentially. We expect another 100 basis points pickup in the non-GAAP gross margin percentage, with the gross margin in the range of 59% to 59.25%. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be about 26.25% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating profit to be between 32.75% to 33% of sales, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.47 to $0.49 per share. As you compare our June guidance with our peer group, some other's June guidance may look stronger. But if you compare the results for the March quarter and June guidance as cumulative, our performance is near the top of the growth. Please keep in mind that individual companies have different end market exposures and distribution sales and recognition policies that can affect the trajectory and timing of their revenue decline and subsequent growth. The industry's distribution inventory is very low. As that inventory is rebuilt, the sell-in companies see the revenue immediately while the sell-through companies like Microchip will see them delayed. Therefore, our June guidance should be put in perspective based on these factors.  We still expect to reach 60% gross margin by the end of this fiscal year without the effect of the acquisition announced today. On a longer-term basis, with the low amount of new capital, continuing to shut off all depreciation, a gradual ramp in the production of our factories, as inventories burned off, ongoing die shrinks and other cost reductions, we will start to work the gross margin back up towards the corporate target of about 61% on a non-GAAP basis. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisition, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results will provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. Finally, the March quarter was our 86th consecutive profitable quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 58.1% and non-GAAP operating profit of 31.9% are the type of results that are not achieved by most of our competitors even in the best of times. We feel very positive and confident about the long-term prospects in our business and are continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives to drive growth. With that, operator, would you please poll for questions?
Operator: Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: First of all, Steve, thanks for taking the time and being the first on the -- warning how the industry is going to go [indiscernible] of the recovery. A question for you. As you see bookings, which you commented on the press release as continuing to be good, are there any areas that are kind of fallen behind and if you can comment on what you're seeing regionally, especially in Europe where people are always concerned about declining PMI? So if you can just give some color regionally what you're seeing? I know you don't talk about end market but to the extent that you have any insight on end markets as well, may you can give us some commentary there?
Steve Sanghi: Well, bookings were quite strong last quarter around the world by region, including Europe. Europe was actually up the most last quarter, if you see, and the exact number was...
J. Eric Bjornholt: 14.5%.
Steve Sanghi: 14.5%. Europe is seasonal in that way. We get most of the growth in Europe in the March quarter and then Europe is seasonally very weak in December quarter and the summer quarter, September and June is kind of so-so. So Europe is very seasonal and we're basically seeing that seasonal trend. And on the top of that, whatever happens in the Eurozone, we certainly will not be immune from that effect, but the business in Europe seems fine right now.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Separately, let me just ask you, are there speculation around MIPS and MIPS going to find and buy and decide that your 32-bit is designed around MIPS. To what extent is that going to be a challenge if they're acquired by a competitor, for example? Would you continue to support that architecture or is it easy for you to switch from MIPS to something else? I'm not sure how that works for you but any comment here on what the future of that company may have with regards to 32-bit architecture would be helpful?
J. Eric Bjornholt: We always don't want to speculate on what is or is not going on there. We have always maintained that the core is not the critical element of what the solution we deliver is. We've always been clear, it's a PIC32, which has a substantial number of other benefits to the customer that define what value it is to them. So if and when whatever plays out, we'll play out our hand at that time. But right now, there's no change in our strategy.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And can I just ask, I mean, I know Steve, we're going to talk about SMSC in another call. But as I look at all the small acquisitions you've made, gesture recognition seems a little bit some R&D-intensive, how do you see applying that technology to your target markets, this is implying expansion into high-volume applications that you have typically shied away from? And I ask this because we're looking at gesture recognition as something that we'll use more in consumer devices. So how does this fit in with your strategy when you acquired Hampshire Technology and that was going to be focused on less high-volume areas?
Steve Sanghi: So if you look at history, we have always been able to take this technology and move into the broader market. So when you looked at our touch screen and buttons and sliders and touch focus, you saw how we have built substantial business in appliances, in automotive, in touch panels, in industrial and on and on and those kind of stuff, without really making a very large portion of our business in consumer devices, fast moving, fast life cycles and all that. So similarly, as we acquire these technologies, there's a substantial need for all of these technologies in the broad base of the markets that Microchip serve. and as Microchip continues to get larger and larger and we'll get to talk about the other acquisition in the next hour, there's certainly room for some portion of our business in the high-volume faster markets without really overall disturbing Microchip's margin model. So gesture recognition takes the touch screen experience to the next level. Later on tomorrow, I'm presenting to a communication meeting to Microchip's worldwide employees. And the PC that I'm going to be using, I can wave my head and move the slides forward or backward from a distance. That's the technology I'm going to be using and introducing to our employees, and I will try to do the same thing next time I present to the investors so you can get a feel for that technology.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And just finally, on series of acquisitions. I mean, ZeroG, you did acquire ZeroG in embedded wireless and I'm just wondering where Roving fits with regards to ZeroG, does supersede or complement that acquisition? I'm just trying to understand how part of this wireless technology is going to fit into your strategy? That's my last question.
J. Eric Bjornholt: It obviously, complements what we have with ZeroG. ZeroG gave us a much lower end of product that was in the entry-level of where WiFi technologies we're at. We get some higher-end technologies. We have some Bluetooth capabilities now that come to us from Roving, and there's some substantial application expertise that comes with it as well. So all of these continue to build our capabilities in the areas of WiFi and Bluetooth, both of which we believe are ubiquitous and the kinds of building block technologies that are in use in a broad range of applications across the market segments we serve.
Operator: We'll take our next question from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk broadly about the competitive trends you're seeing in the microcontroller market. I know it's always competitive and there's always pricing pressure. But have you seen any of your competitors be more aggressive, especially on pricing? And do you see any of your competitors kind of struggling to make it in the market currently?
Steve Sanghi: The microcontroller market has lots of different competitors in 8, 16 and 32. There's a long tail of about 20-plus competitors in each of those markets. There are always few people gaining market share. There's never a single person in any time you compare people, one could look faster growing for a period of time than the others, but there are a handful of 4, 5 people gaining market share in many of these markets. But there's a long tail to take market share from and especially Microchip whose business is spread in 70,000 customers, we often gain market share from the tail. And a lot of the investors and analysts focus sometime, tends to be kind of on the top, Atmel, and TI, and Renesas, and STMicro, they're all doing well. And you could compare them all you like. But if you look at the data year after year after year, when we look at our performance versus the industry average shipments, whether you look at SIA, where we overall gained market share last year from 6.5% to 7.5%, or you look at the Dataquest numbers that Ganesh pointed or you look at the EE Times survey in brand preference, we continue to win in every indicator consistently for 20-plus years, looking back and looking forward. Microcontroller market has always been competitive. People come and go. There's nobody bombing that market, destroying the prices, in microcontrollers it just does not work, it's a designmen kind of business. And anybody fading away, you could just look at the ranking, there are plenty people fading away from the bottom.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the geographic color. Can you talk about what's happening in Asia? Clearly, Lunar New Year is a seasonally weak quarter but what -- how do you to expect that to track in the June quarter?
Steve Sanghi: In June quarter, Asia should be very strong. It should be the strongest geography, both separately in China and broader Asia.
Operator: We'll take our next question from JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: I just had a question on the order front. So obviously, with your sell-through accounting, you're not going to pick it up in revenues, so perhaps on the order front, that would be a useful leading indicator. Can you give us a sense of what you think is happening on orders in terms of end demand versus inventory refill driving those for you guys?
Steve Sanghi: So as Eric pointed out, our distribution inventory ended the March quarter with a 10-year low. And it's just inevitable that distribution will replenish some of that inventory this quarter and in the coming quarters. So if anybody's concerned about Microchip's internal inventory being high, and last quarter, it was flat, but there was a substantial reduction last quarter in the distribution inventory. And if distribution had not gone down that much, then our inventory would have dropped. So we always look at the total. On total basis, the inventory dropped. So as the distribution refills it, it will drop Microchip's internal inventory and the distribution is fairly positive going forward. So I think that's the trend. I don't know if that answers your question.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: That's really helpful. And then sometimes, you're able to give us a sense of what your larger customers are doing that you talked directly with versus the distributors. Are you seeing any difference in their behavior right now? Any difference in order patterns?
Steve Sanghi: Well, so our -- what we call direct OEM backlog, the customers that we shipped to directly and not through distribution was up strongly starting in the quarter for this coming quarter.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: And is there any difference between your analog order pattern versus your microcontroller pattern at this point?
Steve Sanghi: Not substantial to report. We don't break it out, but it's not something that pops out. I think we're doing pretty good across the product line.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And if I could squeeze in one last. On the gross margin front, so obviously, that's moving up. Is it primarily utilization or is there mix also that could help gross margin?
Steve Sanghi: It's really a combination of factors. It's a handful of moving parts. This continuously -- depreciation is going down with low capital investment. It's continuously mix is becoming richer as memory business is getting smaller as a portion of the overall and microcontrollers and analog licensing have seen more of a growth. It's the die shrinks and all that kind of stuff, general cost reduction in the industry. As the inventory goes down, the factories have a gradual ramp, although we have not increased the factory utilization yet. From December quarter to March quarter, there was some natural improvement because the holidays and all that were not there. And in the June quarter also, the holidays of early January are not there. So there is some improvement in the factory utilization. So a handful of moving parts. We're talking about 100 basis points improvement with 6 factors probably.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.
Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: I just want to kind of circle back on JoAnn's question there a little bit as she kind of preempted me. But the 10-year inventory at the -- excuse me, inventory at a 10-year low, with signs of cycle putting in the bottom in the March quarter, I'm just curious what you think was driving that when the cycle was about to turn up? And when do you think those distributors are finally going to put some orders back on you?
Steve Sanghi: The distributors have put the orders on us. So the backlog is much healthier than it was before, and it will continue to strengthen. The bookings are fairly strong, so the backlog is building by the week.
J. Eric Bjornholt: And Brendan, our lead times are very short, have remained short. Some of the strategic inventories that we have built is there. So people have been able to place orders and get them in fairly short period of time.
Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess the other question is you made some comments about your analog. But cumulatively, obviously, it compares very well with your analog peers. I'm just wondering what you're seeing in analog in general as the cycle begins to turn up here in the June quarter?
Steve Sanghi: So I think analog business should do very well in June quarter. I do not want to quantify it, but I think we should have a strong performance in the analog in June quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Chris Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Steve, I'd just be curious as to your thoughts or impression as to how you think this cycle will play out? I mean, clearly, you guys are undershipping in demand or shipping in demand across some of these [ph]. When do you think we get back to the proper run rate? And what do you think it's going to take to get us back there? Any thoughts on the timing of that?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the cyclic part of the recovery is underway. It's been a classic pattern where we call it first, which we called it back in the June timeframe last year. Everybody jumps in claiming to be an internal Microchip problem. A quarter later, warnings come from everybody and the industry joins. And then the speculation begins, when does the cycle end? Microchip's bottom quarter was December. We called that, too, that we end one quarter early, and that is often questioned. And now, it starts to get believed as that becomes a reality and everybody else called their March quarter as a bottom and then June quarter guidance is up. So it's a very classic pattern. And I think over the next couple of quarters, you should see a number of companies, at least the good companies, making new highs in terms of record revenues, taking out acquisitions and all the economic activities. So I think the pattern is pretty much intact.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And you mentioned that you're already seeing distis having to take their inventory up a little bit. So are your bookings from the distributors a little bit stronger than the OEM/contract manufacturers?
Steve Sanghi: I think our bookings are really strong across the board right now. So -- and it's region by region, so I'd be guessing if I answer that right now.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Sure. And my last question is probably for Eric. You guys are guiding for a nice sequential increase in sales this quarter, but your OpEx looks like it's up about the same amount as sales. Is that because of the 2 small acquisitions you did? And then how are you guys going to get that OpEx down towards the target model as the fiscal year unfolds?
Steve Sanghi: I think -- let me answer that instead of Eric. If you look at our OpEx, it's near the industry best. The industry spends several hundred basis points more than we do on an average basis, we'll be in the top 3, 4 companies, the top echelon. So we have seen a lot of opportunities in the market with these acquisitions and other internal programs, and people get awfully excited about trying to get another 25 basis points leverage. I mean, we just reported 31.9% operating profit and will be higher than that in the June quarter. And when the opportunity is there, if we did not invest in those strategic investments to gain share with these tuck-in acquisitions and internal programs to accelerate various revenue growth, we wouldn't be making over 32% operating profit, a kind of shame on us. That's the real answer.
J. Eric Bjornholt: And I guess, I'll just also point out that our long-term model is 25% to 26%.
Steve Sanghi: Yes. So we're just 25 basis points higher than that, we will be getting in the range as the recovery picks up steam.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Steve, realizing that 32-bit is still a very small portion of the overall microcontroller market. Down this quarter, do you expect to see a resumption of growth in the June quarter? And relative to the 16-bit ramp, is this kind of lumpiness kind of typical as you're starting out a new node?
Steve Sanghi: So I would predict that we will grow in the June quarter in 8, 16, 32, analog, across the board.
J. Eric Bjornholt: I think if you go back and look at the 16-bit by quarter patterns, we haven't had a timeline where occasionally, there's going to be a quarter when there is a decline, and that was there if you go back over to the first 20, 30 quarters of how the 16-bit did, it's not unusual at this stage. But if you look at the consistent longer-term pattern of the growth and you're going to find multiple quarters of growth, and there'll be a pause somewhere along the way.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then guys, as you think about the different segments of microcontrollers, I'm kind of curious, relative to the overall growth in microcontrollers, how do you see 16 versus 32? And I know you're dealing with different basis [indiscernible], but I'm most interested in kind of the 8-bit market and what you think the longer-term growth there is? It seems like the 8-bit downturn starts a little bit earlier than the overall semiconductor downturn?
Steve Sanghi: We have -- in our history, we have really never cared about that. We always look at what our market share is. If our market share is 15% in any given market, then the 85% of the business we don't have. We don't let our people think that this particular market is shrinking or this particular market is growing. If you look at our 20-year performance in the 8-bit market, we have done incredible in the face of the market that analysts have called it for better part of 10 years as not a good market. 16-bit is the same way. Everybody says all the growth is in 32-bit. We have doubled year after year after year in 16-bit and grew again last year significantly. So it's just a different thinking. We don't think in terms of market growth. We think in terms of the opportunities that we can have in growing that market. So if it grows to market share and the market isn't growing, so be it. We don't make the difference.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then Steve, my last question, maybe a bit tangential to the 9:30 call, but the dividend has always been sort of a key part of the Microchip story and you guys have always been very committed to it. Just given the size of the acquisition announced this morning, as I run the numbers, doesn't seem to be any issue with the dividend strategy but I thought I'd just like to hear from you.
Steve Sanghi: So you're correct and the question is valid for this call, too. There will be no change in our dividend strategy, we've got substantial amount of cash and we established a larger credit line last year to really fund this so there's no problem, here. Dividend strategy will continue.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I wonder if you could -- it's a difficult question, given the breadth of your customer line, but give some indication of what you think your customers are doing and end customers are doing with inventory levels right now? Do you -- in terms of how lean those inventories may be and their willingness to perhaps start to do some restocking here, independent of what's happening at the distributors?
Steve Sanghi: So if you look at the direct customers, it's quite clear. As I mentioned, the direct customers backlog started out much stronger and additional bookings are continuing. So we feel pretty good about it. And part of that across the customer base has to be where they're seeing resurgence in their business or the inventory is too low or a combination of both.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Right. I mean, I guess as a follow-on to that, from a bigger picture perspective, you obviously have a lot of customers but I'm sure you speak a lot of customers, what are they telling you, from a bigger picture standpoint, of their confidence through the rest of the year?
Steve Sanghi: Their businesses are doing better. They have bounced off the bottom. They're more confident that economic cycle is doing better. But they're not happy that the economic cycle is the weakest recovery it's been seen in many, many recessions. The latest slowdown in GDP in the March quarter, which was lower, is not a happy news. So nobody is really pleased with the pace of the recovery, nor are we. But everybody is still seeing growth, at least it has turned positive, and they're doing better than they were doing before.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And just one final. You had talked a bit about what you're doing with your inventories and such. I believe the way that you were managing utilization was taking factory shutdowns, are you planning on continuing the shutdowns into the June quarter?
Steve Sanghi: No, we did not have any shutdown in the March quarter either, although there is some natural shutdown. The New Year holiday kind of goes a little bit into January, early part of January. But there are no more factory shutdowns required because our inventory, when you combine it together with the distribution, it's dropping already.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Stephens.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: First question, Steve, Microcontroller business was up 5.5%, which is better. I understand that you're recovering from some natural disaster kind of issues. But I'm curious if there was any one market or 2 markets that stood out that did better than the others? And I'm also curious if you saw increasing strength in orders. In other words, how is the linearity of orders?
Steve Sanghi: So you want to take the Microcontroller, please?
J. Eric Bjornholt: Sure. Our business is very broad-based. There's no specific market that's been driving the resurgence in the growth. It's growth across the board. And I forgot, what was the second question?
Steve Sanghi: Second part question was the linearity of the orders. So basically, the business has continued to strengthen through the March quarter. So bookings, higher and higher every month, and we expect that pattern to continue in April, and then May is just starting so basically, it's a very classic pattern. The bookings are strengthening.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Very good. And as a follow-up, Steve, last decade, this is a strategic question. Microchip, from what I remember covering you guys, was not a very big fan of acquisitions. This sort of decade so far, we've seen a different pattern. And I'm curious if there's a change in the way you guys are thinking about running the business going forward as you get -- are you trying to get more acquisitive? Or is it a function of what you're able to see in the marketplace that's very cheap? Just any thoughts?
Steve Sanghi: Well, kind of thoughtful question. So if you look at -- the question really depends on what you do with your cash. So we produce enormous amount of cash and relatively low capital investment in the business. So the business is very profitable and throws a lot of cash. So we spent the last decade building up our dividend to be near 4%, one of the highest dividend in the semiconductor industry. And that's good, giving -- on the top of that more even is really not helpful. It gets kind of too high and I don't think people start to appreciate beyond that when it's already the highest. So the other is the investment in our own business, where growth in strategic initiatives. There was the earlier question regarding the operating expenses and not as quick to get it down to 25%, 25.5%. There is an opportunity we're investing and we're happy with it, our business is very profitable. But despite giving all this dividend and despite spending 26.25% on operating expenses, slightly higher than the model, we're still building cash. We've got $1.8 billion record cash. So what do we do with it? So we're looking for where we can find acquisitions that can enhance Microchip's available market, maybe to similar customers where we sell their products that go around the board, things that we could package in with Micro where it can really add to strategic initiatives, either in technology, all the market, all the products or all of the above. We didn't have that level of cash in the earlier part of last decade. We were also building our factory infrastructure at that time. If you recall, we spent a couple of hundred million dollars buying our fab floor in Oregon, and subsequently made substantial capital investments for equipment and all that. We built a factory in Thailand and added significant to that. So we were building our infrastructure and spending money internally. All that is now built and we have substantial factory capacity in our factories plus part of the fab-lite strategy where we are doing a portion of the business at the foundries. So business has become less capital-intensive in this decade. And therefore, we are trying to find use for that money and doing it very judiciously. We haven't done a bad acquisition. The record of acquisitions in our industry is terrible and ours is great. Acquisition after acquisition, we are very, very pleased with it. It's adding shareholder value.
Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Great. So I should think of your strategy for using cash is basically kind of expanding your product line, expanding your footprint. But that's where you cut off the line, correct?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. I mean, unless there's a fourth element of it and there's capital investment, there is internal growth in operating expenses, growth in operating expenses, we don't like, and 26% versus 26%, I'm not shedding tears. The capital expense, we are spending what we need to spend and it is low because of our strategy. So that is fine. And despite doing all that, we are still building a lot of cash. So therefore, I hold the management at Microchip responsible and you should hold all of us responsible to make sure we don't blow that cash in bad acquisitions, a lot of people did at the height of the 2000 bubble and spending billions of dollars and then writing them off. We haven't done that at all, and we will not do that. And that's our promise to you, that if we do an acquisition, we will deliver tremendous shareholder value.
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I have a short question. Just if development tools are a good indicator of future revenue, can you give a little more of a breakout or at least growth rate of development tools for 32-bit controllers versus 16 or 8?
J. Eric Bjornholt: So our development tools are used across 8s, 16s and 32s. Yes, there are a subset of tools that are unique to 32 only. But there's a much larger number of tools that get used across 8s, 16s and 32s. I think the more meaningful indicators to look at, how are the businesses themselves growing, and if you look at 8s, 16s and 32s, they have continued to outperform the market and the development tools that our customer buys can be used on different projects and today, may help an 8-bit, tomorrow, may help a 16-bit, day after tomorrow, can help a 32-bit. But the fact that they're being purchased and used is a good reflection across our microcontroller portfolio.
Steve Sanghi: I would like to add that a part of the Microchip PIC brand value proposition is that we are the only company where if you buy a development tool, you can use it on our 900 products from 8 to 32. You cannot do that with any other company. Their product lines are disjointed where one is based on this architecture, the other was designed here, the pinouts and peripherals and others are not compatible, they don't match, so you have to buy different tools for different product lines. For Microchip, one tool set will serve the entire base.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. I guess that supports the reason different processors or cores don't really matter as long as the development tools are the same.
Steve Sanghi: Exactly, yes.
Operator: We'll take our final question today from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: It's probably a good segue into the call but Steve, to further clarify the acquisition strategy. It seems like you've been opportunistic in the past with the SSTI deal. A lot of the acquisitions have kind of fallen into that elbow out, but Ganesh just mentioned that it seems like you were alluding to the most recent acquisition, SMSC, as one that's more SAM expansion. So is that the right way to think about how you're looking at your acquisition strategy on a go-forward basis?
Steve Sanghi: So since you named the company we're buying, I'd rather take that question in the next call. And if it's not asked, I'll answer it anyway in the call. There are certain rules about filing and all that, so I'd rather not take that in this call.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: All right. On the Licensing business, you mentioned there were 2 deals that were signed in the quarter, in the March quarter that were meaningful. When do those kick in from a revenue standpoint? And will we see them impacting the growth rate of that business or is the cyclical dynamic that you mentioned just really the overriding factor in terms of how we think about the way that business rises and falls over time?
Steve Sanghi: So the new license is depending on what kind of days, whether it's an extension of something, or it's a major license or it's a brand new node and a major foundry. It could have 2 years to revenue. But there are milestone payments in between, there's payments usually at signing of the contract. Some of that we will get this quarter when you make the first package delivery, the technology in our delivery. But then as they start to install it, there's money at various steps. But in the royalty stream, actually, they're couple of years away. But there's a significant revenue in between. Okay. So with that, we'd like to finish the earnings portion of the call. So all of you have to sign into a different call. There's a different number that was sent out. And for the second call, I'll also be using a slide set, which was posted on the Web as we speak. So make sure you get that slide set.
J. Eric Bjornholt: It will be on the webcast.
Steve Sanghi: It will also be on the webcast. So we'll see many of you on the next call. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's earnings conference.

Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to this Microchip Technology Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
J. Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO; and Gordon Parnell, Vice President Business Development and Investor Relations. I will comment on our third quarter of fiscal year 2012 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP to non-GAAP results.  I will now go through some of the operating results. I will be referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of share base compensation and acquisition-related expenses. Net sales in December quarter were $329.2 million and were down sequentially 3.4% from net sales of $340.6 million in the immediately preceding quarter and were down 10.5% from net sales of $367.8 million in the December 2010 quarter. Looking at revenue by geography for the December quarter, Americas were down 3.4% sequentially, Europe was down 15.3% sequentially and Asia was up 1.9% sequentially. All geographies were impacted by the weak economic and industry conditions we experienced, with Asia being the strongest and Europe being the weakest as compared to our expectations.  Our non-GAAP results were in line with our quarterly guidance provided on November 3, 2011. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 56.8% in the December quarter, and non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.3% of sales. Operating income was 30.5% of sales, and net income was $85.4 million or $0.42 per diluted share.  On a full GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related intangible amortization, were 55.8% in the December quarter. Total operating expenses were $95.7 million or 29.1% of sales and includes share-based compensation of $8.6 million, acquisition-related expenses of $1.2 million and $0.7 million of special income associated with acquisitions from prior years. GAAP net income of $77.5 million or $0.38 per diluted share and was favorably impacted by $4.1 million of nonrecurring tax events. In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 12.7%, and the GAAP tax rate was 7.4% as a result of the nonrecurring tax events discussed earlier. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing businesses, gains or losses on trading securities and the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax-advantaged securities. We expect our combined forward-looking effective tax rate on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis to be about 12.5% to 13%.  To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the December quarter, share-based compensation was about $0.043, acquisition-related items were about $0.011, noncash interest expense was about $0.006 and the favorable tax event was about $0.02. The dividend declared today of $0.349 per share will be paid on March 6, 2012, to shareholders of record on February 21, 2012. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $67.1 million. Moving onto the balance sheet. Microchip's inventory at December 31 was $217.9 million or 137 days, up 5 days from the prior-quarter levels. The total combined inventory held either by Microchip or its distributors was down 6 days on a sequential basis. Inventory at our distributors was 35 days, which is down 11 days from the prior-quarter level. The change that we experienced in distribution inventory levels is that largest one quarter change we have ever experienced.  However, I remind you that our distribution revenues throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. At December 31, Microchip's accounts receivable balance was $149.3 million, an increase of 4.8% from the balance as of the end of December. Receivable balances continue to be in great condition with excellent payment performance from our customers.  As of December 31, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1.77 billion and was down $5.1 million from the prior-quarter levels. The significant reduction in distributor inventory holding levels negatively impacted our cash collections during the quarter. Our total cash and investment position is projected to grow by approximately $80 million to $90 million in the March quarter prior to our dividend payment.  Capital spending was $6.1 million for the December quarter and is expected to be about $68 million for fiscal 2012. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $21.5 million, which was down $0.5 million from the September quarter. Depreciation expense is projected to be about $21 million in the March quarter and about $86.5 million for fiscal 2012.  I want to remind investors and analysts that fluctuations in Microchip's share price impact the diluted shares outstanding used in our earnings per share calculations. The average share price of Microchip's stock in the December 2011 quarter was $34.75. Dilution from Microchip's outstanding convertible debentures occurs at average quarterly share prices above $28.21, which is the current conversion price.  We have updated the schedule on the supplemental financial information section of the Investor Relations page of our website that shows what the incremental share count from the convertible debt will be at various share prices. That should continue to be helpful to investors and analysts when trying to estimate the impact of share count increases on earnings per share.  Our financial guidance for the March 2012 quarter is based on an average Microchip share price of $38 to calculate the additional dilutive effect from the convertible debt. The negative impact on the earnings per diluted share calculation from the difference in the assumed average stock price for the March 2012 quarter compared to the actual share price in the December 2011 quarter is about $0.005 to $0.006. Inventors and analysts should refer to the table on our website if they want to model the diluted shares outstanding using a different weighted average share price for the quarter.  I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines. Let's start with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was down 4.4% on a sequential basis, with both 8-bit and 16-bit product lines down sequentially.  Our 16-bit business was down 5.4% sequentially as we experienced some short-term pushouts from customers in the computing segments who were affected by supply-chain issues stemming from the flooding in Thailand. For the first 9 months of fiscal year '12, our 16-bit business was 11.5% higher than the corresponding period in fiscal year '11, and we're expecting good growth in the March quarter as customer demand rebounds. We continue to retain the designs we had established, and we are securing many new design wins at new and existing customers.  Our 32-bit microcontroller business had another strong quarter of growth, up 33.7% on a sequential basis and up 137.3% from the year-ago quarter to achieve a new record. For the 9 months of fiscal year '12, our 32-bit business was 134.1% higher than the corresponding period in fiscal year '11, and we're again expecting strong growth in the March quarter. Despite the challenging environment, this product line continues to demonstrate growth as many new designs continue to go into production.  Our 32-bit results also reflect market confirmation of our belief that what customers care about is that if we -- is that we offer a PIC microcontroller solution with all the attendant brand promises, and that the choice of the core itself is not as important. The number of customers in volume production grew to 809, and we continue to build a broad base of customers to grow this business.  Over the last 12 to 18 months, we have been investing and accelerating the pace of new microcontroller product introductions, especially in the 16-bit and 32-bit space where our portfolio is not yet as rich as our 8-bit microcontroller portfolio. We expect that in the next 12 months we will bring to market over 150 new 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers as we expand our served available market and accelerate our market share gains over the next cycle.  Moving to development tools. We shipped over 43,100 development tools in the December quarter. Cumulatively, we have now shipped over 1.25 million development tools. Development tools sales remain an excellent leading indicator of continued strong design and activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers. Development tools get used by our customers for multiple projects over several years and as such, the continued trend of strong development tool sales bodes well for future growth.  Moving now to our analog products. Our analog business was up 1.75% sequentially and performed exceptionally well in the current environment. The strength of our analog business is due to 2 factors: one, the introduction of a steady stream of innovative new products that target a broad range of applications; and second, our strategy to focus not only on attaching to our microcontrollers, but also to other microcontrollers as well as other devices like DSPs, FPGAs and ASICs that require analog around them.  We remain pleased with the design win momentum our analog business has shown. We also have a number of significant new product announcements planned in the next few months, which we expect will drive strong revenue growth in the future.  Moving to our memory products. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash memory products, was down 6.6% on a sequential basis. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions.  With that, let me now pass it to Steve for his general comments as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the December 2011 quarter and then provide guidance for the March 2012 quarter.  Our December quarter results were consistent with what we had guided during our last earnings call. The thesis that we had described to the investors 2 quarters ago was that industry was going into a broad-based demand weakness and inventory correction. Our thesis has played out exactly as we have predicted. We explained to the investors and the analysts that we see the effect of industry events first. Microchip went into this correction a quarter before many of the others in the semiconductor industry. Since then, we have seen this sentiment get reflected in results coming from the early -- every semiconductor company to the earnings season.  Then in the last earnings call, we said that we saw December as the bottoming out quarter for the current cycle for Microchip. We are reconfirming our belief that December was a bottom quarter for this cycle, and we will begin to see a sequential revenue growth starting in the March quarter.  We went into this cycle one quarter earlier than most, and we will also come out of this cycle a quarter earlier than most. You have seen that many of the semiconductor companies missed their initial December quarter guidance, have guided down further for March quarter and have called the March quarter their bottom. For Microchip, the December quarter was our bottom, and we will grow in the March quarter.  Now when you start to compare calendar year 2011 to calendar year 2010, Microchip's results look favorable to the industry's results, particularly if you adjust for the acquisitions made by the other companies. Ganesh has commented on the product lines. I wanted to further highlight 3 product lines. 32-bit microcontrollers, with a 33.7% sequential growth, made a new record and was the star performer. Licensing with a 4.9% sequential growth also made a new record. While analog, with a 1.75% sequential growth, really bucked the trend with the industry down in double digits.  On the factory side, in our 2 fabs, we took some shut down days around Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year. As Eric reported, our total inventory at Microchip plus distributors combined went down by 6 days from its peak in September quarter. We continue to expect that the total inventory position will come down as the recovery further unfolds.  I will now provide guidance for the March 2012 quarter. Our guidance is based on recovery starting to take place from the inventory correction with December as a bottom quarter. We also have taken into account the effects of the Lunar New Year in Asia in the March quarter. We expect our net sales in the March 2012 quarter to be up 1% to 5% sequentially. As the holiday shutdowns are reversed from the March 2012 quarter, we will expect to see significant recovery in gross margin.  We expect the non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be between 57.75% to 58.25%, which is 125 basis points better than the December quarter. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be about 25.75% to 26.25% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating profit to be between 31.75% to 32.25% of sales, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.43 to $0.47 per share.  After 125 basis points improvement in gross margin in the March quarter, we will see further improvement in the subsequent quarters and expect to hit 60% non-GAAP gross margin by the end of fiscal year. On a longer-term basis, with the low amount of new capital continuing to shut off all depreciation, gradual ramp in factories as the inventories burned off and ongoing die shrinks and other cost reductions, we will start to work the gross margin back up towards the corporate target of about 61% on a non-GAAP basis.  Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges, sale of noncore businesses, gain and loss in public securities, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.  Finally, the December quarter was our 85th consecutive profitable quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 56.8% and the non-GAAP operating profit of 30.5% are the type of results that are not achieved by most of our competitors even in the best of times. We feel very positive and confident about the long-term prospects in our business and are continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives to drive growth.  With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Venkatesh Nathamuni - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is Venk Nathamuni for Chris Danely. My first question is how does -- you said you've lowered inventory, combined inventory of both the Microchip and the distributors. But how does inventory now compared to what it was during the 2008, 2009 downturn?
Steve Sanghi: Eric, I think you have some data on that.
J. Eric Bjornholt: Yes. So I mean, inventory went higher in the last downturn. Then when recoveries spiked up, it went down pretty significantly from there. But this is definitely not the high we've seen in inventory. I think we were at 143 or 144 days before and we're at 137 now.
Venkatesh Nathamuni - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then as my follow-up, you talked about recovery in orders. Is that in your opinion driven primarily by demand coming back, or is it more of an inventory restocking phenomenon that's going on?
Steve Sanghi: It is always a combination. The downside was both weak demand as well as inventory correction, and the recovery would really have both elements in it.
Operator: We'll go next to James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Realizing it's still very early post the Chinese or Lunar New Year, can you give us any kind of sense of color from your customers in terms of bookings levels after the Chinese New Year holiday versus the ones you were seeing in the rates in January before the holiday?
Steve Sanghi: I think Monday was the first day back from Chinese New Year, so we'll really get the first data point next week after one week is over. Right now, we basically have 2 or 3 days, so I don't really think there's any data yet.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, understand. And then on the white goods market, I think some of your peers have talked about somewhat mixed results out of that market in terms of the demand that they're seeing. And I think the retail results over Chinese New Year were also somewhat mixed. Can you talk about that vertical in particular for you?
Steve Sanghi: We can't break it down by vertical. Our customer mix is much, much broader than many other people who tend to sell into large verticals. We have 30,000, 40,000 plus customers in China, so we can't really break it down by vertical. But we do know, after looking at some large customers worldwide, our automotive business was slightly up last quarter, but all the others were down. And even the automotive was driven by really a couple of customers where we had some significant design wins during the tsunami period. But otherwise, there was really a broad-based weakness. As far as China or Asia was concerned, our business was up in Asia.
J. Eric Bjornholt: Yes. Our Far East business is up 1.9% sequentially.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I just wonder with respect to the gross margin and the gross margin improvement that you're expecting in the March quarter, what does that imply with respect to your own inventory levels and the channel inventory levels as we go forward? Do you plan to keep the inventory flattish from here? Or do you anticipate some replenishment going on going forward?
Steve Sanghi: So I think we don't really know what the distributors will do. We take the revenue only on what the distribution sell-through. So the distribution activity in a given quarter, on a sell-in basis, doesn't really impact our revenue, and we don't really care. Lead times are short. If they want to build inventory, we have the product available. If they don't want to build inventory, so be it. So what's really important is the combination of distributor inventory plus ours. If they hold more, we'll have less; if they hold less, we'll have more. And the combined distribution plus our inventory will do roughly what?
J. Eric Bjornholt: We expect it will be about flat in the March quarter.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. Great. And this is a follow-on, a clarification. I thought I heard you say back at the 61% gross margin rate by the end of the fiscal year. Just to confirm that my understanding is right. And if that's the case, what -- as you grow back to the 61% level, is that predicated on a certain revenue run rate level in order to get back to those level -- to that gross margin level?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, of course, it is but we're not going to tell you that. We're not going to tell you the number.
J. Eric Bjornholt: Just for clarification. So Steve's comments were that by the end of fiscal 2013, we would expect to be back at about the 60% non-GAAP gross margin range, and our long-term model of 61% hasn't changed.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: So 60% by the end of fiscal '13 non-GAAP and 61% eventually?
J. Eric Bjornholt: That's right.
Steve Sanghi: Because he was trying to triangulate the 61% means what kind of gross margin. Obviously, internally, we have a model, but it also depends on the mix of the product lines and mix of where the demand comes in. So it has lots of moving pieces. It's not going to constrain because various product lines have various different gross margins, but we have a model internally. And yes, it does tie to a revenue number.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: On the 32-bit results, can you say what applications were you winning the most with your 32-bit processor?
Ganesh Moorthy: What we have said before is we have a broad set of customers. We're at over 800 customers and a broad set of applications. We don't really detect a particular application or segment that is driving the strength. It's pretty broad-based in terms of 32-bit wins as well as our 32-bit revenue growth.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: How about the analog being up quarter-over-quarter far exceeding the market? Are they being tied to the same 32-bit controllers, or is it just a general lift that you're getting in the new product?
Ganesh Moorthy: A combination of both. Certainly, as we have strengthened our 32-bit, it does bring some analog alone. But the analog business is a larger business, and it clearly has strength in a number of areas that we have brought new products over the last 1 to 2 years that have gone to production. So it's also pretty broad-based in how it's driving growth.
Operator: We'll go next to Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.
Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: The inventory in the channel at 35 days, how does that compare to previous bottoms in the cycle?
J. Eric Bjornholt: So just the inventory over time is really ranged. It's had a broad range. It's been kind of low 30s to about 50 days. But if you look over the last 3 years, this is on the low end of where we've been at 35 days. So I would think that over time, distributors will do some restocking. But I don't know when that's going to happen, if that's going to be in March or quarters further out.
Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then the other question I have, some of your peers have noted a particular weakness out of China in the December quarter and also in the March quarter. I'm just curious what you're seeing in the Chinese market in particular?
Steve Sanghi: I think it's hard to talk about general. Some of the others, depending on what their revenue recognition is, was it the sell-in or the sell-through? And I've spoken about it in the last 2 or 3 conference calls. If the revenue recognition is sell-in, then it's happening what we told you, where the sell-in guys took a huge reduction of distribution inventory as the negative revenue. Microchip's distribution inventory went down significantly, but it doesn't affect our revenue because we are sell-through. That's why we went into this correction first, a quarter earlier than most, and we're coming out it before earlier than most. So our Asia business was up slightly while other people were down double digits because they were recognizing reduction in distribution inventory as the reduction in the revenue.
Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Understood. And my last question, if I look at the tax rate for fiscal '13, should we consider it staying more or less the 13% level?
J. Eric Bjornholt: Yes. It'll be in the general range that we are in the March quarter.
Operator: We'll go next to Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: The first question relates to a higher level of thinking on the business. It's been a while since you've added to the analog business, and obviously, there's some activity in the M&A market. I was wondering, I don't anticipate you to comment directly on your strategy, but I wanted you to comment on the proportioning of the business. And to what degree would having a little bit of a larger analog business perhaps helps with cross-selling microcontroller or memory?
Steve Sanghi: What activity are you talking about?
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Activity in terms of potential sales of activity. Genon [ph] recently was purchased. There are other activities for proposed sales of companies.
Steve Sanghi: So you're referring to the M&A activity in the market?
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Correct, yes.
Steve Sanghi: So if you lay out a chart of Microchip's analog growth over the last few years, you will see that we'll be nearly on the top of the list of analog company growth. You can compare that to the standalone analog companies which are in the $100 million to $300 million, $400 million, $600 million range, or you can even include the companies which have large analog business as part of the other large companies. So even at our size, we have done very well in introducing very good products, being able to acquire very good analog talent, having a pretty good strategic plan and executing it to really grow market share and do substantially better than the others. As far as the M&A is concerned, we continuously look at opportunities. As you know, in the analog business, we have acquired some companies in the past. If a good opportunity were to become available, we certainly would be interested. But we are not willing to pay the kind of premiums that you have seen in some recent M&A market. That's just not our style.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Very helpful. And then the second question I have is in regards to the timing of why Microchip sees either improvement or softness perhaps one quarter earlier than other companies. I know that you talk a lot about your operational excellence and lead times being so low that being a contributing factor. The question that I had is, to what degree does the programmability of your products enable distributors to more rapidly stock and destock your product? To what degree does that have a timing element versus other companies with fixed hardwire solutions that have much longer skew tails?
Steve Sanghi: So I don't think that's a significant factor because the distribution stocking or destocking doesn't affect our revenue. We don't take that as revenue. The biggest effect, and I've seen this earlier, is because we are 100% sell-through around the world and our competitors are sell-in. So that's the largest difference. When the distributor stocks it, it makes the revenue higher. When they destocks it, it makes the other people's revenue lower. Stocking and destocking has no effect on Microchip's business. It only has the effect on the inventory. It has no effect on revenue. Our revenue is driven by demand creation and distributors selling out. Now programmability makes it easier, makes our products more desirable. It has many other positive effects on the market, but being able to see it early is probably not as much one of them.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan.
Harsh N. Kumar - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division: Steve, you talked about a fiscal gross margin target of 60% and on longer-term, 61%. I'm curious if you could elaborate on what the biggest factors are that would play into that thinking?
Steve Sanghi: So I think some of the factors are obviously the factory utilization. We took a number of shutdown days last quarter because inventory levels were high and the business was weak and the distribution was destocking. So when the distribution was destocking, we were running our factories lower. But longer-term, there are a number of factors playing. So number one, the factories will go to full production as the factories ramp. That has probably the single largest effect on incremental gross margin. We're also continuing to shut off all the depreciation. So in our factories, with our business model, we use the equipment for many, many years after the equipment is fully depreciated. So that has a positive impact on gross margin. We're adding a low amount of new capital. So that, again, there's a less amount of incremental depreciation being added. And there are ongoing die shrinks as we take the products to more advanced technologies and other cost reductions and yields and all that. So those are really the main factors. The other factor is the product mix, but I think that's fairly slow moving, where you could have product lines which have better gross margin than the others. And over long term, you don't really know which one is going to grow more than the other, and they could have minor deviation in overall gross margin, the effect of those product mixes. So I think those are the number of factors which we're driving.
Harsh N. Kumar - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division: Got it, Steve. And there's a lot of -- there's some fair bit of thinking that because communication and industrial businesses in general, not yours, but the industry as such got hammered last year towards the end, that they would spike back up a little bit better than most. I'm curious if you could, may be not give numbers, but if you could just give us your sense of exposure to those areas, that's comm and industrial?
Steve Sanghi: We don't really have any breakout by segment -- by industry segment. So we don't really break our business internally by how much is industrial, how much is communication. In the kind of products we sell, it's exactly the same Microchip product that could go into industrial application, the same product could go into a commercial application. And same large customers may have divisions that are building industrial products and other divisions that are building commercial thermostats. And so it's impossible for us to track it. Sometimes we buy it as one-line item and use it in both, so therefore, we don't really break our business that way. We don't look at our business that way.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Okay. Thanks for attending the call. We are heading to a conference. I think Eric Bjornholt will be at the Stifel conference coming up, and we'll see some of you on the non-deal [ph] road shows that we often go from time to time and there are some planned this quarter. So thank you very much. Bye-bye.
Operator: And again, that does conclude today's call. We do appreciate everyone's participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip Technology Second Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
J. Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO; and Gordon Parnell, Vice President Business Development and Investor Relations. I will comment on our second quarter of fiscal year 2012 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relation page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results. I will be referring to gross margin and operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of share base compensation and acquisition-related expenses.  Net sales in the September quarter were $340.6 million, and were down sequentially 9.1% from net sales of $374.5 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and were down 10.9% from net sales of $382.3 million in the September 2010 quarter.  Looking at revenue by geography for the September quarter, Americas were down 9.4% sequentially, Europe was down 8.5% sequentially and Asia was down 9.2% sequentially. All geographies were impacted by the business conditions we experienced with Asia being the weakest as compared to our expectations. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.2% in the September quarter, and non-GAAP operating expenses were 25.9% of sales. Operating income was 32.3% of sales, and net income was $92.6 million or $0.46 per diluted share.  On a full GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related intangible amortization were 57.2% in the September quarter. Total operating expenses were $97.4 million or 28.6% of sales, and includes share-based compensation of $7.9 million and acquisition-related expenses of $1.1 million. GAAP net income was $79.3 million, or $0.40 per diluted share. In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 12.9%, and the GAAP tax rate was 12.2%. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business, gains or losses on trading securities and a percentage of our cash that is invested in tax advantage securities. We expect our combined forward-looking effective tax rate on both the GAAP and non-GAAP bases to be about 12.75% to 13.25%. To summarize the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the September quarter, share-based compensation was about $0.041, acquisition-related items were about $0.014, losses on trading securities was about $0.006 and noncash interest expense was about $0.006. The dividend declared today of $0.348 per share will be paid on December 5, 2011, to shareholders of record on November 21, 2011. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $66.7 million. Moving on to the balance sheet. Microchip's inventory at September 30, 2011, was $211.2 million or 132 days, up 13 days from the prior quarter level. Inventory at our distributors was 46 days, which is up 3 days from the prior quarter level. We continue to see an increasing trend of large OEM customers using distribution to hold bonded inventory on their behalf, in order to achieve 0 lead times without having to carry inventory on their balance sheets. This has resulted in a general increase over time in the amount of inventory our distributors carry. However, I remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis.  At September 30, Microchip's accounts receivables balance was $142.4 million, a decrease of 27.4% from the balance as of the end of June. The decrease in receivables was driven by the sequential revenue decline and differences in the shipment linearity between the June and September quarters. Receivable balances continue to be in great condition, with excellent payment performance from our customers. As of September 30, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1.78 billion, and was up $58.1 million from the prior quarter levels. Our total cash and investment position is projected to grow by approximately $75 million to $85 million in the December quarter, prior to our dividend payment.  Capital spending was $25.2 million for the September quarter, and is expected to be about $70 million for fiscal year 2012. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $22 million, which was flat to the June quarter. Depreciation expense in the December quarter is projected to be $21.6 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments in the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines. Our microcontroller business was down 11.2% on a sequential basis, with both 8-bit and 16-bit product lines down sequentially. Our 16-bit business was down 14.9% sequentially, and about flat for the year ago quarter. Reflective of the overall environment, our existing 16-bit customers were adjusting their inventory, while new customers were more cautious with their end product launches. We continue to retain the designs we have, and we're continuing to secure many new design wins at new and existing customers. Our 32-bit microcontroller business had another strong quarter of growth, up 10.4% on a sequential basis, and up 158.2% from the year-ago quarter to achieve a new record. Despite the challenging environment, this product line continues to demonstrate growth, as sufficient new designs go into production that more than offset the cautiousness of existing customers.  The number of customers in volume production grew sequentially from 657 to 790, as we continue to build a broad base of customers to grow this business. Moving to development tools. We shipped over 43,000 development tools in the September quarter. Cumulatively, we have now shipped over 1.2 million development tools, 30% of which were shipped in just the last 2 years. In addition to the development tools that Microchip ships, we have also licensed our tools to be built locally in several countries where import duties are high, as well as cultivated an extensive ecosystem of over 100 development tool partners, who extend our reach even further with the development tools that they develop and ship. Each development tool sold can get used for multiple projects over many years, and therefore, cumulative development tools sold is reflective of broad acceptance of our solutions by our customers.  Finally, we shipped our 10 billionth cumulative microcontroller in September to Samsung Electronics in South Korea. The shipment was for a Samsung product that utilized our 32-bit microcontroller, the PIC32, exemplifying the continued acceptance and design win of the PIC32 by leading global brand names like Samsung Electronics.  The 10 billionth microcontroller shipment milestone also exemplifies the trust placed in us by over 70,000 customers worldwide, as we endeavor to enable their innovation, and it also exemplifies the collective contribution by our worldwide teams over many, many years. Moving now to our analog business. This business was down only 0.7% sequentially, and performed exceptionally well in the current environment. The strength of the business reflects our strategy to focus not only on attaching to our microcontrollers, but also to other microcontrollers as well as other devices like DSPs, FPGAs and ASICs that require analog around them. We remain pleased with a design momentum our analog business has shown, and we expect to -- we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new products, which we expect will contribute to strong revenue growth in the future. Now moving to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash memory products. This business is down 12.6% on a sequential basis. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions.  Let me now comment on the Microchip Thailand operations. So this is an update to the press release that you saw last week. As you have no doubt seen in the news, Thailand is experiencing the worst flooding that they have experienced in over 50 years. The flooding has predominantly been north of Bangkok, where most of the tragic loss of life and extensive damage to factories has occurred. Over the last week, many locations within the city of Bangkok were also flooded. Our heartfelt sympathy and concern goes out to the people of Thailand and our employees who have been impacted by these floods.  We operate 2 assembly and test factories in Thailand that are located about 50 miles east of Bangkok. We have more than 3,000 employees in Thailand, over 200 of whom have had their homes flooded. The safety of our team in Thailand remains our #1 priority, and we continue to take steps to ensure their safety. Both of our factories have continued to operate normally, and thanks to the heroic actions of our local team, who have braved personal challenges in order to keep our operations running and our customers served. The primary international airport we use for logistics remains open, and our shipping and receiving is operating normally.  Now Microchip recognized the risk of flooding when we decided to set up operations in Thailand 15 years ago. We believe that the best insurance would be flood-prevention, and therefore, we invested in risk mitigation by planning for and investing in a project called Noah's Ark to protect against a 500-year flood. Noah's Ark consists of a dike that is 3.22 meters above sea level that surrounds our property, 9 pumps capable of pumping 10 million liters per hour of water out of the property, and generators plus fuel to run the pumps for over 2 weeks in the event electricity is lost. Additionally, the Microchip Thailand factory itself, the factory floor, is 3.6 meters above sea level, giving us another foot above the height of the dike. To date, the water levels in the canals around our factories have stayed in control, and certainly has not risen anywhere close to threatening our property, and we have not needed the Noah's Ark pumps to be used to expel any water. However, the pumps have been extensively tested, and we are battle-ready should it be necessary. Our subcontractor supply chain in Thailand has, however, been impacted. Although we have worked alternative solutions to just about all the issues. Our subcontractor, HANA, located in Ayutthaya, which is in the north of Bangkok, is underwater, and out of commission for several months. We run variable volume at HANA, and are moving the products we ran there to other subcontractors. Our subcontractor, Stars, also located in Ayutthaya, is underwater and out of commission. We built some of our wireless modules at Stars, and have already shifted production to an alternative subcontractor.  Our subcontractor Vigilant, located near an area of Bangkok that is at-risk of flooding, has shut down as a precautionary measure, until the risk has subsided. We have alternative sources for the packages built at Vigilant, and do not expect any impact. And finally, our subcontractor, UTAC, has 3 factories in the Bangkok area, all of which are continuing to operate.  The contingency plans developed over the years to prepare for a flood emergency have been put to very good use. The fact that we're continuing to operate as normally as one can under the circumstances, is by no accident. It is a testament to the preparation, thoughtfulness and hard work of our team in Thailand. With that, let me pass it to Steve for some general comments as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the September 2011 quarter, and then provide guidance for the December 2011 quarter.  Our September quarter results were consistent with what others in the industry have reported. We began the quarter with the understanding that there was a broad-based demand weakness, and our guidance was consistent with that. But we also expected the late summer orders for normal Christmas-related builds in September. Our distributors have largely reported that he did not see any sales related to Christmas builds materialize in September. We now believe that with a very weak macroeconomic conditions, any Christmas builds could not be deciphered. Therefore, we reported in the quarter below our original guidance. The only market where our business was slightly up was automotive, and that was driven by recovery from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. This recovery in Japan was a part of our modeling, and therefore, it did not result into any upside. The business continues to see a broad-based weakness in all markets in all geographies. The challenge always is to put Microchip's results into context. We have explained to the investors and analysts multiple times that we see the effect of industry events first. Microchip tends to see changes in business conditions earlier than most of our peers, due to a number of factors. The first is, we recognize distribution revenue on the sell-through basis worldwide, the second is we run very short lead times, which gives customers more time to make budget decisions based in more current business conditions, and the third is that we have a large number of small and medium-sized customers who tend to be quicker in adjusting their inventories. However, as there are always new investors and analysts in the mix, it is prudent to explain these factors again. When we preannounced our results on October 13, we've heard a few of the analysts emphasizing the gap between Microchip's results and the forecast of other industry peers and competitors. However, these peers and competitors missed their forecast broadly, and then guided down deeper for the December quarter. Since then, we have seen the sentiment reflect with the earnings season which results in weak guidance coming from nearly every semiconductor company, the ones who had better June and September quarters are the ones who have guided down the deepest for the December quarter. This further confirms our thesis that companies experience the effect of industry events differently, based on their revenue recognition practices as well as the customer base and vertical markets.  We continue to believe that companies will recognize their revenue to distribution on a selling basis will see further weakness as the distributors continue to adjust their inventories to reflect the macro conditions. When you start to compare December 2011 to December 2010, Microchip's results look very comparable to the industry's results, if you adjust for the acquisitions made by other companies. I believe that by the time you compare March 2012 to March 2011, you will begin to appreciate our results even further. I will now provide guidance for the December 2011 quarter, and comment on our outlook beyond the December quarter.  Our guidance is based on continuing demand weakness in the December quarter. We expect the shipment rate in December to be below the actual consumption rate by the customers. We expect this inventory burn-off to largely be over by the end of the calendar year. Therefore, we expect the December quarter to mark a bottom for Microchip for revenue, gross margin and earnings per share during this industry cycle. And we expect the March 2012 quarter to be sequentially up in revenue, gross margins and earnings per share.  I expect there may be similar skepticism of our guidance on the way up, as there was on the way down. I could have given you our calendar year '12 plan, but if history serves as a guide, that will likely fall on deaf ears. Recall that when we provided guidance of calendar '10 in November of 2009, it was also widely discounted at that time. We proceeded to beat our numbers for 2010 by a substantial margin. For us, it is more important to set the tone for running the company based on our 2012 outlook, than to convince you of our December quarter marking the bottom. So let me first provide December 2011 guidance, and then I will go through what we're doing to set up for 2012. We expect our net sales in December 2011 quarter to be flat to down 7% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be between 56.5% to 57%. We expect non-GAAP operating expense to be about 26% to 26.5% of sales, and we expect our non-GAAP operating profit to be between 30% to 31% of sales, and we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.40 to $0.44 per share.  Now let me go through what we are doing to manage through this bottoming-out quarter. In our 2 fabs, we are taking some shut down days on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's. During strong economic times, we continue to run the factories during these holidays, but it does not make sense to pay over time to run on holidays at the current time. We have also substantially cut back on the orders to our foundries for those products that are sourced there. With these actions, we expect our inventory to be about flat to slightly up in the December quarter. The inventory would begin to come down starting the March quarter, which we expect to be sequentially up in revenue. While this inventory is slightly on the high side, we believe that short lead times is one of our competitive strengths, and the inventory positions us very well for the upturn. Our products have very long life cycles, and we have a history and track record of managing inventory without onetime write-offs and selling them over the business cycles. One of the immediate benefits of this higher inventory has been a substantial reduction in capital expenditures.  Our CapEx forecast for fiscal year '12 has come down further, and is now only $70 million, and we believe that fiscal year '13 CapEx will be low too. As the holiday shutdowns are diversed in March 2012 quarter, we will expect to see gradual recovery in gross margin. With the low amount of new capital, continuing to shut off all the depreciation, the gradual ramp in our factories as inventories are burned off, and ongoing daishin and other cost reductions, we will slowly start to work the gross margin back up towards the corporate target of about 61% on a non-GAAP basis. Regarding operating expenses, we have a variable compensation structure, and we will be able to manage our operating expenses by simply adjusting the variable compensation and not doing any layoffs, except eliminating some contractors. With this approach, we will continue to focus in our key strategic initiatives, which will enable us to gain market share on the upturn and beyond. Given all the complications of accounting for the SSD acquisition completed last year, including amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges, sale of non-core businesses, gain or loss on public securities, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results will provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to First Call.  Finally, the September quarter was our 84th consecutive profitable quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 58.2%, and non-GAAP operating profit of 32.3% are the type of results that are not achieved by most of our competitors, even in the best of times. We feel very positive and confident about the long-term prospects in our business, and are continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives to drive growth. With that, Operator, would you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: As you look at the rebound, I guess, that you're seeing if you compare it to 2009, what you saw it I believe you're at double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter in 2009, how do you think this type of growth would come back?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the late 2008, 2009 drop was much steeper. The average semiconductor company was down, I think, 38% to 40% at that time. Microchip excelled for over 2 quarters back then, the quarter of December 2008 and March 2009 was down 35%, roughly. So the drop this time is not as steep as it was that time. So I wouldn't really expect the recovery to be as steep as it really was back then, but we're not prepared to give guidance past this quarter yet, other than saying that we're seeing all of the signs of the bottoming out quarter and March quarter will be up.
Operator: We'll go next to James Schandeider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: With respect to the confidence in December being the bottom, do you yet have bookings that support better take rates from distributors and your OEM customers for the month of December yet? Or said another way, would you need to see cancellations at this point for you to be in the bottom half of your guidance range for the quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I'll probably put it in a different way. The bookings have bounced up from the bottom, so the rate at which we're booking a daily basis is now higher than the worst part of the cycle. So that's really one. The customers who were not taking much product earlier have depleted their inventory, then are starting to take the product, and a number of other customers who are saying that they will deplete their inventory and will buy the full load of product the next quarter. So there are lots of anecdotal signs that really say that this quarter bottoms out.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Fair enough. And then just as a follow-up, can you may be talk about the linearity you saw through the September quarter, and what you see in terms of order rates in October?
Steve Sanghi: You have a comment on linearity in September quarter?
J. Eric Bjornholt: Well, I mean, as we indicated, we did not see the Christmas builds materialize as we anticipated entering in the quarter. And so September was weaker than what a normal September would be for us. And Steve mentioned the bookings rates have improved at this point, in time from the bottom that we saw several weeks ago.
Operator: We'll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Steve, back in June when you guys were the first to kind of signal things softening. You made a comment that suggested that the economy might already be in kind of a double-dip recession. I guess given your view the December's the hard bottom, implicit in that, is that the bottoming of the macroeconomy or do you think the gap between a sort of your shipment level and consumption is such that we don't really have to make a bet on end consumption, we just need to see some shipment levels getting back to true consumption levels?
Steve Sanghi: Well, back in June, I was looking at very significant issues in U.S., very significant issues in Europe, and China was starting to put the brakes and starting to increase their interest rates. And my assessment at that time was the U.S. economy is likely in recession already, and government will just announce it 9 months later that it was in recession like they did that in 2009. Infinitely, the U.S. economy has managed to soft land, and I think the worse GDP growth was about a quarter or so ago. And the numbers we have seen for third quarter were better and fourth quarter seem to be okay. So the economy has, despite all odds, managed to soft land. China has not totally fallen off. It's -- the business is weak, they are slowing down their economy, but their inventories are getting flushed out and the resulting level would be weaker than before, but it's still quite healthy. And Europe is probably still a tossup. We were down in Europe last quarter. We are-- this quarter, we're expecting Europe to be the worst, compared to U.S. and Asia. So Europe is still a tossup which we all -- the European issues go.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then quickly, Ganesh, on the analog performance in the September quarter, significantly better than the overall business. You talked about your ability to drive up attach rate of your analog onto your MCUs. Was that the big driver of the outperformance? And I guess relative to that trend, how much more do we have to go? How much more can you drive attach rates of analogs to your MCUs?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's been an ongoing process for several years. A lot of the investments that we made in our field teams to be able to take more control of our own destiny for demand creation has obviously rubbed off on the analog products as well. So when we go after an opportunity, with our microcontroller, obviously we're fully focused on the analog and anything else that surrounds that microcontroller. But there are cases where it's not our microcontroller or it may not be a microcontroller at all. We still want the analog and have a foot in the door at that opportunity. And that's what you're seeing from analog as it spreads, the base of applications we're in and to customers above and beyond just our microcontrollers.
Operator: We'll go next to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So you talked about trying to keep inventory flat. Does that mean utilization rates will remain flat into next quarter? If you can just give us a sense of where utilization rates are expected to go and how inventories are expected to trend beyond next quarter.
Steve Sanghi: The utilization rates will improve next quarter because the holidays we have this quarter do not repeat into the next quarter. So the utilization will have a higher number of working days. So overall, utilization would be higher, and therefore, there will be a positive impact on the gross margin. But we’re also forecasting growth in the next quarter, so. With that, the inventory would still be flat or down.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And then Steve, assuming that we get back to normal, revenue is up next quarter. What do you expect OpEx to do in that environment? Will it go up but less than sales? Or are you going to try and keep it flat?
Steve Sanghi: My sense is that you'll start to see a small operating expense leverage. Our long-term model is 25% to 26%. For the current quarter, we have guided 26% to 26.5%. So we're slightly higher than the upper end of the model. So we'll work that back towards inside the model.
Operator: We'll go next to Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Steve, let me just ask you about a few end markets. I know that given the way these products are sold through distribution end markets, commentary tends to be fairly anecdotal. But there are a couple of end markets I wanted to ask you about, one is domestic appliances and the other is industrial. To what extent -- as we've seen industrial companies put numbers out now, it looks like we're just starting to see them roll over in terms of the guidance they're providing. And so to the extent of trying to contextualize your commentary, and I know you'd like to see things ahead of other people. Do you think that's -- what is your sense of the risks within the industrial end markets relative to your comment about the outlook both for Q4 and into early next year?
Steve Sanghi: Well, there’s probably no question that the industrial markets are weak, and some other peers and competitors have given the same commentary that industrial markets are weak. But what we're shipping into industrial markets is significantly weaker than their own revenue down, because when the markets weaken, usually there's an inventory that has to be flushed out. So what we are shipping into industrial markets today is significantly below the rate at which industrial markets are consuming. And we believe that, that inventory flushes out, and therefore, even at a weak situation, we're not expecting the March quarter revenue to completely recover, where we make another all-time record quarter. But recovery will begin, and we are confident that in the industrial markets next quarter, we're likely to ship more product that we're shipping this quarter.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And also, specifically within the 16-bits. I note the customers there, Ganesh mentioned, going to an inventory correction. Do you believe -- I mean, because this has been one of the fastest growing subsegment, if one were to look beyond the inventory correction, do you still believe the trajectory of growth for 16-bits? And I -- you should have described in the past of how the growth has been progressing, should we still feel confident that, that growth can continue? Or is this the beginning of the inflection of the growth we've seen in -- on the 16-bit category?
Ganesh Moorthy: We're absolutely confident that the trajectory of growth on 16-bit is sustainable, beyond  [Audio Gap] time, the fiscal year is over. Fiscal year '12 will be higher than fiscal year '11. And as we continue into fiscal year -- the breadth of new designs that are continuing to take place is tremendous, and all those designs some may take a little longer to get to production, but they're all going to get to production. And I think you will see this sustained for many, many years to come on 16-bit.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And just remind me, Ganesh, the time line between development tools and when the customer starts actually putting it in production. I realize it varies depending on what customer but I'm assuming these development tools momentum is going to translate to real significant design activity at some point. Is there like a rule of thumb between the sale of development tools and when we'll expect to see that translate to product design and revenues that we should be aware of? Just for us to know how to kind of...
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes, the design cycle varies anywhere from 12 months to as much 30 months, depending on the product complexity, the application and the requirements to get that application into production. Obviously, our 8-bit products go to market fastest, our 16-bits are in between and our 32-bit take a longer period of time. There's not a clean way for you to approximate how a single development tool results in a specific growth. Development tools get used multiple times on many projects and for many years sometimes. So a single development tool results in many, many, many designs that go to production from it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Peter Thompson with Coho Partners.
Peter Adamson Thompson - Coho Partners, Ltd.: Steve, I was just curious if you could maybe explain the cash philosophy of the company and the logic of holding so much cash and still generating cash.
Steve Sanghi: Well, we basically -- the industry sees this 3 different uses of cash: one is in acquisitions; others in dividend; and third is using in operation; and fourth is, let's say, buying back your stock. We're not proponents of buying back our stock. We have seen lots of companies in the last decade buy huge amounts of their stock and their stocks are fractions of what they bought the stock at. Companies often tend to be very poor in figuring out the value of their own stock and the liberty they should buy at. So our philosophy and the board's philosophy always has been rather than buying our own stock, we give it back to the investors. And then have investors make a bet if they want to buy more Microchip stock. They could do that with that money. If they want to go buy somebody else, they can do that with that money. So between giving dividend and buying back stock, our preference is to give dividend. We have bought stock in the past, but we buy our stocks really at some very extreme events, those times when we believe that the investors have thrown the baby with the bathwater, and sometime completely there's a lack of understanding on the street. A stock may be at $16 and then investors are saying sell in subsequent years, so the stock grows to $35. And we have made some successful bets at those extreme events. But in general, were not the buyers of our own stock. In terms of investing our cash in operations, we are very, very profitable. We've been profitable for 84 quarters, substantially cash flow positive. So we have hardly ever needed to take the cash from treasury and use it for operations. So that use is just not there for us. And as far as acquisitions are concerned, most of the acquisitions we have done are very small tuck-in type of acquisitions, where we may need a license to a technology or buy us more technology. We have not really done a major acquisition. Most of them have relatively been small. So they do consume some cash, but we haven't been able to put our entire cash effectively into use. So as far as dividend is concerned, we are among the highest dividend payers in the technology industry. We still grow our dividend a little bit every quarter. Maybe the only company, I'm not sure of that, but probably the only company that actually grows the dividend every quarter by $0.001 or so. So we believe in that dividend and despite all that, cash is piling up and that's the way it is. That's a good thing.
Peter Adamson Thompson - Coho Partners, Ltd.: It's a very high-class problem. I guess, the arguments you've made have only suggested to me that you do have more cash than you really do need to run the business. So as a shareholder-friendly option, would a one-time dividend be considered by the board?
Steve Sanghi: Well, when we have talked about one-time dividend over the past years, it hasn't been looked at very favorably because one-time dividends usually do not result into any long-term sustainable benefit. It does not really get into a long-term future return that investors can make. We'd rather grow the dividend so investors today and the investors tomorrow continue to get dividend benefits out of that. With most one-time dividends, investors flip out after the dividends has been received. So we believe the value is very short-lived.
Operator: We'll go next to Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associate.
Gilbert Alexandre: Could you give us an idea of what your days inventory levels you're at now?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. The days of inventory is 132.
J. Eric Bjornholt: 132 days.
Gilbert Alexandre: And could you just indicate again how much your 8-bit business was down? And how does your 8-bit business now compare with 2007?
Ganesh Moorthy: So we don't break out our revenue by 8-bit microcontroller. We provide some color on 16 and 32 in terms of growth rates but not the absolute numbers 8s, 16s and 32 are a continuum of microcontrollers that gets used by our customers. And we really don't see much benefit in providing the breakdown.
Steve Sanghi: But Gil, our 8-bit business is well above the 2007 levels. That business was a record in fiscal '11. I think, we said that back then. 2011 8-bit microcontroller business was a record, and now it just come down in the last couple of quarters. And the company has had weak performance but it’s way above the 2007 levels.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I wanted to go back to one of the comments that you made about shipping last to you customers than you thought that they were consuming. And I was wondering if you had a way of gauging by how much. And as an example, I think, right now, the guidance is somewhere about 13.5% below the run rate where you guys were at the beginning of this year in the March quarter. Do you have a sense -- and I know it's a difficult question to answer, but how much of that would be attributed to the inventory effect and how much of that would be actual end demand has been reduced since that time?
Steve Sanghi: So one last quirk. Don't add the sequentially down for 3 quarters. I made the same mistake and Gordon corrected me. When the numbers are going up, the cumulative is higher than the sum of those. When the numbers are going down, the cumulative is lower than sum of all those 3. That's just a math quirk. So the overall it's not down 13.5%, it's less than that. What your other part of the question was?
Ganesh Moorthy: Can we decode the end market consumption difference? And I think it's very hard to decipher.
Steve Sanghi: So we're talking of too many customers. We just have -- we serve 70,000 customers, and a couple of thousand customers we serve directly in the balance through distribution. So there are customers where we know, where we are shipping 0. We shipped 0 in October and probably we'll ship 0 in November. And may ship a little bit. And there are other customers who may be down just slightly to their run rate. It's all over the place, and there's just no way to average it across so many customers, so many markets, so many industries. But there are customers where we're seeing they're saying, "I'm not likely to take much product this quarter, but I'll completely use it up and then take the more product next quarter."
J. Eric Bjornholt: One other thing we can do is we can also see the public results of the many of our customers and how their overall results are progressing quarter-to-quarter. And I think in that, we can build some insight as well.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And after looking at that, do you get confidence that you are indeed shipping below what they're consuming at this point?
Steve Sanghi: That we know for sure, because you can't know that out of 70,000 customers, but several large customers, based on what their run rate is, and when we're asking them why haven't they taken product this month and they're saying, "I still have 1.5 months more of inventory," or something.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. Maybe I'll try an easier one for my follow-up. In the past, as you guys have grew out of downturns, we've looked at incremental gross margins around the 70% or so range. Would that still be your expectation coming out of this downturn?
Steve Sanghi: We haven't modeled that revenue. We haven't modeled that, so I'll just rather not confirm or deny without actually doing the math on that.
Operator: We'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan.
Harsh N. Kumar - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division: December quarter, Steve, you're basically calling the bottom. Is it going to be a macro thing? Or do you see some markets performing better, end markets performing better than others? If so could you maybe highlight them if possible?
Steve Sanghi: I don't know if I can distinguish them, but it's almost certain that all markets and all customers within that market won't behave the same. So it will be a staggered thing that corrects over a period of time.
Harsh N. Kumar - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then I wanted some clarification from Ganesh or your staff on shutdowns. Are you talking about shutdowns that are on top of normal shutdowns for your factories? From what I remember, Steve, you have a strategy of running the factory through downturn for utilization purposes and particularly curious since you see the light at the end of the tunnel in 2 months.
Steve Sanghi: So the shutdowns we are talking about is basically the holiday days. So usually, we run our factories on 24th and 25th of December. We run them on 31st and 1st of January. The ones, which are usually company holidays, we run our factories because factories have such a fixed cost structure. So we always run our factories, and we decided not to run the factory on those particular holidays. We are taking a few days maintenance-related shutdown that we have to take in our order fab every year. That is kind of normal. We've added a day or so to it but that part is normal. The other newer factory that we have in Agrasha Modigan [ph], we don't take a maintenance-related shutdown every year. We take it once in 3, 4, 5 years. But the older factory, we take a shutdown every year between Christmas and New Year.
Operator: We'll go next to Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.
Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Two quick questions. Your orders -- you've noticed that your orders have bottomed, and you've seen some improvement in the last several weeks, kind of unrelated to the previous caller there. What has been the-- where do you think the rebound is coming from? And kind of unrelated question, if some of us actually listened to what have to say and believe your opinion on the industry, what do you think will come out fastest next year? I don't know when it's going to happen, but where do you think it's going to lead the rebound in terms of segments?
Steve Sanghi: Well, where we are seeing the bookings come from, I believe it's largely broad-based. We haven't seen it flavor up a given the geography. I think we don't really track our bookings by sector, and we have really no way to do that because majority of the bookings actually come through distribution, where the customers place the bookings on them. So from a geographic standpoint, I've really seen bookings bottom out in every region and recovering from there. What will lead the recovery into next year, I think it's a broad-based downturn, it will be broad-based recovery. If U.S. economy avoids recession, which I think it kind of largely has, then you'll see a little bit of recovery everywhere. And when Europe -- Europe is quite strong in certain countries, Germany and France and others are very strong, but some other countries are weak, so Europe is a very mixed bag.
Operator: We'll go next to Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: This one relates to channel inventory. Do you see a need for distributors to actually begin increasing their levels of channel inventory? And then at what point in the recovery process might you expect that to occur?
Steve Sanghi: We do not see that distributors to increase their level of channel inventory because the channel inventory is actually high right now. And part of the inventory correction is happening at distributors. Distributors are giving lower amount of new orders than they're shipping out, so that distributor inventory is dropping. And it needs to drop, and we believe most of that process will be concluded also this quarter. So the next quarter will be more in balance. Now as the distributors change their inventory, it doesn't have a effect on Microchip because we don't take shipments into distributor as revenue. But this was part of my comment in my prepared remarks that those competitors and peers who take the sell-in as a revenue recognition are going to see substantial drops, and you have seen in many other guidance, which are the mid-double digits. And they could see a further drop in Q1 as distributors continue to correct further inventory. At Microchip, it doesn't have effect on our revenue.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, terrific. Very helpful. And then the follow-up question that I have is a little bit of a higher level question pertaining to the microcontroller business. The question is, with regards to the newer businesses, the 16- and 32-bit businesses, as those businesses grow at a rate faster than the 8-bit business and become a more critical mass of the overall mix of the microcontroller business, how does that affect your go-to-market approach, your interaction with customers? And also, how does that affect the pricing as it relates to the 8-bit controllers based on how you're growing the 16-; and 32-bit business?
Steve Sanghi: Well, Ganesh may add something to it, but let me say a few words. The biggest change that I have seen in the last several years as the component of our 16- and 32-bit businesses has grown, and prior to that, may be we were largely 8-bit, is that the business has become more application-specific. The 8-bit business was much more horizontal, where there are generally trained application engineers and salespeople who can sell all of these 8-bit products. And now, we need specialists on motor control, digital power supply, Touch Sense, LED lighting, medical, connectivity to iPhone, iPad kind of devices, automotive and on and on and on. Because as the device gets larger and larger, the more complex devices, the applications become more specific and customers need more help. So I think that really has been the change. And in the last several years, we had to accommodate putting all of that specialist's structure and field application engineering specialist structure into place to successfully sell these products, which we are and even in adversity, 32-bit is growing. It grew last quarter. It grew quarter before. And that's really one of the changes we have seen. And as a result, it has had some impact on our operating expenses, which we -- seeing long-term model is 25% to 26%, which could have been 0.5% or 1% higher than maybe something we said 5, 6 years ago. Do you want to add some details?
Ganesh Moorthy: My only addition would be I think it's also because of the what's -- the more complex applications, as Steve described, it's much more than just a hardware sale. It's how the software, the application support, the reference designs, the total solution sell comes together. And I don't think it's only on 16s and 32-bits, I think even on many of our 8-bit products. We have products with much more capability today than we did many years ago, and that total solution sell, including hardware and software coming together, is an important part of how we go to market.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then Ganesh, as a follow-up to that comment, is there a certain crossover point where the 16- and 32-bit businesses get barging off where they have somewhat of a parasitic effect on your ability to sell the 8-bit versus upsell your customer to a 16 and 32? I was wondering if there is some sort of an effect on the core 8-bit business in pricing?
Ganesh Moorthy: No. And 8s, 16s and 32s coexist, have coexisted, will coexist. I think they all solve different needs. And there is no way that a single solution meets all the different market needs that are out there. It's a very fragmented market. There are many, many solutions that are needed. Even as we have grown our 16- and 32-bit business, our 8-bit is going to be -- continue to grow as well, maybe not at the same rate, but coming off of a larger base. And so I think people from the early '90s have been talking about 8-bit business being cannibalized by 16-bit or 32-bit, and it's alive strong and kicking.
Steve Sanghi: The phenomena that you're describing is more given by people who only makes 16 or make only 32. The person who makes only 32, what is he supposed to do? Sell 32 into every application, in every design they win. Sometime they win from 32, sometime they win from 16, and they look at that as a cannibalization. We make all of them, and we continue to make substantial investments in 8-bit, with new products and cost reductions and all that. So our difference in our cost and ASP structure between 8, 16 and 32 is really maintaining. And a customer simply going from 8 to 16 for no other reason is going to pay a higher price, which he doesn't need to pay because our 8-bit is cheaper, always will be.
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel Nicolaus. :p id="109309719" name="Kevin Cassidy" /> I just have one more follow-up.On the licensing growth that you saw, was that new customers? Or is it existing customers that were expanding their relationships or higher volume?
Steve Sanghi: So it's a combination of it. Every quarter, we sign new licenses and every quarter we have existing licenses. Some have the license payments because a certain milestone was met. In certain cases, they're in production and they're in higher volumes. So we get more royalty. But the fundamental tenet in that business is the percentage share of the overall microcontroller, DSPs, Smart Card and other markets, which use the nonvolatile flash memory. The percentage penetration of our technology SuperFlash is going up quarter after quarter after quarter. More and more IDMs are adopting it, more and more foundries are adopting it. It is the preeminent technology. Everyone of our competitors, I can't say all because that's always not correct, but a majority of our competitors, even licensees of our technology, they're using it inside their own fab. They're using it at the foundries. So even in a down business, which we have had for the last couple of quarters, the licensing business has done record every quarter because it has that much market share gain going on.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Great. And do you have a long-term model of what you expect as a percentage of revenue? Or is it just expect to take -- continue to take market share?
Steve Sanghi: We definitely have it in-house, but not for public consumption.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Steve Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Well, thanks to everybody. There are a couple of conferences coming up that we will go this quarter. And we'll see many of you on the conference circuit this quarter. And otherwise, we'll see you next quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: And again, that does conclude today's call. We do appreciate everyone's participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead.
J. Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip’s COO; and Gordon Parnell, Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. I will comment on our first quarter of fiscal year 2012 financial performance and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com. We believe you will find this useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results. I will be referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses. Net sales in the June quarter were $374.5 million and were down sequentially 1.4% from net sales of $380 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and were up 4.9% from net sales of $357.1 million in the June 2010 quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 59.5% in the June quarter and non-GAAP operating expenses were 25% of sales, both in line with our preliminary results that we shared with the Street on July 11. Operating income was 34.5% of sales and net income was $111.4 million or $0.55 per diluted share. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related intangible amortization, were 58.7% in the June quarter. Total operating expenses were $102.9 million or 27.5% of sales and includes share-based compensation of $7.6 million and acquisition-related expenses of $1.6 million. GAAP net income was $99.3 million or $0.49 per diluted share.  In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 12.9% and the GAAP tax rate was 12.8%. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax-advantaged securities. We expect our combined forward-looking effective tax rate on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis to be about 12.75% to 13.25%. To summarize the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share on the June quarter, share-based compensation was about $0.038, acquisition-related items were about $0.015 and noncash interest expense was about $0.006. The dividend declared today at $0.347 per share will be paid on September 1, 2011, to shareholders of record on August 18, 2011. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $66.3 million.  Moving on to the balance sheet. Microchip's inventory at June 30, 2011, was $202.5 million or 119 days, up 12 days from the prior-quarter levels. Inventory at our distributors was 43 days, which is up 3 days from the prior-quarter level. We see an increasing trend of the large OEM customers using distribution to hold bonded inventory on their behalf in order to achieve 0 lead times without having to carry inventory on their balance sheets. This has resulted in a general increase over time in the amount of inventory our distributors carry. However, I'll remind you that our global distribution revenue is recognized on a sell-through basis. At June 30, Microchip's accounts receivable balance was $196.3 million, an increase of 8.8% from the balance as of the end of March. The increase in receivables was driven by the shipment linearity in the quarter. Receivable balances are in great condition with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers.  As of June 30, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1.72 billion, and was up $9 million from the prior-quarter level. In the June quarter, Microchip had a $16 million tax payment that will not repeat in the September quarter and we also made our semiannual payment of interest on our junior subordinated convertible debentures of $12.2 million. Additionally, our accounts receivable and inventory positions grew during the June quarter, impacting our overall cash generation. Our total cash and investment position is projected to grow by approximately $90 million to $100 million in the September quarter, prior to our dividend payment. Capital spending was approximately $27.2 million for the June quarter and depreciation expense in the June quarter was $22 million, which was down from depreciation of $22.8 million in the March quarter. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was down 2% on a sequential basis, but was up 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.  Our 8-bit microcontroller business delivered a solid performance, but did not escape the impact of the broad-based slowdown we experienced. Despite this, our 8-bit business was up from the year-ago quarter. Our 16-bit microcontroller business was down 3.1% sequentially, but was up 43% from the year-ago quarter. We continued to see many new customers, as well as additional designs at existing customers going to production. Our 32-bit microcontroller business had another strong quarter of growth in the June quarter and was up 18.7% on a sequential basis and up 108.5% from the year-ago quarter to achieve a new record. 12 quarters after we started shipping 32-bit microcontrollers, the revenue growth and momentum continues to compare favorably versus our 16-bit microcontrollers at the same point in time. The number of customers in volume production grew sequentially from 584 to 657 as we continue to build a broad base of customers to grow this business. We expect the 32-bit business to grow in the September quarter and achieve another record. Moving to development tools. We shipped approximately 44,000 development tools in the June quarter, roughly flat with what we shipped in the March quarter. Development tools sales remain an excellent leading indicator of continued strong design and activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers. Development tools get used by our customers on multiple projects over several years and as such, the continued trend of strong development tools sales bodes well for future growth. Finally, sometime later this month, Microchip will ship out 10-billion cumulative microcontrollers. It exemplifies the trust placed in us by over 70,000 customers worldwide as we endeavor to enable their innovation. This will be another historic milestone in our journey to be the very best embedded control solutions company ever and mark the collective contributions by our worldwide teams over many, many years. Now let's move to our analog products. Our analog business was down 7% sequentially,, but was up 2.4% from the year-ago quarter. We remain pleased with the design and momentum our analog business has shown, and we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new products, which we expect will contribute to strong revenue growth in the future. Now moving to our memory products. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory, products was up 0.6% on a sequential basis. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions.  Let me now pass this to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the June 2011 quarter and then provide guidance for the September 2011 quarter. The majority of my comments on the June quarter were made during the pre-announcement conference call on July 11. We essentially saw a broad-based demand and bookings weakness across multiple market segments and multiple customers in each segment. In the conference call on July 11, I said, "We believe that our June quarter results reflect weak overall market conditions, which we believe will impact the broad-based semiconductor industry in the June or September quarter, depending on the individual market exposures and revenue recognition practices of the company." Since then, we have seen this sentiment reflect to the earnings season with a weak guidance coming from Linear, Freescale, Texas Instruments, Silicon Labs, STMicroelectronics, Intersil, Micrel, NXP Semiconductors, IDT, Power Integration and others. The semiconductor supply chain is confirming the same sentiment with weak guidance from TSMC and UMC on the wafer foundry side, Teradyne from the test equipment side, [indiscernible] in applied materials from the fab equipment side and Arrow Electronics from the compliment [ph] distribution. There could be some companies that are exceptions due to a particular product transition or momentum in a given application segment, but we continue to believe that most companies will see the weakness manifest itself as the quarter progresses and their guidance is likely to be too aggressive. The broad-based global weakness seen [ph] has also been reflected by large multinational industrial conglomerates like Emerson Electric Co. Last week's Durable Goods report also cited that new orders for durable goods fell unexpectedly in June and a weak June quarter GDP report and a very weak ISM Index this week caps it all. Our long-term investors and analysts have seen Microchip experience these industry events first. Microchip tends to see changes in business conditions earlier than most of our peers due to a number of factors. Number one, we recognize distribution revenue on a sell-through basis worldwide. Number two, we run very short lead times, which gives customers more time to make purchase decisions based on more current business conditions. And number three, we have a large number of small- and medium-sized customers who tend to be quicker in adjusting their inventories. I will now provide guidance for the September 2011 quarter. Nothing that we have seen in the month of July changes our view that we represented in our pre-announcement conference call. Our view has now been confirmed by a large number of industry players, many of whom have fairly broad-based businesses. The overall market environment continues to be weak.  Therefore, we're maintaining the guidance that we provided on July 11. We expect our net sales to be down from low to mid-single digit percentage. We expect the non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be between 59.3% and 59.7% of sales with the midpoint being even with the June quarter. We expect the non-GAAP operating expense to be about 25% to 25.5% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP operating profit to be between 33.8% to 34.7% of sales. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.50 to $0.54 per share. We expect our inventory in the September quarter to be in the range of 130 days. While this inventory is higher than what we experienced in our recent past, we believe that short lead times is one of our competitive strengths. We, therefore, believe that the inventory is acceptable and we will bring it down over time without any harsh actions in manufacturing. Our products have very long lifetimes, and we have a history and track record of managing inventory without onetime write-offs in selling them over the business cycles. One of the immediate benefits of the higher inventory is a substantial reduction in our capital expenditures. We again reaffirmed that we have lowered our CapEx forecast from $125 million that used to be, to $75 million for fiscal year '12.  Given all the complications of accounting for the SST acquisition, which we completed last year, including amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges and sales of non-core businesses, like many other companies have done, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results will provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters. And we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.  Finally, while our overall results for the June quarter are disappointing, we did manage to make it our 83rd consecutively profitable quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 59.5% and a non-GAAP operating profit of 34.5% are the type of results that are not achieved by most of our competitors even in the best of times. We feel very positive about the long-term prospects in our business. And we are continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives to drive growth.  With that, operator, would you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Question for Steve. When you think about the weakness that you're seeing right now, can you give us a sense of how much you think it is real like end-customer weakness out there versus your distributor customers concerned about the macro environment and taking inventory levels below normal, what would be normal levels?
Steve Sanghi: If distributors were simply taking inventory at below normal level, that will have no impact on our revenue because we recognize revenue 100% on sell-through worldwide. That would impact the revenue of other companies who have a selling revenue recognition, but it wouldn't affect our revenue because of sell-through.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Understand, Steve. I guess what I really meant was your distributors customers. So the OEMs or the contract manufacturers getting more nervous about what they're seeing in the macro environment and whether or not you have a view on if you think they're taking their inventory levels below normal levels.
Steve Sanghi: That's basically demand weakness. It's very hard to really make the differential. A large number of customers have logistics program with their distributors where the inventories are actually held by the distributors and they draw the inventory as they need the product. That's more and more trend going in that direction, which is also one of the reasons that, I think, distribution inventory grows over time and the end-customer inventory actually comes down. I think it's all weak demand. There's lack of confidence in the economy, lack of confidence in consumers, lack of confidence in businesses, people aren't building products.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Fair enough. And then question for Eric. I think you've mentioned the account receivable DSOs trending up. Is that a positive signal for the linearity during the quarter? If you could give some color on that, I appreciate it.
J. Bjornholt: Okay. So, I mean, really that's just a function of when product was scheduled to ship to our distributors. So I don't think you can make too much out of that as a positive sign. We think that accounts receivable balance will come down in the current quarter. Receivables remain in good shape.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Christopher Danely with JP Morgan.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co: My first question is for Steve. So Steve, you've been through quite a few of these cycles. I mean how do you compare this versus what happened in '08? Do you think we're -- do the customers act as scared as they did back then? Do you think it's just a garden variety demand correction? I'd just appreciate your views on what you think is happening out there.
Steve Sanghi: Well, the 2008 cycle was more episodic. It was very fast contraction of the economy and the credit globally just very, very quick contraction that took the semiconductor industry down almost, I think, 36% to 40% over 6 months. Clearly, nobody's expecting that sort. But I think a double-dip recession either already started or is right around the corner. You made a call in 2008, 2009. The government didn't confirm the recession until 9 months after it already finished. So -- however they've measured these numbers, it's clearly visible in the economy, in the stock market. After a wonderful day today in the stock market, I think market is already discounting a recession. And I believe we may already be in one.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Got it. And then as my follow-up on what sort of a signs are you looking for, besides the obvious customer orders that were bottoming? And what would it take for you guys to get a little more aggressive on the buy back?
Steve Sanghi: Buyback. We don't really buy back stock that often except under some unique circumstances in the past. We're largely trying to give investors a return through dividend program and long-term stock price growth. So I'm not really looking at any buyback short term. We also have been acquiring a number of small and one large company last year, so we need cash for that, too. But in terms of your first question, what kind of signs we'll be looking. So we have ability internally to pick any large customer in any market. We have so many customers, which is very hard for us to say X percent of business is industrial and Y percent of our business is consumer, and we don't do that. But we can take a basket of X number of customers in any given market and look at the buying pattern quarter-over-quarter over a given design. And as that run rate of a given product starts going up in consumption -- on a consumption basis, that will be my sign that the economy is returning, and I'll tell you so.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Steve, just to follow on the previous questions. It sounds like from your commentary, you think that over the next couple of quarters, all of the things being equal from you're seeing from customers today, that orders are going to continue to decelerate from here even further. Is that a fair assessment?
Steve Sanghi: The order deflation has more to do with the lead times contracting rapidly because the inventories are healthy, as you saw ours and many of our competitors. So when the inventories are healthy and business is down by a small single-digit percentage, but the orders are down much more and so most of the orders down are the reflect of shrinking lead times so people don't have to place orders out in time.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Understand. And then since the last call, with respect to the automotive market, which is one area of weakness you specifically called out, have you had any more time to kind of assess what you think is going on with the automotive supply chain? Is that geographic specific? Is it customers just taking down inventories? Or is it just automotive makers not producing finished units at all?
Steve Sanghi: Well, basically, what happened the last quarter in automotive is pretty clear now. The hindsight is always 20/20. The automotive customers put it in some orders in the March quarter after the earthquake, which happened on March 11. So in fact, we have beaten our March quarter and when you look back at the automotive shipments to a given customer, they actually have pulled some orders in. So last quarter, there was a little bit of correction of that inventory because they had pulled the orders in. Secondly, every single automotive suppliers built less cars. Substantial contraction in Japan at companies like Toyota and Honda and others, but there was similar impact on U.S. and European automotive, which had either Japanese engine controllers or other parts. So the entire supply chain was disrupted, and the actual number of cars built data is available. We have it and you should have access to it from various places. One place I can send you is look at Gentex publicly announced earnings reports. It's a public company listed on NASDAQ called the GNTX. They make the mirrors, which have -- the chromatic mirror, which dims when the light comes from the back and it also has 3 buttons by which you can program your garage door. So that company has listed a table that shows what were the prior forecasts, what are the current forecasts for the number of cars built. So that's one place I can send you, but there are many other automotive reports available. So clearly, less cars got built last quarter. And in the remaining year, they're all a expecting recovery of that as the Japanese supply chain is becoming healthier. Will it be completely healthy by the end of this quarter? I don't know. We're already starting to see more bookings and some recovery in the automotive business. But with 2 months to go, it is not totally clear whether it will be completely done by the end of this quarter, so I expect it to actually linger into the following quarter whereby the end of the year, likely same number of cars will get built. That's what the forecast shows, which means what we lost earlier, we should see significant recovery in our automotive business. So there's a chance, and I'm not forecasting right now, but there's a chance that third quarter -- our fiscal third quarter, December quarter, is unseasonal. Usually, that quarter's a weak quarter but that could be unseasonal this time.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: You've reduced your CapEx at $75 million. If this lingers on longer, can you reduce that further or is this maintenance level?
Steve Sanghi: So it is not maintenance level, but we spent a fair amount in fiscal quarter 1, the June quarter, and we're also spending a fair amount in the September quarter, largely driven by noncancellable orders were in place and the equipment is coming in as we speak, and we couldn't cancel it. In some cases, we slipped at some. But then the capital is very, very low in the December and March quarter. So if the environment lingers on, yes, it could go lower but not for the fiscal year because it was forward -- the spending was upfront a little bit.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Maybe could you just remind us what the spending was on?
Steve Sanghi: All sorts. Fab equipment, test equipment, assembly equipment, R&D. Just everything.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: I just wonder if you could address just some of the comments you made on production levels, and it sounds like you're not making any drastic changes on production, which I guess is keeping that -- helping the gross margins to hold in. What sort of outlook needs to hold with respect to demand for you guys to be able to maintain those levels and not build some more inventory here?
Steve Sanghi: Well, you have to go back in our history where we have managed through lots of different industry cycles. And our strategy -- with the exception of sort of what happened in 2008 where demand went down 35% where you had to do something different. But normally, the inventory correction in a minor demand weakness of low single digits, sort of mid-single-digits we're seeing right now, our strategy always has been to keep the productions stable and allow the inventory to fluctuate rather than fluctuate the production and try to keep the inventory stable. We are able to produce a product today with the equipment we have. And if we don't produce the product and let the equipment be idle, the depreciation continues. And later on, when you have to produce the product, you have to add more equipment to do so. And it's a high fixed cost business in the fabs, and we can only save about $0.20 to $1 by not making the product. So for our investors' money and for our own money, it's a good bet if you believe the inventory is good. If you make SoC products or some product that will become obsolete or in a fast-changing designs where customer goes from one product to the other, that strategy would not work. But for long life-cycled products like us, we should utilize the capacity when it's available because if I build the $10 million lower inventory, I'll have $10 million more cash on which I earned 0.01%.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay. And I guess as a follow-up to that, maybe you could remind us what sort of flexibility you have on the OpEx side in the event that this downturn persists longer than we might think.
Steve Sanghi: So on the OpEx side, as we demonstrated back in 2009, we were able to cut 24% of the OpEx out. And even without laying off anybody else, we managed it through zeroing our bonuses. We took a lot of the discretionary costs out. And in that extreme event, actually, we had the entire company on a 10% pay cut, which in the current environment we don't expect it gets that bad that we have to resort to any such measures, although bonuses would be smaller and employees already know that. So our guidance for OpEx has been in the 24% to 26% range for a long period of time. And in the height of the upturn, we opted to very near 24%, and our current guidance is 24% to 25.5%. If the things get worse, we actually have more room still to stay within our guidance. And if we start to go outside of that, then we'll have to resort to some other measures if necessary.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: But your expectation...
J. Bjornholt: I just want to clarify. For the current quarter, the guidance is between 25% and 25.5%. In the long-term model, it's between 24% to 26%.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: And what you're saying is your expectation is under a wide range of scenarios, you stay within that long-term range?
Steve Sanghi: We'd be able to stay within that band because we still have more flexibility in the expenses even where we are at.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Sumit Dhanda with Citadel Securities.
Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC: A couple of questions. Steve, could you talk about what's baked into the assumption that you have in the September quarter, either in terms of the trajectory of sales or bookings that you anticipate from now through quarter end, and if there's a book-to-bill number that you'd care to share?
Steve Sanghi: No, we stopped sharing book-to-bill ratio a couple of quarters ago. It just confuses everybody and has never correlated. In fact, if you recall, we told you that the book-to-bill ratio was pretty good going into June quarter, and it did not, again, correlate because the number turned negative. The actual results were negative while the book-to-bill ratio going into June was pretty good. So it really -- it just has no correlation. It can -- it's just really -- basically, it does not make sense. So as some earlier question was, how are the bookings? Bookings are not good, but bookings are not good predominately driven by very short lead times where all the product is available, but we're getting the turns. So people are placing short-term orders for the products they need. And we believe the product is available, and we believe that the demand should be there to get to where we need to get to.
Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC: Okay, but I guess my question was are you expecting a material tick up in bookings from current levels to get to where you need to be? Or is that not part of your expectation?
Steve Sanghi: The bookings don't need to pick up. There just need to be healthy turns component in that. The bookings don't have to pick up. The bookings result only would be the next quarter backlog will be weak. So the next quarter turns have to be good again. And usually, turns are good when the lead times are short.
Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC: I got it. The other question I had was, you guys have done such a good job of maintaining such low lead times. But when I looked at, for example, your total inventory, your channel and your internal inventory combined, it's knocking up on 6 months. Why do you feel like you need to carry that much inventory when your lead times are so short?
Steve Sanghi: Lead times are short because of the inventory. Cause and effect. Our lead times were -- when our internal inventory was 95 days, just about 6, 8 months ago and the disti inventory was probably 5, 6 days lower, we were having significant trouble. The lead times were longer.
J. Bjornholt: We have a high mix in our product line, and so inventory is never perfect for what the demand comes in at. And so some of that inventory is to help satisfy the mix, the demand mix that comes in.
Steve Sanghi: We have over 2,000 mask types and over 80,000 SKUs. It's a very, very broad mix serving 70,000 customers. Now if you shift to the large customer, a one-type product, the dynamic RAM 64-gigabit or something and one product, then yes, it's little bit lower inventory. We got lot of products and lots of SKUs.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: Steve, I guess, trying to find a silver lining. My first question, given the guidance really hasn't changed from 4 weeks ago, implicit in that is there a stabilization going on? Or is it just that the June, July month deteriorating kind of at the rate that you thought it would? And if the latter, is that an early sign of things bottoming?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the things haven't changed since July 11 because we probably appropriately predicted what the quarter might shape up to be, and we put that in our July 11 call also. Has the environment further deteriorated? You could see by most of the reports, the people who were not saying that before are saying it now. Many of the reports came out after our July 11 call, citing it to be a specific Microchip issue and the other channel checks were not showing that. And you can go back and read some of those reports, and now, everybody's saying that. So I think it has caught up to everybody, and the environment has gotten weaker, but we had put that in, in our forecast already.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: Well, I guess, Steve, my question is, is being able to predict accurately the rate of deterioration kind of an early sign that you got your hands around the situation? As we think about how this bottoms out and the bottoming process, is this an early sign of the bottoming process or not?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I mean, I'm not an economist. And my job is not always forecasting longer term or anything like that. We just basically give you a quarter guidance at a time. With over 1,000 points to drop here in Dow, 1,500 points now in the last few weeks, 2, 3 weeks. How much money has been lost and what does it do to the consumer confidence and spending and investment? And so I don't really know all those derivative effects. Do things get better? Does this economy go into a tailspin? Not quite the 2008 style, but it actually really goes into a double dip. My sense is it already is in one. But I can't tell you yet, when does it recover and how deep it gets, although I did say that I see automotive recovery on the horizon.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: And then, Steve, as my follow up. I understand and I agree with the strategy of kind of managing inventory and not throttling down utilization. But in the '08, '09 time period, you did hit a pain point where you took utilization down pretty hard and you saw gross margins for a quarter drop, I believe, below 50%. I'm just kind of curious what's the pain point this time around? And what would you need to see to kind of make the decision that, yes, dropping utilization is the right near-term strategy?
Steve Sanghi: Well, like I said, in 2008, from September 2008 to March 2009, Microchip business was down I think 35%. Industry was down a little more than that. So that's what triggered it back then. We're not talking -- we're talking single-digit drops here, so I don't really think it's going to make us change anything.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.
Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: Question for you on China. You have a decent exposure to the Chinese and you're selling to China. Just wondering what your sense is from that market in terms of in demand and order rates?
Steve Sanghi: So our China business in the June quarter was up. We don't break it out specifically out from Asia but our China business was up. Overall, Asia was down but the China business was up. Is it slowing down? Yes. Did it also miss what we had expected to do in China? Yes. But it was still positive, but we had expected it to be a lot more positive.
Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: Understood. And then you said the December quarter if the auto rebounds like your OEM customers are predicting, that you could have an unseasonal up quarter in December. Is auto a big enough part of your business in proportion to your business to be able to drive that -- your total revenues up?
Steve Sanghi: Well, that's -- we don't know. We don't know if any other sector will join that. I see auto largely driven by the supply chain disruption going away and the number of cars coming back. Now could you have another effect, if the economy weakens and confidence rate weakens and you can't get car loans and other, then the car demand weakens. So therefore, then the car manufacturers do not build all the cars that they're planning to build. That is not in the forecast. Right now, the forecast that I have seen, which I referred to you in Gentex press release says we get back to the same number of cars for 2010. So what they lost in Q2, they'll make it up in Q3 and Q4. But if the demand isn't there for that Q3 and Q4, then the number could go down. So -- but either way you put it, there should be some recovery in the automotive. Would it be strong enough to make that much difference in our overall numbers? I don't know yet.
Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: Okay, and then my last question is what was the SuperFlash, the SST revenue in the quarter?
J. Bjornholt: We don't break that out by -- I think we have a memory reporting segment which is SuperFlash and Serial E-squared combined.
Steve Sanghi: Which did what?
J. Bjornholt: It was up 0.6%.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Steve, let me just show -- I understand a little bit what's going on with the distis. Given the way things weakened, how much of the guidance reflects a de-stocking going on within the distis? I mean, I don't know how, if it is going to, perhaps quantify or describe to us a little bit more what's going on within the distis. Are they de-stocking now? Do they have a -- and from your experience, how much longer do you think that could last?
Steve Sanghi: What do you mean by de-stocking going on at distis?
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: What I mean is, so are they holding?
Steve Sanghi: Distis buying less product?
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Exactly because of the general and macro [ph] that they have right now, I mean.
Steve Sanghi: How many times do we have to explain? That does not affect our revenue. I think Street really needs to understand what is sell-in versus sell-through recognition means. We do not recognize revenue when we give the product to distributors. So if there's a de-stocking in distributors, that does not affect our revenue.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Right. It's not necessarily yours. I mean, you're talking about other companies as well in your opening remark. My question is not just so much now, whether from your conversations with them, is there something that you think the fear that the distis will have will last beyond, not just in September quarter. I mean I'm just trying to understand what, in your conversations with them, what is the psyche of the disti right now?
Steve Sanghi: Well, speaking of the distributor is that they are seeing weak demand from their customers. They are seeing similar to what we are seeing. Arrow's guidance was relatively weak. Avnet numbers haven't come out yet. So my feeling is that distis would be de-stocking. They would be buying less products. So I think the companies that have a sell-in revenue recognition, I can rattle them off, but I'd rather than not. I think you should be able to find those out, I believe will have to take that correction at the distributor inventory Microchip would not have to.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Something else, Steve, I mean, back in 2008 when we had all these housing-related issues, you gave us some numbers as to how much of the exposure was to the U.S. and particularly housing. Now I know we've talked about automotive as one subsegment. Is there anything else -- and I know housing hasn't improved. I don't know whether it's deteriorated much more from what you're seeing. But any comments you can make to us as to aid your U.S. consumer exposure, and whether housing-related products are an area where we've seen further deterioration in your business mix?
Steve Sanghi: Well, it didn't do me any good in giving you that index back a few years ago.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Well, you gave it, so I don't know if you've maintained it and if you were able to give us more insight.
Steve Sanghi: We don't have it anymore. And it didn't do any good. Nobody bought it. People thought it was just Microchip-specific problem, and so it didn't work that time. So there's no reason to repeat it.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: All right. And just one last question. In terms of your 32-bit product, I mean, that has been growing quite strongly. And are we at a point where we can -- we haven't broken out what the size of that business is, so presumably it's still very small. As you sell that product, how much of this response you're getting that's reflected is a function -- and I'm going back to the issue of ARM versus your choice of MIPS. Obviously, your succeeding in this, and I'm just trying to understand how much of this success you've had is dependent on the overall package that Microchip presents to its customers, easy design tools and all that. And how much of it is a differentiation that your choice of MIPS as a core brings to your offering to your customers? So I don't know if you understand what I'm trying to ask here, but you made the choice to use MIPS, and obviously that doesn't seem to -- relatively different from everybody, that they use ARM. I just want to understand, if you can explain to me what has brought this level of success you're seeing here on the 32-bit front?
Steve Sanghi: I'll have Ganesh try to answer that question.
Ganesh Moorthy: I don't think there's a MIPS versus ARM discussion here. We sell PIC microcontrollers that has a set of attributes that customers expect with respect to our tools, our software, our compatibility, the migration capability. The product is doing well because it meets what the customers’ expectations are and it exceeds in more cases than not. It's still growing off of a smaller base, so that's why you can see the faster growth rates. But I think the argument of MIPS versus ARM doesn't come into the equation here. People are buying PIC microcontrollers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next is Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company: Steve, in your guidance for down 1% to 6%, what is it that will distinguish between the lower end of that range and the higher end of that range in the business? Is it just overall turns activity in the quarter? Or is it more a function of what happens in individual end markets like automotive that you called out earlier?
Steve Sanghi: If I knew that, then I would have given a closer guidance, closer to minus 1% and closer to minus 6%, I don't. I think it just depends on turns. You still have to get turns, backlog, what happens in automotive, recovery. Do any of the sectors get worse? Do any of the sectors recover? Do better? It's just a lot of moving parts, and that's just a broad range of guidance.
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company: Okay, fair enough. And then, switching more to product-related questions, Ganesh. It looks like the 8-bit business, at least sequentially, has been flat or down over the last 3 to 4 quarters. You have had very good growth in the 32-bit business and the 16-bit business. What do you think is happening in 8-bit that's causing the divergence in trends between that part of the portfolio and the other?
Ganesh Moorthy: So, first of all, I think it's an incorrect assumption that 8-bit has been declining over many quarters. The last quarter was the only quarter in which we provided some information in terms of trajectory. 8-bit, as you've seen -- if you look at our 2010 results which gives you a fair amount of data as compared to 2009, had good growth year-over-year, has continued to have growth as we've gone into to 2011. And that we feel very good about 8-bit, its prospects for growth and how it's doing. So it has nothing other than the current broad-based weakness that we're seeing incorporated into the last quarter's results.
Steve Sanghi: Fiscal 2011 was a record year in 8-bit micro.
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company: In revenues, Steve? And are you talking Flash and non-Flash or just the Flash products?
Steve Sanghi: In total 8-bit microcontrollers. I know a lot of the models, they don't reflect that. That's just -- because you can't seem to get to that number or derive that number, but 8-bit microcontrollers were record in 2011.
J. Bjornholt: Right. And we said that on our earnings conference with the March results.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Ganesh, could you be so kind as to repeat what you said about the 16-bit business growth? I missed that. And then 2 questions on products. On the license revenue, how should we think about that? Is that a faster than a core growth business for you guys or slower? And then metal on cap touch controllers, you talked about that last quarter. Can you give us a sense about how big that is, and whether or not that's above your corporate average growth rate or below?
Ganesh Moorthy: Okay. So let me just divide, there are 3 different questions there. So on 16-bit, what I said is that the business sequentially was down 3.1% but was up 43% from the year-ago quarter. I'll let Steve talk about the licensing fees.
Steve Sanghi: The licensing business was up sequentially 1.3%. That's when actually, we break it out, it was $20.6 million for the quarter, up significantly year-over-year. I don't have that number handy. It was up quite significantly because that has continued to grow faster than Microchip so far.
J. Bjornholt: And with respect to metal over cap. The metal over cap is only one of multiple solutions we have that go into the touch market. It's hard for us to track exact revenue that goes into touch because it's a standard microcontroller that utilizes software either from us or from our customers. So it's pretty broad, there's over 1,000 different customers who are using our products in touch-related solutions, all in deeply-embedded applications, and that continues to perform to our expectations.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Can you give us a sense of how big that the total touch business is for you guys?
J. Bjornholt: We don't have a good number that I can give you and stand behind. We know it's broad-based. It's across a broad range of applications, and we can share perhaps some applications in which is going.
Steve Sanghi: We often get asked. We are not in a smartphones or something, where are we making up for this lots of customers. So here's some examples, in consumer electronics, we are in LCD TVs, computer monitors, gaming, set-top boxes, laptops, some tablet PCs in the buttons, remote controls, optical disk drives, audio components, stereo and Hi-Fi, industrial applications like automatic milking machines, popular in China, copier printer buttons, home appliances, washers, dryers, microwaves, coffeemakers, espresso machines, inductive cookers, stovetops. In automotive, we are in overhead controls, dashboard controls, lighting controls, climate controls, proximity detection. In industrial applications, we are in access controls, keypads, LED lighting controls, dimmers and switches. So it just gives you a broad sampling of large number of applications. And that's really where our microcontrollers also grow. That's the flavor of our business where we rather do business with thousand customers buying $100,000 each rather than one customer buying $10 million. Because the gross margin is a lot higher. They appreciate our business model and so on and so forth.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Gil Alexandre with Darphil & Associates.
Gilbert Alexandre: When you take a look at your 8-bit programmable microcontrollers, can you tell us your market share there? And over a cycle, what that sort of unit growth is in that business now?
Steve Sanghi: Gilbert, basically, if I give you that market share, it breaks out the numbers for 8-bit. And from there, one could decode the 16-bit because 32-bit is relatively small. And for competitive reasons -- we can't get those numbers up from TI. We can't get those numbers from Cypress, Silicon Lab, Atmel and others, and therefore, we cannot provide those. I think you can get color from -- I think we gave enough information that you can deduct from. There is some industry reports which can give you some idea. Most of the analyst split is wrong. So that doesn't work, but there's some reports which are closer, but we can't give you that market share.
Gilbert Alexandre: And for the -- okay, and you can't comment on the programmable microcontroller growth in the 8-bits?
Steve Sanghi: Programmable microcontroller growth in the 8-bit?
Gilbert Alexandre: Yes, sir.
Steve Sanghi: Well, the overall 8-bit business does not have a high growth total industry, but we have continuously gained share over the last many, many years. And the programmable sector has gained share over the non-programmable sector. I don't have any recent numbers by any published reports, what portion of the business now is programmable versus non-programmable. I think it's a very high percentage programmable now. So programmable in 8-bit growth are really starting to converge now. That was not the case 5 years ago.
Gilbert Alexandre: My last question. When you take a look at your inventory, you basically state comfortable with up to 140 days of inventory?
Steve Sanghi: I'll be comfortable even beyond that. I think it will basically depend on choosing what to build. We have 2,000 mask types. I can always choose to build inventory on those products which are, I mean, sure shot, very long lifetime. I'll be selling them 5 years from now, 10 years from now, and then if I build those products ahead of time, then I'm utilizing the equipment which will otherwise go unutilized, and therefore, it will help me to lower the capital expenditure in the coming cycle.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan.
Harsh Kumar - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.: Question for you Steve. Steve, on the last call, I think you mentioned that your industrial business was still holding up relatively well. I gather, listening to your commentary today, that, that has changed. If you can provide any color, we'd appreciate it.
Steve Sanghi: You're probably right. I think many other companies have confirmed also, the industrial business, is -- probably cannot be taken out as any different than the others today.
Harsh Kumar - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Steve, we value your macro opinion. Based on your conversations that you might have had with OEMs, do you think the OEMs are really getting worried about growth here? Or is it a game of chicken that based on short lead time such as yourself, as well as inventory that is abundantly available at distributors, they simply are not ordering or they don't feel like they have to order quickly?
Steve Sanghi: The OEMs are people. They are people making decisions. They're not machines. They are humans, and they watch the same TV. They see the same stock market. They see the same reports. There is lack of demand. There's lack of confidence. There's lack of willingness to invest. There's lack of job creation. On and on and on. Basically, I think it's that macro environment that's very lethargic.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Sujee De Silva with ThinkEquity.
Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC: On the Touch products, I'm curious. Are they a separate set of SKUs? Or Steve, with the touch feature -- function or feature in your broader products, you have a very broad adoption there. I'm just curious which way you go-to-market there?
Steve Sanghi: So we have some resistive screen touch controllers which have the special part names. So those are -- especially for a resistive screen touch controller, they still use our standard microcontrollers, but they sell as special products for the touch market. But the majority of all the rest of the capacity of touch products and all these applications that I talked about, customer buys the standard microcontrollers from Microchip just like they buy for any other application, and then they simply program that software in it. Either they program it in their factory or they ask us to burn it in and we can burn them in.
Ganesh Moorthy: In many cases, touch is one of many things that, that microcontrollers is doing. So it is providing other functions in the application and adding touch as one more function that it does.
Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC: Okay, that helps. Next question may be hard to answer now. In terms of the September quarter, are you expecting typical linearity in this environment, or are you guiding to perhaps a more back-end loaded September quarter than usual?
Steve Sanghi: I just can't get that far. In this kind of environment, I just don't know about December. I can only make comment on the automotive, which I made before, that I think recovery should continue and there should be a reasonable quarter from the automotive perspective. But for the rest of it, I think it's too early to be starting to call December.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Steve, I just had 2 quick follow-up questions. The first, if you could just take us through your top 3 or 4 end markets. And maybe give us your take on where you think they are in the correction. Are they all bad getting worse? It sounds like auto is improving a little bit, but industrial is starting to weaken. If you could just give us maybe 30 or 45 seconds on your take on each of your end markets.
Ganesh Moorthy: I think the summary you had and you started with, we know that automotive is starting to show the best signs of beginning to recover. I think industrial has weakened. I think consumer was weak, remains weak. And those are some of the largest segments that we're in. We're not as much in to office automation, although there has been a weakness that we showed -- that we talked about in July, and we don't see anything changing there of any consequence.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Sure. And then for my follow-up, just a clarification on inventory. Not disti inventory but channel inventory. Steve, is it your sense that channel inventory is low, going to even below normal? Is it normal now going to below normal? I guess, what is your sense on channel inventory out there for your products?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the channel inventory was what, 43 days, and it grew by 3 days last quarter, and it has been growing about a day or so every quarter. The channel inventory is not high. It's slightly high, but not very, very high. There's a significant trend going on where a large number of customers are starting to build a logistics program with the distributors where they want the distributors to carry the inventory and have that inventory be drawn at a moment's notice for them. So therefore, the customers are starting to keep less inventory which means the distributor has to keep more inventory, and we have to keep more inventory. So the distributor inventory may be up by a few days and may correct over the next couple of quarters, but it's not exceptionally high. And as the distributor inventory corrects, I have to keep saying that it does not affect our revenue.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital: Just a question for Steve. I don't want to deny that this is a weak market, but when you look at your June quarter, I think out of the semi companies you mentioned, you're the only one that is seeing a decline. And then when you look at the Q3 guidance, I think only Linear guided worse. So when you just look at the makeup of your end markets, maybe could you highlight? Is it the more just the exposure that you have, or you think it's a timing issue, or you maybe saw it first, then people will see a weaker Q4? Any color would be helpful.
Steve Sanghi: This music -- this record has to repeat how many times? I mean, I think it happened in 2004, 2006. Those who has been in the stock for 18 years, they will walk you through how we see this first and I explained it a couple of times already why we see it first. They'll come out later when you cumulatively look at it over 3 quarters, we'll be equal or better than many of this competitors and gain shares. We have demonstrated it many, many times. Yet every time it happens, it's a new question because there are new players, there are new analysts, it's a large churn. So I don't have that problem when I talk to somebody, even large investors who have been in there for a long period of time. And obviously, if you have questioned it on July 11, okay. If you're still questioning it after all these companies have said that their guidance is weak for this quarter, while just 3 or 4 weeks ago -- Just 3 or 4 weeks ago, a number of reports we had basically said that the other companies were not confirming that there is a problem on the horizon, channel checks we're saying that the rest of the companies are doing fine. It was a Microchip problem, 4 weeks later, it's not true. If you're still questioning it, I can't change your mind.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital: I guess, what I'm saying is on a relative basis. I'm not disagreeing that things are weak. But clearly, I mean, you just saw Atmel last night. They have touch, but even outside of touch, it's not as weak. I'm just trying to figure out the timing. And then, when you look at December, do you think you're coming out of it first and then some of these other companies have to catch up?
Steve Sanghi: Every company has a different seasonality and different markets and so Linear set down 6% to 8%. So they were worse than ours. So you have to accumulate it over a period of time. I can't pick just one company. But if you look at the industry, look at -- I rattled lots of different companies and they're all seeing similar. Look at their prior guidance, look at their current guidance. Silicon lab said down 5% to down 10% with the middle point of 7.5% and they have microcontrollers and they're a competitor too. So you can always pick somebody who's better. Look at TSMC's guidance. Look at UMC's guidance, UMC said down 20%, I think. Low teens, and TMC's said what? 7% and they are suppliers to the industry. So I think tea leaves are here to read. That's just your interpretation, and I'm not the analyst, you are.
J. Bjornholt: Blayne, I think the way to think about it is we will see this early on both sides of the cycle. So we're on the early side of the cycle, but I think when this bottoms out and turns, you'll see that we're among the early people to see on the upside as well.
Operator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back to our moderators for any closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: So that's all we have for you today. We'll be going to some conferences. I think Gordon is going to a conference next week.
J. Bjornholt: To Morgan Keegan.
Steve Sanghi: Morgan Keegan conference, so there'll be a chance to interface with him and go deeper into some of these things if you like. And then we'll see you, some of you later in the quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Sanghi: Good afternoon, everyone. We'll have our CFO, Eric Bjornholt, start the call. Eric?
J. Bjornholt: During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events for the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip’s COO; and Gordon Parnell, Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. I will comment on our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2011 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results. I will be referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis, prior to the effects of share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses.  Net sales in the March 2011 quarter were $380 million, and were up 3.3% from net sales of $367.8 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and were up 36.7% from net sales of $278 million in the March 2010 quarter.  Net sales in the quarter included approximately $2 million from Microchip's acquisition of Millennium Microtech Thailand, also known as MMT, a provider of assembly and test services for semiconductor manufacturers, including Microchip, which Ganesh will discuss later in this call. Excluding the MMT acquisition, net sales in the March quarter were up 2.8%, near the high end of our guidance. Net sales for fiscal 2011 were $1.487 billion, up 56.9% from the fiscal 2010 levels. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 60.2% in the March quarter, an increase from 59.8% achieved in the preceding quarter, and above the high end of our guidance. Operating expenses were 24.1% of sales, and operating income was 36.1% of sales. Net income from continuing operations was $119 million or $0.59 per diluted share, which was also above the high end of our guidance. I would like to highlight that Microchip achieved $0.59 of non-GAAP EPS, excluding the MMT acquisition. MMT was accretive but did not move the needle on EPS. I want to remind investors and analysts that fluctuations in Microchip's share price impacted diluted shares outstanding used in our earnings per share calculations. The average share price of Microchip's stock in the March quarter was significantly higher than the average price in the December quarter. This resulted in a higher share count in part because incremental shares are included in the EPS denominator from Microchip's outstanding convertible debentures. Dilution from the convertible occurs at average quarterly share prices above $29.04, which is the current conversion price. We have updated the schedule on the supplemental financial information section of the Investor Relations page of our website that shows what the incremental share count from the convertible debt will be at various share prices. This should continue to be helpful to investors and analysts when trying to estimate the impact of share count increases on earnings per share. Our financial guidance for the June quarter is based on an average Microchip's share price of $40 for the June quarter to calculate the additional dilutive effect from the convertible debt.  The negative impact on the earnings per share calculation from the difference in the assumed average stock price for the June 2011 quarter compared to the March 2011 quarter is about $0.01. Investors and analysts should refer to the table on our website if they want to model the diluted shares outstanding using a different average share price for the June quarter. For fiscal 2011, on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 60.1%, an increase from the 57.4% achieved in fiscal 2010. Operating expenses were 24.2% of sales, and operating income was 35.9% of sales. Net income from continuing operations was $462.3 million or $2.39 per diluted share compared to $1.32 per share in fiscal 2010. On a full GAAP basis in the March 2011 quarter, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 59.4%. Total operating expenses were $101.2 million or 26.6% of sales, and included share-based compensation of $7.6 million and acquisition-related expenses of $2.1 million. GAAP net income from continuing operations was $130.6 million or $0.65 per diluted share, and includes a onetime favorable tax benefit of $24.4 million, which includes the settlement of an IRS audit and other onetime tax events. There was a net loss from discontinued operations of $5.1 million in the March quarter. For fiscal 2011, GAAP gross margins were 58.8%, an increase from 56.4% achieved in fiscal 2010. GAAP operating expenses were 26.9% of sales, and GAAP operating income was 31.9% of sales. GAAP net income from continuing operations was $429.2 million or $2.20 per diluted share compared to $1.16 per share in fiscal 2010. The net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 was $10.2 million.  In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.7%, and the GAAP tax rate benefit was 8.8%. The GAAP tax rate was impacted by a favorable settlement with the IRS for fiscal years 2006 through 2008, a charge for tax restructuring and the release of a previously reserved item due to the statute of limitations expiring. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax-advantaged securities. We expect our combined forward-looking effect of tax rate to be about 12.25% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the March quarter, share-based compensation was about $0.04, acquisition-related items were about $0.019, noncash interest expense was about $0.005 and the benefit from the tax matters discussed earlier was about $0.121. The dividend declared today of $0.346 per share will be paid on June 2, 2011 to shareholders of record on May 19, 2011. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $65.7 million.  Moving on to the balance sheet. Microchip's inventory at March 31, 2011 was $180.8 million or 107 days, flat in days to the prior quarter level. We have stated that our internal target for inventory days is 115, and we will continue to build inventory towards that target to maintain short lead times and support our customers' delivery requirements. This has been a successful competitive advantage for Microchip over many cycles, and we expect similar positive results from our customers in the market. Inventory at our distributors was 40 days, which is up one day from the prior quarter level. At March 31, Microchip's accounts receivables balance was $181.2 million, a decrease of 3.3% from the balance of as of the end of December.  Receivable balances are in great condition with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. As of March 31, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1.71 billion, and was up about $135 million from the prior-quarter levels. Our cash generation continues to be strong, and our total cash and investment position is projected to grow by approximately $115 million to $125 million in the June quarter, prior to the dividend payment. Capital spending was approximately $24.3 million for the March quarter and $124.5 million for fiscal 2011, about $5 million less than what we had communicated in our last earnings call, due to the rollover of some of this capital into the first quarter of fiscal 2012. We are continuing to invest in equipment to support the revenue growth of our new products and technologies, and our capital expenditure forecast for fiscal 2012 is about $125 million. And we expect the capital expenditures to be about $37 million in the June quarter. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $22.8 million, which was down from depreciation of $23.6 million in the December quarter. Depreciation expense for fiscal 2011 was $92.7 million compared to $86.4 million in fiscal 2010.  I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our product lines and starting with microcontrollers. Our Microcontroller business performed at the high end of our expectations, with revenue up 4% on a sequential basis and up 17% from the year-ago quarter to set a new record. For fiscal year '11, which ended on March 31, our Microcontroller business was up 32% over fiscal year '10, breaking through the $1 billion revenue mark for the first time ever and setting a new record in the process. Our 8-bit Microcontroller business was strong and delivered solid results for the quarter, as well as for the fiscal year. Our 16-bit Microcontroller business was up 24% sequentially and was up 86% from the year-ago quarter, setting a new record. For fiscal year '11, our 16-bit Microcontroller business was up 102%, more than doubling over the fiscal year '10 revenue and setting a new record. New customers and new designs continue to go into production, as a number of volume 16-bit customers grew to over 3,700 customers.  Our 32-bit Microcontroller business had another strong quarter of growth in the March quarter, up 35% on a sequential basis and up 226% from the year-ago quarter to achieve a new record. For fiscal year '11, our 32-bit Microcontroller business was up 257%, much more than triple the fiscal year '10 revenue and also set a new record. The number of customers in volume production grew by over 11% to 584, as we continue to build a broad base of customers to grow this business.  Moving to Development Tools. We shipped over 44,000 development tools in the March quarter. In fiscal year '11, we shipped a record number of development tools with over 183,000 tools shipped. Development Tools sales remained an excellent leading indicator of continued strong design and activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers and the continued trend of strong Development Tools sales bodes well for future growth. About a month ago, Gartner Dataquest released the microcontroller market share report for 2010. Despite gaining market share again, for the first time in 5 years, Microchip dropped to the #2 position for 8-bit microcontrollers, due entirely to the merger of NEC and Renesas in 2010.  Renesas itself was formed several years ago through the merger of Hitachi and Mitsubishi. And it is interesting to note that it has taken the combination of 3 Japanese semiconductor giants, NEC, Hitachi and Mitsubishi to knock us off the #1 spot. Be assured that we will not rest, and we will work relentlessly to continue to gain 8-bit market share, and we fully expect to wrest back the #1 spot in the coming years. Also based on Gartner's report and our assessment, the outstanding growth in our 16-bit microcontrollers enabled us to move up 2 more spots to the #8 position. We estimate that we were by far the fastest growing provider of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in 2010.  Last but not least, based on Gartner's report, and excluding Smart Card shipments, Microchip is now the third largest microcontrollers supplier in the world. Also within the last month, EE Times released the results of their annual Embedded Market Study. Once again, Microchip was rated by embedded system design engineers as their #1 choice for 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers. And for the first time, we were also their #1 choice for 32-bit microcontrollers in the segment of the market that we serve. So whether you look at the historical data, as measured by Gartner Dataquest, or the forward-looking data as measured by the EE Times study, customers continue to show a strong preference for Microchip's microcontroller solutions. Now let's move to our Analog business. This business was up 3.5% sequentially, and was up 45% from the year-ago quarter. For fiscal year '11, our Analog business was up a strong 78% to set a new record. We are very pleased with the design win and revenue momentum our Analog business had shown. And we are now up to almost 17,500 customers who are buying Analog solutions. We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new products, which we expect will contribute to continued strong revenue growth. Moving to our Memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash memory products, this business was down 5% on a sequential basis. We continue to run our Memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. There had been some questions and concerns about the impact of the Japan earthquake on our supply chain. Our current assessment remains consistent with our initial assessment, that we expect no disruption in our supply lines. Through a combination of well thought-out sourcing strategies, effective contingency plans and a little bit of luck, we are in the fortunate position of not only being able to continue our operation uninterrupted but to also initiate actions to increase supply, so that we can take up some of the slack for industry manufacturing capacity that has been lost. During the March quarter, we completed the acquisition of Millennium Microtech Thailand, also known as MMT. MMT is a provider of assembly and test services for semiconductor manufacturers including Microchip. They are also one of the 2 major providers worldwide of extremely specialized assembly and test services for high reliability applications. Microchip's existing facility in Thailand had room left to support about another 2 to 3 years of growth, but we were facing a decision whether to buy or build another factory. The acquisition of MMT gives us our second factory, with a ready-made trained staff and substantial room for future expansion, all at a fraction of the cost of starting from a greenfield. The acquisition of MMT also immediately gives us lower cost from the service that they were providing Microchip, as well as the small but highly profitable business providing specialized assembly and test services. MMT added about $2 million to our revenue in the March quarter, and is expected to add about $4 million in the June quarter, reflecting the full quarter. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the effect of earthquake and tsunami in Japan on our business, then I will reflect on the overall March quarter results. And finally, I will talk about our guidance for the June 2011 quarter. The devastation caused by the earthquakes, tsunami and the nuclear threat on Japan's people and resources is unprecedented. Our sympathy and prayers continue to be for the Japanese people. As far as the impact of these events on our business is concerned, it was multi-faceted. First, we received some push outs of orders scheduled for shipment in March. Some of these push outs were sales out from distribution in Japan. The other push outs were from factories in U.S. that were shut down due to lack of piece parts. We believe that this impact was a total of about $2 million to $3 million on the revenue for March quarter. And this impact is not recoverable because the factories are not going to overbill to make up for it. The impact for June quarter may be a bit larger due to the full quarter. As we look forward, we see 2 types of impacts. The first impact is negative and is the same kind of impact we saw in March quarter, namely, lower demand in Japan and the impact of shortage of Japanese piece parts. The second impact is very positive, which is driven by customers looking for substitution parts from Microchip when they cannot get them from impacted factories in Japan. We have been inundated by inquiries from customers wanting to substitute product. We are actively providing technical support to help customers execute their redesigns. We have booked a few orders for such substitution already, and many more redesigns are underway. We have also been getting very strong bookings from our existing customers who are concerned about potential shortages developing in the market. It is difficult to tell the net impact of these 2 opposing effects. Therefore, our guidance will be wider than normal. As I reflect on the overall revenue for the quarter, we are very pleased to have hit near the high end of our guidance on net sales, despite losing some revenue opportunity due to the Japan issue.  Gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and non-GAAP earnings per share all exceeded the high end of the guidance range. Our licensing revenue was up 6.9% sequentially and reached another all-time record of $20.4 million in the March quarter.  Our overall microcontroller revenue, our 16-bit microcontroller revenue and 32-bit revenue, all hit new all-time records with impressive growths in 16-bit, as well as 32-bit revenues. At the present time, our 32-bit revenue slightly exceeds our 16-bit revenue when compared to the same number of quarters after introduction. So our penetration in 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers and overall market share in microcontrollers continue to progress very nicely.  The March quarter also marked our 82nd consecutive profitable quarter, and is a testimony to the resilience of the business model, resiliency of the business model that we have fine-tuned over time.  Looking at the fiscal year 2011. We closed the year with a record revenue of $1.487 billion, which was up 57% from prior year. We also made new records in all strategic product lines. Our 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit microcontrollers and Analog revenues all hit new full year revenue records. We also achieved record non-GAAP EPS of $2.39, which was up 81% from prior year. It was one of our best growth years ever. I want to thank the entire Microchip team for a job very well done. I also want to thank our customers for their continued trust in Microchip's solutions. I also want to say that some of you were concerned about a deep inventory correction. We did complete the inventory correction in one quarter back in December and then grew in the March quarter.  I will now provide guidance for the June 2011 quarter. First, we have proven again that book-to-bill ratio has no correlation to the following quarter's revenue. Coming out of the December quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was 0.77. We gave a guidance of revenue growth of 1.5% at the midpoint for the March quarter, pointing to the 0.77 book-to-bill ratio, some of you doubted that guidance. We achieved near the high end of that guidance despite losing some revenue opportunities related to Japan. So we have proven one more time and for the last time that book-to-bill ratio does not correlate to the revenue in the following quarter. The book-to-bill ratio just causes unnecessary confusion regarding the outlook. We had excellent bookings in the March quarter, so now will be a good time to stop providing book-to-bill ratio going forward. In addition, April saw best bookings ever for the first month of the quarter.  As I mentioned earlier, our guidance will be wider than normal because of the opposing negative and positive effects of Japan crisis. There are a large number of design conversions underway, which will have a positive ongoing effect. The only question is how many of these designs will bring production orders in the current quarter? After reviewing these factors and after a comprehensive bottoms-up look of our business worldwide, we expect the June quarter revenue to be up 1% to 6% sequentially.  We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 60.3% for June quarter. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.58 and $0.62. Earnings per share assumes an average Microchip stock price of $40 in the quarter, which adds 3.4 million shares to our share count from the March quarter.  The total net earnings in dollars at the midpoint of the guidance are expected to be up about $3.5 million or about $0.02 per share increase at a constant share count. Given all the complications of accounting for the SST acquisition done last year, including amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges and sale of our non-core businesses like many other companies have done, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its reserves on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results will provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we expect that the -- and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. With that, operator, would you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan.
Harsh Kumar - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.: Two questions. Steve, you had a pretty steady Auto business from many years ago, and I assume it's continuing to be steady up to maybe some of the libations now because of Japan. It's not showing up in your numbers, obviously, you're doing very well. Could you maybe provide some color still on what that impact is -- Auto is for you? And how you're able to overcome some of the obvious weakness that's coming out of Japan.
Steve Sanghi: Well we have a fairly significant and a very steady and very profitable and very good Automotive business, in which we sell microcontrollers, Analog and memory, so all our products. The $2 million to $3 million Japan impact that I described, a fair amount of that really is in the Automotive segment. And we continue for that to happen again in the June quarter, and I think recovery will begin after that. So the guess in Automotive is that June quarter would be weak. September quarter could be some recovery beginning, and then December quarter could be a significant recovery making up in the year, most of what was lost but maybe not all of it.
Harsh Kumar - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.: Fair enough. And then I think in the past, you very publicly mentioned you're not interested in cell phones, tablets, any of the sort of the high-flying consumer products. The question relates to touch, Steve, what -- maybe you could highlight what areas you're targeting or what areas you're most excited about within touch for your business?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's in a broad base of embedded applications that we're in. They are used in industrial applications. They are used in automotive applications. Any number of devices that have a graphical interface that can sometimes need a touch interface to them, those are all the things we have interest. We have 700, 800 applications that are in production with our touch technologies, and they are the most mundane of applications that you would expect at all our standard embedded applications. So anything about a cell phone, tablet kind of application is one we're interested and one that fits with our business model.
Harsh Kumar - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. I'll come back.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Congratulations on weathering the issues from Japan. Just very quickly, with the orders that you're getting, you said you're inundated by requests. How long does the qualification period last for things like automotive, and if your able to fulfill some of these orders, how quickly should we expect it to start to reflect in your revenues? I know you've got some already in the June quarter. But I just want to know, of the ones you deferred to [ph], how much do you think?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, so the disruption in supply chain from Japanese parts and Japanese competitors is not only going to be in automotive. As you get down here in the coming quarters, the next 2 quarters, it's going to be broad-based, consumer, industrial, automotive, telecom, everywhere. And it will be application-by-application. Certain applications that can be qualified very, very quickly and there are certain other applications like automotive that have historically taken longer. Now just last week, I was with a very, very senior executive of a very large automotive company in U.S. We'll not name beyond that. And I asked him how he sees the impact of Japan, and his answer was that when the earthquake happened on March 11 -- you usually have couple of months of supply line pass through the fab already, either the wafers are in assembly or test or finished goods or whatever. So he says the first couple of months were relatively okay. There were minor problems here and there. But the 2 months anniversary is just about coming up next week, and he expects that things to get much tighter here in the coming weeks for the next couple of quarters. So I asked him, and I said, "Well, we can help you if we can get some assistance in really getting these parts qualified." And often it takes a fair amount of time to get the parts qualified in automotive. And his answer, I was totally surprised by, he said, "Yes, it usually takes that long because you want that qualification unchanged. This time, we will want it." And I just did not expect that answer from an automotive executive when he said, "Well this time, we will want that changed very quickly and we'll help push it through." And lo and behold, we have one I definitely know of and there are few others in the works that has already qualified the parts, and we have received production orders for shipment in June. So that's as fast as it can happen but will be all at different flavors. Some will be quick and some will take longer. But I think the positive impact of that in September quarter is for sure. And I think in June quarter, is a toss up on what the negative impact would be and how much of the positive impact we can pull through.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: That's a great answer. Let me just ask you one follow-up. One of the reactions we had wondered is whether this de-stock in general goes up across the sector, and there are articles questioning whether adjusted time in manufacturing is relevant going forward, and will people now have to hold structurally higher inventory. Do you expect any change to the behavior of inventory holding behavior causing the industry going forward? Do you expect inventory levels to be higher now, as people try to be careful to avoid being caught up like you did last time?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think time will tell. We historically have held 115 days of inventory, which is really our model, although it's never really that exactly. It's either lower, and we're trying to build towards it, or it's higher and we're to reduce from it. In 115 days of inventory, we can serve our customers fairly well with short lead times. Now the question is will the customers themselves now hold higher inventory because of this crisis? My feeling is if customers had held 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks of more inventory, that really wouldn't have saved. So this is what I would call a six sigma event, almost. It just didn't happen every day, and our all-learned behaviors will go out of the window. I think it's unlikely. I think we'll get through it, and then business will continue as normal.
Operator: We'll take our next question from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Related to all the questions that are asked before on the supply impact, can you talk about the impact of your lead times right now? You mentioned they were low. Do you expect them to stay at these current levels over the next couple of quarters, as you get that request from other customers?
Ganesh Moorthy: Our lead times really have not changed. They're not pushing out, and a lot depends on how much backlog gets placed. But anticipating some of the growth that Steve described from these dislocations, we are preparing for it, and we expect lead times will be stable.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. And then this is a quick follow-up. Eric, maybe you can address where you are in terms of OpEx today. I think you're kind of in the -- towards the lower end of your 24 to 26 band if I'm remember correctly. Are there any investments or special areas of focus for you where you look to increase that percentage of OpEx, especially in the R&D line going forward?
J. Bjornholt: No, Jim, there isn't anything that I would highlight specifically but we obviously are continuing to focus on getting the correct resources in place to drive our R&D and sales activities for the long haul. So we are at the low end of what our range is. And yes, that's what we're guiding to, again, for the June quarter.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Terence Whalen with Citi.
Bin Jiang: This is Bin speaking for Terence. Could you -- you mentioned the March quarter, it's best than ever first quarter this year. Could you comment that other trend from January to March and into April, do you see improving other trend, especially after the Japan's earthquake, there are more customers stocking driving this trend?
Steve Sanghi: Let me correct first what you've heard. We didn't say that March quarter was best first quarter ever. I said the bookings in the month of April were the best booking month ever for the first month of the quarter.
Bin Jiang: I got you. Thanks for that.
Steve Sanghi: To compare April to January; April, July and October, ever in our history, April was the best booking month. Was that somewhat impacted by people's concern regarding the Japan situation? Very likely, displacement and all that. There's a lot of moving parts, but our guidance itself for this quarter will take us to the record sales level. So for that, we should be booking at the record level, but it has started out very, very strong.
Bin Jiang: All right. My follow-up question, do you see any impact to the gross margin from this Japan issue, especially when customers try to give [ph] their safety stock?
Steve Sanghi: We do not -- our Japan business is very small. So the impact, the positive impact is likely to be larger outside of Japan where the people in U.S., Europe and Asia are trying to replace the Japanese parts which they can't get. And they're likely to be in the similar mix where our current business is, and we do not expect any impact on gross margin.
Bin Jiang: Okay. Fair enough.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just expanding on that last comment. I was wondering if these changes in Japan, if that's going to create an opportunity for you to build relationships with the Japanese OEMs?
Steve Sanghi: The answer to that is yes. We are getting inquiries and some look-ins in Japan also. But there's a 300-year history, and I think when this thing is all over, Japan will continue to buy from their own company first. Then other Japanese companies second and the foreigners, third. So incrementally, will it be positive? Yes, but I don't expect there'll be huge, huge change in the Japanese behavior that will last.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And maybe if I could just turn over to the acquisition of MMT. Which products were they doing assembly and test for you already?
J. Bjornholt: It's not so much product, but there were certain range of packages that they were doing for us. There are multiple products that might fit into those packages. There were microcontrollers, there were memory products, so it was just a range of our products in a specific set of packages that they were making.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, and maybe if I could just ask one more on that. What percentage of their business was Microchip's?
J. Bjornholt: That's not information we necessarily want to make public.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Cody Acree with Williams Financial.
Cody Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc.: Steve, maybe going back to the April quarter or the April month strength in orders, what's your view that, that bump in orders is a build of safety stock that might really not reflect underlying demand?
Steve Sanghi: Well like I said before, there are a lot of moving parts. Our guidance itself for the current quarter will take us to a record quarter. So for that, we should be booking at the rate of record booking. On the top of that, you add some situation orders on the substitution parts. And on the top of that, you add some orders from our existing customers who are trying to lock in their deliveries, and you get the result you get. We don't see a sign that people are really necessarily building an inventory anywhere.
J. Bjornholt: Yes, the one point I would add is if I look at the aging for the bookings that are coming in, there's nothing abnormal in the aging that we are seeing. So it does look like what we would have seen in a normal April, with an elevated level of risk the bookings are coming in.
Cody Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc.: Right. Thanks a lot. And then, just on your 16-bit and 32-bit strength, any particular end markets that are driving that?
J. Bjornholt: No. We have never been end market focused on these things. We have 3,700 customers in 16-bit. Almost 600 customers on 32-bit. They spread across a wide range of applications and across all the end markets we serve. And that's exactly how we like the business to be.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Sumit Dhanda with Citadel Securities.
Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC: Steve, a couple of questions. In terms of the traction you're getting with customer redesigns in your favor, is there any way for you to try to quantify what that might mean long term for your business, in terms of driving incremental growth? Or is that too hard to do?
Steve Sanghi: Well, it's not too hard to do. In our sales operating system, we have a substantial database, and we track every opportunity from discovery stage to as it goes through design wins and eventually get to order. And we have pages and pages of single sales line item as opportunities that we're tracking and investing resources to help our customers design. So we do have internal capability to model it, but it's not something we're going to share.
J. Bjornholt: So maybe the most positive way to think about this is we're getting looks from many customers that have been strongholds for some of the competitive products that we did not have an opportunity to engage with before. And I think that's where the long-term benefits will come from.
Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC: Okay. And just as a follow-up since you brought up competition, your growth has been extremely impressive, but at most, it seems to have outgrown you pretty handily. If you look over the past 5 years, their business has doubled. You've done well. Are there markets that they're addressing, which you think you should be in? Or how do we think about the fact that their microcontroller business is now actually larger than yours although they started from much smaller base a few years ago?
Steve Sanghi: I think, Sumit, we are very satisfied with our performance. Our Microcontroller business was up huge last year. We have 20 years of record of making records in the Microcontroller business every year and 82 quarters of profitability. And there are plenty of smaller and larger players that can have a good year, a bad year or hit a given market, it could be margin differences. If my business was to go down to 50% gross margin from 60.3% it was last quarter, I'm very confident you will like it. So we have a model. We are very successful. Lots of investors over long term have held our stock, and they're very, very pleased with it. You will happen to not like it, and that's how it goes, and we can't please everybody.
Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC: Okay. Thank you so much, Steve.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company: I just wanted to first dig into some of the activity in the business since mid-March. So with Development Tools being a good leading indicator, have you seen Development Tools pick up since then? And did you get a regional look at that, and did you see a pickup in the Japan area?
Ganesh Moorthy: So Development Tools are really not the best indicator to reflect on what Japan specific activity would be. Clearly, if we had new customers who have not used our products before, development tools will pick up there. But there's nothing in that trend that would give us information to predict what is going to happen as a result of Japan. It's really the customer engagements, the opportunity-by-opportunity that we're working, the places where we know timelines that they're working to complete designs, go to production, and that's really where we see the Japan upside coming from.
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company: And it sounded like from Steve's earlier description that, that would be across your 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit businesses. Is that fair, Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Absolutely.
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company: Okay, and then just as a follow-up for Eric. It sounds like sequential revenue growth is going to be tail wind to gross margin, and the company would like to build inventory up to its target inventory base level. Are there any headwinds sequentially to gross margin?
J. Bjornholt: No. I think the one thing I will point out this last quarter, which helped us beat our guidance was that it was a very good product mix. Right? So our microcontroller division has grew. The licensing division grew, and the memory products were down. And then Asia, which tends to have a little lower gross margin than the rest of the business, was down because of the Lunar New Year. Now if Asia pops back this quarter with -- and not being a holiday period, that has a negative impact on gross margin. You can see that we are guiding to be up just slightly to a 60.3% non-GAAP gross margin this quarter. But then yes, I would say that's kind of a normal activity to seasonality that we've seen historically.
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company: That's helpful, Eric.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Barton with Cowen.
John Barton - Cowen and Company, LLC: On the topic of touch, Ganesh, you talked about the broad markets that you would address outside of handsets and tablets, et cetera. I believe you also got an EDN award for mTouch recently. Can you elaborate on the attributes of the technology that secured that award, please?
Ganesh Moorthy: You're absolutely correct. We just, in fact, earlier this week is when the award was given to us. It's a specific implementation of touch called, Metal Over Cap, and what it provides is an ability to do capacitive touch on a range of different materials. So this is a touch technology, not touchscreen, this is touch for buttons and sliders and that type of thing. It just extends the range of touch capabilities we're providing. This being the most recent innovation that we brought to market that has a lot of customer success and now some critical acclaim as well.
Steve Sanghi: What the Metal Over Cap really allows you to do is really a complete, smooth metal surface. Think of an appliance, an industrial equipment, it had any buttons, just a complete metal surface, and there are just touch spots on it, drawn out where you can touch and make the connection versus the usual touch on a screen or something required. You can do it on metal. So this is the only technology that you actually can go through pure metal to make the touch, and it's very, very required in lot of industrial applications.
John Barton - Cowen and Company, LLC: As a follow-up to that. Just in general, when you think about the capabilities of touch and the microcontroller families, does it represent a substantial increase to ASPs, or is it a necessity in order to address that portion of the sample?
Steve Sanghi: It will often depend on whether the customer is just using a part just to do touch and he has a different microcontroller for his rest of the -- call it the rest of his application, whatever he is trying to do, or he combines everything into one part, and you can really do both. In our case, our touch can be implemented in a wide variety of microcontrollers of Microchip: 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit. So it gives you much more capability to combine those 2 together, to do the main application, as well as the touch with a single microcontroller. And that will enhance the ASP. Some others provide just a fewer black box solution where you cannot fiddle with it, and it's just pure ASIC chip, and it only does touch. In that case, it will require a separate microcontroller to do the other function of your applications. And there, you would have bifurcation depending on what you can charge. So this would be kind of -- depends application-by-application and customer-by-customer.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Susquehanna.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Just wondering if you could clarify some of the assumptions made in your guidance, and you talk about some of the positive potentials from what's going on in Japan and some of negatives. At the midpoint of guidance, are you assuming a net neutral effect of these? Or have you assumed some negative effect?
Steve Sanghi: We're not going to get pinned down in our own guidance in the box. If you were to really be that precise, we could have just given you a number and we're not able to.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: So I mean is it just baked into the range, and I guess it's just to say it -- I guess that'd be in the case where we're assuming kind of neutral at this point?
Steve Sanghi: You're trying to put words in my mouth.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay. All right. Let me move on then. I guess some of us have the opportunity to take a look at the letter that you issued to your customers on your website during the quarter, in response to some of this. And I think the net of it was sort of asking the customers to provide a bit more visibility going out. I just wonder what the feedback was from the customers on that, and what you actually saw them do as a result of your call to action?
Steve Sanghi: Well the feedback was universally positive from around the world. First, in a very clear fashion, we communicated with our direct as well as distribution customers regarding Microchip was not impacted, our supply chain was not impacted. We did not have factories in Japan from where our product came. And number two, informing them that lots and lots of people are looking for substitution parts. And if I were to start committing our availability to the customers, who're looking for substitution parts, we could have a situation where my own customers who have designed in the product well ahead of time don't have the supply because I gave it to somebody else. So I asked them to give us visibility regarding what your needs are for the current quarter, so I can more appropriately assess what my excess availability is, with which then I can help the other customers. So the process has been very helpful. Some people have given us the orders, but many other people have given us forecast or visibility and other way are engaged into conversations regarding that their business continues uninterrupted, and they will need the same number of parts as last quarter, will need slightly more, or here's a new design or whatever. So I think the interaction has been very positive.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: And I guess on that, did you actually see an increase in bookings for quarters further out as a result of that as well?
Steve Sanghi: We have seen the strength in bookings, yes.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.
Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: Question on your substitution parts or second sourcing that potentially you're getting from some customers. Do you think that's going to help you offset some of the normal seasonality that you see in the December quarter in terms of the qualification process that will be kicking in, maybe in the December quarter?
Steve Sanghi: We don't know. It's too far. There are all these questions regarding how soon the recovery from Japanese supply chain would happen, how many customers will actually complete their qualification and by parts, how many customers will remain with us afterwards. And when the Japan supply comes back, they wouldn't go back. Now the history shows that in the other industry cycles, when lead times have become very long from our competitors and Microchip through our inventory strategy, kept short lead times and we won customers, we have kept those customers, and our business has grown into every cycle. So I'm fairly confident that we'll keep a large number of customers, but we won't keep all of them. Never before in the supply chain it was as much because of Japanese parts. So that's the new thing this time. The customers in Japan and the supply of the Japanese parts. So it's a different phenomena, and we have never been here before. So we are prepared to have the availability to help our customers, and we will do a very good job for them and try to win the next design as well as keep the current design. But to project that far out and then not knowing how soon the Japanese supply lines will recover, it's very hard to answer that question.
Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: Okay. And then, I guess, my last question is on of the gross margins, getting close up to the 60% range is going to be tougher and tougher to get incremental gains. But do you expect to see some incremental gross margin improvement over the fiscal year?
Steve Sanghi: We do expect to see some incremental gross margin, small incremental gross margin improvement over the year, yes. It's largely driven by product mix because the microcontrollers and Analog products and licensing are largely providing bulk of the growth for the company, as our Memory business is not as strategic, and we cherry pick it and manage it for very high profitability. So over time, mix gets richer and microcontroller and Analog margins are higher.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask if you could provide a little color on the strength in the quarter. I know it's hard to break out by end market for you, but if there are any particular areas that were strong either in your end market or geography. And then, the strength in the April bookings, it sound like you did a pretty comprehensive bottoms up. Would you -- netting the Japan impacts out, is that still -- would you characterize it as a strong bookings month?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. It would be a strong bookings month. Although I don't know if you know how to net it out. But it was a strong bookings month by any way you look at it. In terms of the pockets of strength, we do not break our business out by vertical markets nor do we look at it that way. We have 70,000-plus customers. Our business is very, very horizontal. But looking at product lines and geographies, we do expect strength in China. China is usually weak in March quarter because of the Lunar New Year holiday. So just coming from that into the June quarter, you have significant more number of working days. And we expect China to drive significant growth for the current quarter. Europe was very strong last quarter. What Was Europe up what quarter?
J. Bjornholt: 16.5%.
Steve Sanghi: So Europe was up sequentially 16.5%. And usually June is a flattish quarter for them. So those are couple of pointers there, as well as product lines are concerned, we expect the microcontrollers to do very well, make it another all-time record and Analog also should do a good growth and Memory to be moderate.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital: Great, and then on just the inventory, I apologize if you broke it out, where that stands and then given the disruption, whether you're expected to increase and then any color as far as customer inventory levels as well. You indicated that sort of recoveries have, any color would be appreciated.
Ganesh Moorthy: I don't expect the distribution in inventory to make any major change in either direction. Whether it was down today or up today, those are minor movements. It largely will depend on how much they're able to sell it out and take advantage of the upside and if they sell out a lot, it could down a little bit or it could go up a little bit, it will be the same. So I would not taken any start in it.
J. Bjornholt: And it was up one day at last quarter, and it is 40 days, up from 39.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Shaon Baqui - JP Morgan Chase & Co: It's Shaon Baqui calling in for Chris. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just want to circle back on the gross margin guidance here real quick. I notice you got revenues up and margins flattish for this quarter. Could you kind of walk us through some of the puts and takes there? Is it all mixed or just utilization going up or down this quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the mix by product line would be better. And there's a normal improvement in gross margin by just the normal cost reductions in manufacturing yield improvements and others. So those are the positive factors. And the negative factor, as Eric earlier described, the March quarter is the weak quarter in Asia and June quarter is a very strong quarter in Asia. And Asia gross margins are lower than the rest of the world. So that's a net negative for the June quarter. When you balance it all out, I think we expect a flattish to slight improvement in the gross margin.
J. Bjornholt: Yes, we got it up at 0.1%.
Steve Sanghi: 0.1% up.
Shaon Baqui - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay, very helpful. And this is a quick follow-up, just a housekeeping item. It looks like the discontinued item -- discontinued operations loss was a little higher than what we had expected, can you talk a little bit about what drove that, and how we should think about that for this quarter and going forward?
J. Bjornholt: So this charge in the last quarter relates to the business that we licensed to PCT, as part of the SST restructuring. There was product that we started with our foundry partners and anticipation of PCT's product needs. And that market that they service for these products, that they sell into has not performed well over the last several quarters. And it turns out that PCT does not need to purchase that inventory from us. So there's been a reduction in demand in the market, which drove us to have a charge for inventory for that particular operation.
Shaon Baqui - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. Great. That's helpful.
J. Bjornholt: This is the last quarter, the March quarter that we'll have anything in discontinued operations.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess either for Steve or for Eric. I know you guys have guided gross margin's up modestly here in the June quarter. But as we think about kind of the longer-term targets, you guys have done a nice job since the first full quarter of SSTI picking gross margins up. Should we think that kind of 60%, 61% is the right target? Or are there levers that you guys can pull to have margins to get back to where they were pre-SSTI?
Steve Sanghi: Pre-SST gross margins were 61.5%, right?
J. Bjornholt: Yes.
Steve Sanghi: And so from where we're talking about, we're basically talking about 100 basis points, and we added substantial SST business. Some of it was at the lower gross margin, which we have improved significantly and we'll continue to improve them. Well, I think, from head on, it's a slow and steady progress upwards. And I think we can get there, but we don't have a time frame.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: And then Steve, you talked a little bit about order visibility picking up close to 10. I'm just kind of curious, in this sort of environment, what you see around pricing trends for your products. Is that potential upside, or would you expect pricing to kind of fall in normal trends?
Steve Sanghi: Well, as far as the microcontrollers is concerned, which is bulk of our business, we don't joke around pricing. We don't take pricing down when there's excess availability or recession. We don't take pricing up when there's shortage. We don't gouge our customers, and we don't really give them big breaks. These are proprietary sockets where the prices determine that the part of designing and it's a very disciplined business. For 20 years, we have followed that strategy, and that's why we have so many repeat customers, loyal customers that continue to buy from us. So from our existing customers, we will not take advantage of them to increase the price. Now when the new customers come in, who have not been our customers and they are substituting the product, then you have to forget what the market is and what you should charge them. And again, an assessment of that point in time, whether they are just opportunistic for the quarter or we could make them long-term customers. If you can make them long-term customers, then they should have a fair price.
Operator: And we'll go next to Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates.
Gilbert Alexandre: As you look at fiscal 2012, you have -- are you willing to give a range of how much revenues could be up?
Steve Sanghi: No, Gil, we are not willing to give you a range. We gave a range for calendar '10 and fiscal '11, if you recall, that didn't do us any good. It didn't make us any friends and we blew those numbers away. When we gave a range, everybody said the numbers were not doable, and we blew those targets away and they're substantially better. So we missed our own number because we did much better. And do we have an internal plan? Sure, we do.
Gilbert Alexandre: I know that.
Steve Sanghi: Are we going to share it? No.
Gilbert Alexandre: Okay. And the second question, I'm assuming you can continue to gain market shares in the 3 categories?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. We fully expect to continue to gain market share in 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and Analog. And we did gain market share in all those product lines individually, as well as collectively in fiscal year '10, fiscal year '11.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Steve, I dropped off briefly so I apologize if you answered this earlier. But last year, I know obviously since you're growing at the rate of twice the microcontroller business. Looking forward, should we expect this growth rate to be the way we should think about Analog, and especially as you have go through business independence Analog business growing. So any way we should think about in terms of growth prospect forward for that business?
Steve Sanghi: Well, microcontroller is over a $1 billion business, and Analog was I don't know what it was for the year, $180 million or so. So the sizes are quite different, so that's one. If you compare Analog to some of the smaller segments of the Microcontroller business, like 16-bit or 32-bit or even the high-end Analog then they grew very significantly similarly. So when you combine the entire microcontrollers, then you add a very large amount of legacy business to it, and obviously, $1 billion business then is harder to compare against generating $80 million growth business. Secondly, as we are growing significantly on 16-bit and 32-bit, our 16-bit doubled the last year, and 32-bit more than tripled the last year. They have significant more Analog around the microcontrollers in those applications than the 8-bit did. So our opportunity on the new designs is significantly higher. And with our broad Analog portfolio, we're taking advantage of it.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: And just one more question. Your 32-bit has been growing significantly faster like you said than 16-bit was at some point. On one hand, should we see this as an indication of your going with MIPS as opposed to ARM. And also on the other hand, any comment as to what kind of end market is driving those 32-bit growth, that will just be helpful to look at how much more run rate there is for growth there.
Steve Sanghi: Okay. The end market, we don't have any commentary, as Ganesh said we're going to have over 600 customers and pretty much covers every end market. The ARM versus MIPS -- customers going by ARM or customers going by MIPS or by microcontrollers. And if you look at the EE Times survey that just came out 2 weeks ago, our PIC32 solution outranked every single microcontroller manufacturer in the 32-bit category in microcontroller applications, which are 100 megahertz or lower. Every single supplier of microcontroller that uses ARM or anybody else. And that's the right competition. We compete against manufacturers of 32-bit microcontrollers. We don't compete against ARM. And against that competition, we beat everyone of them, every single competitor was below us, in customers telling what are they likely to use for the next design. You should see that slide, we'll be showing it next time, anybody goes in the conference, that will be in our presentation, that slide. So it's impressive.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ruben Roy with Pacific Crest Securities.
Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: Either Steve or Ganesh, just a follow-up to the 32-bit discussion. You obviously have many more 16-bit customers. What's the overlap, 16-bit customers versus the kind of under 600 32-bit customers. Is there a lot of overlap, and is there any evidence as 32-bit accelerates that you're seeing some potential 16-bit sockets just straight away and move to 30-bit -- 32-bit?
Ganesh Moorthy: Clearly, there is some overlap in the customers, but not in necessarily in the given opportunity. I think the way to think about it is as we have brought more 32-bit solutions to the market, it actually opens up more 16-bit possibilities at a given customer because in some cases, where we came to a new customer who didn't buy anything from us starts up on a 32-bit, has another project that they work on and they say having tried of 32-bit, a 16-bit may be the right solution for the next one. So in the end, we want to sell customers 8s, 16s or 32s, whatever is right for their solution. But I don't think any 16-bit opportunity is being lost with 32-bit or vice versa. There are different needs, we find the right solution for a given need, and you position the product that best solves what the customer is trying to do.
Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: And can I ask, could you break out the 8-bit growth for fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010?
Ganesh Moorthy: I don't have the fiscal 2010 growth.
Steve Sanghi: We don't break the 8-bit growth, no we don't.
Ganesh Moorthy: 8-bit we don't. We have overall microcontroller growth.
Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: Right. Okay.
Steve Sanghi: We did say that we did record in 8-bit. Fiscal 2011 was a record 8-bit microcontroller revenue.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Doug Freedman with Gleacher.
Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Steve, if you could -- we saw a pretty big acquisition this quarter in a 10 gentle market, that being a national semi TI. Can you comment on how you see you're position in the market in any way affected by this and whether you think larger M&A needs to be a part of your ongoing strategy?
Steve Sanghi: Well, one of the questions I often get is like with such strength and really having a multibillion dollar Analog business that the acquiree is going to really have. What's going to happen to all the smaller guys? Is there room for Analog, or does everybody get squeezed out? My feeling is that, that not really happen. If that was to be the case, then, Microchip will have never made its mark in the Microcontroller business and even in the last 10 years building $180 million Analog business, lots and lots and lots of competitors were there. So in the semiconductor industry, it has never squeezed the little guy there are always opportunities where we have a differentiated product, we do a better job, we bundle it with a micro and other -- so we only expect our Analog opportunities to increase because it replaces where a customer still wants 2 sources and they were buying from 2 of them and things like that. And in any consolidation of such large businesses you're going to find places where the acquire screws up and we have acquired complete [ph] ourselves and 100% of things don't go right. So we're looking for this to be opportunity for us than a problem.
Operator: We have time for a final question tonight. It does come from Sujeeva De Silva with ThinkEquity.
Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC: I'm just trying to understand how a typical April, May, June quarter move in terms of linearity. And given the strong April this time around, whether you've guided to that typical linearity or more of a front end loaded quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Well, April, May, June is probably the most linear quarter. March quarter gets screwed up because of the Lunar New year. Summer quarter gets screwed up because of holidays in August in Europe and in October, November, December quarter has so many holidays in November and December. So this is probably the most normal quarter. But a phenomenal quarter every year also, so the data we gave you that the bookings were all time record for first month, that's a fact.
Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC: I guess my question is given the strong April, did you take a conservative stand, maybe assume less than typical linearity this time around or did you guide -- that typical in the area of a strong April that was my question?
J. Bjornholt: The strength Steve talked about was in bookings.
Steve Sanghi: Yes, the strength was in bookings.
Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC: [indiscernible] So you can deliver that.
Steve Sanghi: Yes it can aid out. So you really have to look at bottoms up how many customers want the product delivered and scheduled in the current quarter, from the bookings, from existing backlog and from the expectation of what the customers have told us what they may be buying, plus you have to estimate that this sales out [ph]. So it's really a fairly complicated equation.
Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC: Okay. That helps. And then if you could just remind us on back end. If you do outsource or whether it's all in-house and if you had to secure additional capacity given the events?
J. Bjornholt: We have on the order of 65% or so of our assembly, we do in-house, the bounce of it gets done through the subcontractors and a much higher percentage of our test is also been in-house. We have no issues at this point with respect to back end capacity and the addition of MMT further secures our back end capacity for the coming months.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. So Mr. Sanghi, I'll turn the call back to you for any closing comments.
Steve Sanghi: Okay. Thanks to all the investors and analysts. There are a few conferences coming up this quarter. So some of our executives will be seeing you at those conferences and otherwise, we'll see you in this call next quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to this Microchip Technology Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's CFO, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
J. Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events for the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations.  In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip’s COO; and Gordon Parnell, Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. I will comment on our third quarter of fiscal year 2011 financial performance and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.  We are including information in our press release on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.  I will now go through some of the operating results for the December quarter. Referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses. Net sales on the December quarter were towards the high end of our guidance at $367.8 million and were down sequentially 3.8% from net sales of $382.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter and were up 47.1% from net sales of $250.1 million in the December 2009 quarter. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.8% in the December quarter, well above the high end of our guidance and down marginally as compared to the 60.2% we achieved in the September quarter.  Non-GAAP operating expenses were 24.1% of sales and non-GAAP operating income was 35.6% of sales. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $113.8 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, which is also at the high end of our guidance. I want to point out to investors and analysts that fluctuations in Microchip's share price impacted diluted shares outstanding used in our earnings per share calculation. The average share price of Microchip's stock in the December quarter was significantly higher than the average share price in the September quarter. This resulted in a higher share count in part because incremental shares are included in the EPS denominator from Microchip's outstanding convertible debentures. Dilution from the convertible occurs at average quarterly share prices above $29.04, which is the current conversion price. The average price of Microchip's common stock in the December quarter was $33.21, and the stock is trading at higher levels in that today. We have posted a schedule that shows what the incremental share count from the convertible debt will be at various share prices in the supplemental financial information section of our website on the Investor Relations page. This will be helpful to investors and analysts in the future when trying to estimate the share count to use when modeling Microchip's earnings per share. The increase in the share count used in the earnings per share calculation from the September to the December quarter negatively impacted Microchip's earnings per share by about $0.013 on a non-GAAP basis. Using a hypothetical average share price in the March quarter of $38 to calculate the additional diluted effect from the convertible debt impacts Microchip's diluted earnings per share by about an additional $0.015 when compared to the dilutive effect from the convertible in the December quarter. Investors and analysts should refer to the table on our website if they want to model the diluted shares outstanding using a different average share price for the March quarter.  On a full GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, which includes the sell-through of written up inventory and intangible amortization were 58.8%. Total operating expenses were $98.9 million or 26.9% of sales and includes share-based compensation of $7.7 million, acquisition-related expenses of $1.9 million and $0.6 million in severance charges that are classified as a special charge within operating expenses.  GAAP net income from continuing operations was $101.9 million or $0.52 per diluted share. There was a net loss from discontinued operations of $1.2 million in the December quarter. In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 12.4% and the GAAP tax rate was 10.9%. The tax rate was impacted by the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, which favorably impacted the GAAP tax rate by $1.5 million for credits generated in the quarters prior to December 2010. The ongoing effects of the reinstated R&D tax credit were factored into our December 2010 tax rate and our forecast for the remainder of fiscal 2011. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and the percentage of our cash that have been invested in tax-advantaged securities. We expect our combined forward-looking effect of tax rate to be about 12% to 12.5%.  To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the December quarter, share-based compensation was about $0.042, acquisition-related items were about $0.021, non-cash interest expense was about $0.006 and the benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit was about $0.008. Microchip paid two dividends in the December quarter. The first dividend was our normal dividend payment and that was $0.344 per share. The second dividend, which was paid on December 27, was an acceleration of the March 2011 dividend due to the uncertainty around potential tax law changes beyond 2010 at the time of the dividend declaration. Microchip's next dividend will be announced with our March 2011 quarterly result and paid in June 2011.  Moving on to the balance sheet, Microchip's inventory at December 31, 2010, was $177.7 million or 107 days, up 10 days from the prior-quarter levels. We have stated that our internal target for inventory days was about 115 and we expect to continue to build our inventory levels in the March quarter to help us achieve this target, improve lead times and support our customers delivery the requirements. This has been a successful competitive advantage for Microchip over many cycles and we expect similar positive results from our customers in the market. Inventory at our distributors was 39 days, which is up three days from the prior-quarter level. At December 31, Microchip's accounts receivable balance was $187.3 million, a decrease of 7.6% from the balance as of the end of September. Receivable balances are in great condition with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. As of December 31, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1.57 billion and was up $4.1 million from the prior-quarter levels even with Microchip paying $129.4 million in dividends during the quarter. Our cash generation continues to be strong and our total cash and investment position is projected to grow by approximately $125 million to $135 million in the March quarter.  Capital spending was approximately $34.2 million for the December quarter. We are continuing to invest in equipment to support the revenue growth of our new products and technologies, and our capital expenditure forecast for fiscal 2011 is about $130 million. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $23.6 million, which was down from depreciation of $23.7 million in the September quarter.  I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric. And good afternoon, everyone. Let's now take a closer look at the performance of our individual product lines starting with microcontrollers.  Our Microcontroller business performed better than we expected with revenue only down 2.2% on a sequential basis, but were up 24% from the year-ago quarter. We shipped our 9 billionth cumulative microcontroller in December and finished calendar year 2010 shipping a record 1.3 billion microcontrollers. For calendar year 2010, our overall Microcontroller business was up 42.4% over calendar year 2009. Our 8-bit Microcontroller business performed better than we expected with a minimal sequential decline and up significantly from the year-ago quarter. Our 16-bit Microcontroller business was down 2.6% sequentially, but was up 84% from the year-ago quarter. For calendar year 2010, our 16-bit Microcontroller business was up 113.6%, more than doubling over the calendar year 2009 revenue. New customers and new designs continue to go into production as a number of volume 16-bit customers grew to over 3,300 customers. Our 32-bit microcontroller product line, which took a pause in the September quarter, had another strong quarter of growth in the December quarter, up 45% on a sequential basis, achieving a new record just as we had forecast it. For calendar year 2010, our 32-bit Microcontroller business was up 260%, more than tripling over the calendar year 2009 revenue. The number of customers in volume production grew by over 25% to 524 as we continue to build a broad base of customers to grow our 32-bit business.  Moving to Development Tools. We shipped over 40,000 development tools in the December quarter. Our Development Tools sale has remained an excellent leading indicator of continued strong design and activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers and the continued trend of strong Development Tools sales bodes well for our future growth. Now moving to our Analog products. Our Analog business was down 4.7% sequentially, but was up 67% from the year-ago quarter. For calendar year 2010, our Analog business was up 93.4%, almost double the calendar year 2009 revenue. We are very pleased with the design win and revenue momentum of our Analog business and we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new products, which we expect will continue to contribute to strong revenue growth in the coming quarters. Now moving to the Memory business. This business is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash memory products. And together, they were down 13.5% on a sequential basis. We continue to run our Memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions.  With that, let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh. And good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the performance of our SST business units in the most recent quarter, then I will reflect on the overall December quarter results. And finally, I will talk about our guidance for the March 2011 quarter. So let's begin with some comments on the SST division. Our licensing revenue was up 10.3% sequentially and reached another all-time record of $19.1 million in the December quarter. When we acquired SST, some investors and analysts had shown concern regarding how the licensing business will perform under Microchip. Their obvious concern was that a significant portion of the licensing business was with Microchip's competitors in the Microcontroller business. After acquiring SST, we created a firewall around the licensing business and decided to manage it at an arm's length to our Microcontroller division. We still have access to advanced SuperFlash technology for our microcontrollers, but the competitor's information is not accessible by our Microcontroller division. This has relieved any concerns and our licensing business has continued to flourish. The real proof of sustainable growth of our licensing business is not just in the existing business, the real proof is in the new licenses signed. Last quarter, we signed six new licensing agreements. Three of these agreements were in Europe, one in China, one in Japan and one elsewhere in Asia. Three of the agreements were with IBM, two were with silicon foundries and one was with a design services company. Three of these deals were incremental licensees with companies that we already do business with. The three other deals where with brand-new companies that we have never done licensing business with. As of the start of the January 2011, there were several additional new deals in the funnel since January 1. One of these deals have already been signed. Proper restructuring of the licensing division under Microchip with focused resources, as well as freedom to pursue more creative business models has allowed acceleration of prospecting and deal closure. Therefore, it is quite clear that we are succeeding in this licensing business across a very broad front around the globe and with IBM and foundries alike. The central attraction continues to be the SuperFlash technology, which is the premier flash technology available for embedded control. There are two kinds of companies in the embedded control, the ones that are using SuperFlash technology and the ones who should be using it. Our SuperFlash technology has penetrated about 25% of the total available market and there's much more room to grow. Now during the last quarter, we also announced that Microchip had decided to retain the SuperFlash memory in RF divisions of SST. In the December quarter, we continue to make outstanding progress in improving the operating model for the SuperFlash memory division in the RF divisions through hard work in partnering with customers, targeting markets, focusing on pricing, improving manufacturing costs and incorporating these divisions into the Microchip business structure. The gross margin improvements have been excellent and we fully expect these divisions to continue to drive Microchip's overall gross margin to higher level. You can see that we have had a laser focus on improving these divisions' gross margins, just like we have done with all of Microchip's product lines throughout Microchip's history. We decided to retain these product lines as ongoing businesses of Microchip as we more fully understood the opportunities that presented and the improvements that we could achieve. We believe that significant margin improvements are still ahead of us. SST divisions were accretive to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings by about $0.09 per share for the December quarter. We expect SST to add approximately $0.32 to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings for fiscal year '11. And for fiscal year '12, we expect the SST businesses to add about $0.40 to our earnings per share. As I reflect on the overall December quarter, it was an excellent quarter for Microchip. Our sales were better than the middle point of our guidance. We beat the overall gross margin target by 60 basis points. We beat the non-GAAP EPS target by $0.01, despite an additional $0.013 per share impact due to the higher share count. Our core Microcontroller business was down only 2.2% sequentially and our 32-bit Microcontroller business achieved another record with a gain of 45.5% sequentially. Our 32-bit Microcontroller is almost exactly following the performance of our 16-bit Microcontroller business with now 10 quarters since the introduction. We continue to be pleased with the penetration we're making in both our 16-bit as well as 32-bit Microcontroller businesses. The December quarter also marked our 81st consecutive profitable quarter, and it's a testimony to the resiliency of the business model that we have fine-tuned over time.  Now looking back on calendar year 2010. We had one of our best-growth years ever with over 64% growth as compared to calendar year 2009. If you recall a year ago, we guided to 26% revenue growth from calendar year '09 to calendar year '10. We also guided to a non-GAAP EPS of $1.50 for calendar year '10. At that time, our yearly guidance was seem overly optimistic. I apologize for not guiding more precisely and for beating the numbers by achieving 64% revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS of $2.26. Even if you take the EPS accretion delivered by SST divisions out of the numbers, we still achieved a non-GAAP EPS of $2.02 versus our forecast of $1.50 enough said. As we enter calendar year 2011, we believe we are exceptionally well positioned for continued growth in all of our strategic businesses. I will now provide guidance for March 2011 quarter. We saw a mild inventory correction in the December quarter. As we said in our last earnings conference call, we expected this correction to be mild and be completed after one quarter. With improving lead times in our business, our longer-term backlog visibility is decreasing since customers are no longer placing orders many months out. Therefore, book-to-bill ratio is less than one with the December quarter at 0.77. However, as you have seen before, book-to-bill ratio has no correlation to the quarterly performance. 1.41 book-to-bill ratio in June quarter last year was as meaningless as 0.77 book-to-bill ratio for the last quarter. The backlog shippable in the March quarter is very healthy. We will also see some seasonal impact of Lunar New Year in Asia considering all that we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be flat to up 3% sequentially. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be 60% plus, minus 0.1% for March quarter and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.56 and $0.58. Earnings per share assumes an average Microchip stock price of $38 in the quarter, which adds 6.1 million shares to our share count from the December quarter. The total net earnings in dollars at the midpoint of the guidance are expected to be up by about $1.2 million or $0.006 at constant share count. Given all the complications of accounting, for a large acquisition including purcahse inventory write-up, amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and sale of non-core businesses, like many other companies have done, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results will provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.  With that, operator, would you please pool for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: I just wonder if you could give a little more color around how you got to the guidance levels that you put out for the March quarter? Perhaps, give us some indication for what you've been seeing with regard to turns business and what you're expecting with regard to turns for the March quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Well, again, the question circles around sort of a book-to-bill ratio in terms and all that. And if you go back last year when the lead times were longer and are current lead times are, by the way, four to six weeks on majority of our products. So when the lead times were longer, you're not only getting the backlog for the current quarter, you're getting backlog for almost the entire next quarter because if the lead times are much longer, people have to put their orders and get the space in line. As the lead times have come in, the entire impact that we have seen is we're no longer getting orders for four months, five months, six months out. But the current backlog is very healthy compared to the prior quarter. And we're getting the appropriate amount of turns needed, which are quite strong. Turns are quite strong because parts availability is there and people need the parts and they didn't need to place the orders ahead of time. So when you kind of look at all that, the quarter seems quite normal.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: In other words, it sounds like it's really a question of the longer lead orders are coming off, but the orders within the next sort of 90 days or so seem to be maintaining at a reasonable pace?
Steve Sanghi: Exactly.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chris Danely from JPMorgan.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Actually, Steve, just a quick clarification. So are you saying that your 32-bit Microcontroller revenue has been tracking the 16-bit Microcontroller revenue for the same time period and could you please repeat that time period?
Steve Sanghi: So 32-bit microcontrollers were introduced 10 quarters ago, 2 1/2 years. So if I start from the first quarter of 16-bit and line it up against the first quarter of 32-bit, after 10 quarters, 32-bit is running exactly where 16-bit did.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And as my follow-up, so it sounds like you guys can continue to improve the gross margin. Can you just give us a sense of what the drivers would be after this quarter and then maybe throw in a little bit of color on the OpEx drivers after this quarter too?
Steve Sanghi: Gross margin is within a smaller distance of a really longer-term guidance of 61%, plus, minus -- 61% to 62%, so it's not like it's a huge distance away, it's 150 basis points or so away. So there are lots of small, small drivers, but really no single driver. Obviously, we are ramping up facilities to provide for growth. After the current quarter, we have two very strong back-to-back quarters coming up, June and September, which are seasonally very strong quarters for Microchip and we expect them again this year. So currently, we are ramping all of our facilities, both the assembly and test. We are continuing to improve the gross margin of SuperFlash memory division, which has improved dramatically. Quite dramatically, we don't break it out. But quite dramatically, since we bought it and it was up again last quarter and will be up again this quarter. The licensing business is doing very well, which is overall accretive to gross margin. And just lots of normal things, the depreciation rolling off, higher absorption, some strengths[ph] , price management and all these other functions that are incrementally accreting to gross margin every quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I was wondering if you could speak to linearity in the quarter and it seems like relative to your original guidance and your guidance update, it seems to be pretty much right in line. But if you have any commentary on how it went from October through December that'd be helpful.
Ganesh Moorthy: I don't think there was anything abnormal as we've gone through the quarter. And I think a normal December quarter has a slower finish, as we go into December has the strongest start comparatively in October and it performed exactly to that.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then relative to your OpEx levels, I think going back to the history, you've done a very good job of maintaining the OpEx at a low percentage of sales, and I think were towards the low end of your so-called range by quite a bit. Can you talk about, as we move through this calendar year, whether you expect that ratio to increase at all given what you expect in terms of the overall revenue run rate, or you think you'll be able to maintain this level here?
Steve Sanghi: Our longer-term guidance still have been about 25% to 26% -- 24% to 26%. So, kind of wider gap. The reason that the expenses are on the lower end of the target is because of just the dramatic growth, achieving 64% growth in the year. You couldn’t add expenses if you wanted to. So we are well funded, all the divisions, all the product lines are really very well staffed. And we're adding people rapidly to further invest into strategic product lines. So as growth happens and as these additional people come on board, I think it will kind of track. But overall, we're in the low end of the overall percentage of revenue and expenses. And over time, it will migrate towards the middle. And I don't know the timeframe because that largely will depend on the growth.
Operator: We'll go next to Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup Inc: I think the fiscal '11 CapEx is $130 million. I was wondering if you could perhaps comment on your expectations and your needs for fiscal '12 CapEx. And also just briefly comment on whether some of the depreciation treatment, accounting wise, is influencing any of your purchasing decisions in calendar '11.
Steve Sanghi: Well, we don't have a fiscal year '12 capital number for you today. We are putting together fiscal year '12 plan internally in the company as we speak. We have a full calendar that's starting with the product lines and revenue assumptions and then going through the capacity and the capital needed to provide that and then the expenses and all that. So we don't have the fiscal year '12, fiscal year comments for you today. In terms of purchasing and depreciation that will impact our decisions.
J. Bjornholt: There's nothing on the accounting side that's going to change how we think about investing, Terence. We're going to continue to invest as we see appropriate in business.
Steve Sanghi: Well, the changes there, it's all written up in the one year.
J. Bjornholt: Yes, the acceleration of depreciation..
Steve Sanghi: So this is for the tax purpose, it's not for the GAAP.
J. Bjornholt: And that's not going to drive...
Steve Sanghi: And that's not going to drive any decisions for us.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup Inc: Then, perhaps as my follow-up, you alluded to a very successful quarter for the licensing business. Steve, you mentioned that the several new customers, as well as several new contracts with the existing customers in the licensing business. Can you talk a little bit about the outlook for that business over the next several years? Are there any patent quests that could affect the revenue rate of that business? Is that can be a strategic area of growth for you? If you can just comment how you're thinking about that over the longer term?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, it's absolutely a strategic area of growth. The licensing stream varies over a period of time. So when you sign a license, it usually means nothing immediately. We usually have some payments that come to us over step payments as the technology is implemented, then as the customer's revenue ramp and there's royalty stream. So it's kind of like builds up over some time one, two, three, four years and several of these licenses are going really all together in parallel. So over time, the business grows. We currently don't see, really, any issues in being able to continue to grow the business. The licensing business did record in September quarter, did record again in December quarter and we're fairly confident that it will do record again in the current March quarter.
Operator: We'll go next to Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.
Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital: Steve, you are referencing that you feel that you're likely to return to some strong growth in the June and September periods. I was wondering if you could give some feel for what areas you are looking forward to seeing stronger growth from as you move through the year? And what some of the factors are in just sounding that you feel reasonably confident about the outlook for June and September?
Ganesh Moorthy: You've seen some of the momentum that our product lines have been building. In addition to a core 8-bit business that has been growing, we have a much faster growing 16-, 32-bit and Analog product lines. And we've seen the design momentum that we have on those products. As we go into our seasonally strong June and September quarters, we expect will contribute strong growth. We're not really market-segment centric many of these things. We have designs that are in many, many different applications in markets. We don't rely on any one market or any one application to drive the growth.
Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital: You mentioned, if I may, the usual Lunar New Year impact. When do you sort of feel that? And what is the linearity associated with that? Does it mean that orders sort of slow at the beginning of February or has it -- what is your expectation there?
Steve Sanghi: We are in the Lunar New Year right now as we speak. And the people return to work, I think, around the 8th of February. So usually when the Lunar New Year falls early, like it is falling this year, it's actually very good because people come back after that, and you still have the rest of the quarter left with strong orders and filling the pipeline and all that. Sometimes Lunar New Year falls very late. It has fallen as late as early March, or even late February, and when that happens, it gets a little more tricky. And you have to get all the orders before people leave for the Lunar New Year, and because you don't have enough time to build it in the right mix after that. So this time, the Lunar New Year is early. So I think it should really work out very good.
Operator: We'll go next to Sumit Dhanda with Citadel Securities.
Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC: Steve, your commentary on the turns bookings being relatively strong, I guess the question was in terms of your outlook for the March quarter, is the expectation that you have enough backlog and that's the primary reason that you're should be able to shift to that revenue outlook despite the low book-to-bill? Or is the jump in turns bookings the primary driver of the seasonal or the positive outlook?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the book-to-bill ratio we report is the bookings we get in the quarter for shipment over the following one year divided by the billings or the revenue in the current quarter. So I don't know how everybody else does it, but I think it's reasonably standard that you take all the bookings you get in the quarter, which are shippable sometime over the next year and divid it by the billings of the current quarter. So when the lead times are long, you're getting large amount of bookings for the second and third quarter out in time and you're dividing it by the current quarter's revenue. So book-to-bill ratio is unreasonably large like it was 1.41 and 1.36. Now in that kind of environment, your backlog is filled up for the current quarter because you don't have enough lead time to ship it to the current quarter. So most of the bookings are getting out there in time. Now when the business environment transitions and you have much shorter lead time, then all the outer bookings dry up because people have plenty of time to place those orders. So you're not getting all those outer bookings. And if the current quarter backlog is quite healthy, which it is in the transition because you're coming from a fairly strong backlog, then you're dividing small number of bookings largely from the current quarter divided by the full revenue. And then the equation reverses, you have a very low book-to-bill ratio.
Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC: So maybe, I don't know if you have this information handy, is there a sort of -- to make an apples-to-apples comparison, is there a 90-day book-to-bill, so to speak, that you could share with us or not really?
Ganesh Moorthy: We don't track it that way. I think maybe to answer your question, we have strong backlog for this quarter. We see the turns coming in at the rate that we need to hit the guidance we have given you, and that's why we have the guidance we have.
Sumit Dhanda - Citadel Securities, LLC: One quick follow-up for you, Eric. You said distribution days were up three to 39, but my recollection was it was 34 last quarter. So maybe I misheard the 39 as the 37.
J. Bjornholt: 39 is the correct number.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: On the 32-bit rebound that you saw in the December quarter, can you give us more details on what that was if it's certain markets or was it just the product coming through pipeline?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's a result of an accumulation of designs that we have been harvesting for some time. When we reported for the September quarter, I said, "Hey, we have, in a smaller business, more lumpy revenue that comes along." We have no concerns at all about what happened in the September quarter. And we as we expected, the designs continue to grow the customers who may have taken a pause in September came back in for growth in December. And overall, it's growing across -- we have over 500 customers now involved in production on the 32-bit. So it is growing across a broadening base of customers, which in time will make it a more predictable business in terms of quarter-over-quarter sequential growth.
Steve Sanghi: The backlog on 16 and 32-bit looks very healthy so we should have a outstanding quarter again in March.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just in general, are you seeing any pressure on cost of your materials going up? Any issues there?
Steve Sanghi: Well, it's a semiconductor industry. There are constant challenges. In the last year, we have absorbed the price of gold, copper and all the materials going up, fuel charges, energy costs, gas and other. While at the same time, you have yield improvements, you have absorption, you have depreciation falling off, you have value added in new products, and for certain features, and others you can manage ASP in. That's basically the semiconductor business. And all those things average out, but would we like lower gold price, would we like lower material prices? Yes, but those are not the things we can control. So we a have very, very strong cost reduction effort, which keeps up with these things and still produce a gross margin.
Operator: We'll go next to John Barton with Cowen.
John Barton - Cowen and Company, LLC: ; Steve, if you could update us on what you're seeing from the touch sensor market strategy going forward for that market, please?
Ganesh Moorthy: So there are -- the touch sensors market has a broad set of applications where that feature is required. Where Microchip has chosen to focus is in all of the broad kinds of applications that are not in cellphones and not in tablets. So in embedded markets, across the types of markets where our microcontrollers get used, touch sensors are being added. And in many of those applications, we have the exact solution that they need, and we are growing much faster than anybody else in those applications. However, we don't believe that the long-term characteristics in the cellphone business is necessarily one that creates a sustainable and predictable business result. And so we have chosen not to be in those areas, but we're doing very well in all the other applications that we touch.
John Barton - Cowen and Company, LLC: Steve, you've expressed in your prepared statements, some disappointment that you did not accurately forecast 2010. So using what you've learned from that pleasant mistake, what are your thoughts in 2011?
Steve Sanghi: What I've learned is that whatever I say, it's not going to be believed. So I decided not to say anything.
John Barton - Cowen and Company, LLC: If I promise to believe, will you say something?
Steve Sanghi: You may promise to believe, but there's just constant reports, which tell us that we're going to underperform. And we have constantly beaten those expectations. So there's really no point in continuously belaboring 2012 forecast. We'll just deliver the results.
Operator: We'll go next to Mark Lipacis with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley: If you normalize for the double dividend payment this quarter, it looks like your dividend payout over the last couple of quarter was about as low as it's been in at least two years or so. And I was wondering if you're embarking on a strategy or conscious decision to try to build cash, and if so, what would be the use for that cash?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think if you go back in history, we always said that we were going to rapidly grow the dividend, Get to a very healthy level. And then from there, just grow it on a very, very slow basis. Not double, triple it quickly, but grow it rapidly, which we did in the earlier years. And then just slightly continue to grow, which we are doing right now by $0.001 a share every quarter. Now as far as the use of cash is concerned, there are the normal use of cash. There are -- there's dividend, there's acquisitions and they're a normal use in our business. As I earlier said, our business is very well funded, and we are generating huge cash from operations every quarter. So investment in our business is not using up cash, actually, it's generating additional cash; which leaves a build up of the cash, slow dividend increase and essentially opportunistic acquisitions like the great acquisition we did with SST. Meanwhile, the cash will continue to grow. Going significantly past the current dividend level doesn't buy a whole lot. Our dividend is the highest in the semiconductor industry. I believe there's only one company, TSMC, which is not quite an IDM, which may have a higher percentage dividend. I haven't compared recently, but I think they were. But compared to anybody else, we have the highest dividend. So just continue to grow that, we don't believe is right thing to do.
John Barton - Cowen and Company, LLC: When you look at the growth in your 16- and 32-bit business, doubling and more than tripling, is there a particular vertical market that is driving the growth where you're seeing the particular demand for the products?
Ganesh Moorthy: There are no particular vertical markets that we either focus on or that are necessarily driving that growth. It's a pretty broad-based growth. If you look at customers wise, there's over 500 customers on the 32-bit. There's over 3,300 on the 16-bit. And these are volume customers. And typically, when you have volume customers at a certain level, there's about 2x to 3x that many that are customers in the incubation stage of developing new designs. So when you have such a broad suite of customers, there's no single application or market that drives the growth. That's the way we like it, by the way.
John Barton - Cowen and Company, LLC: And so is it fair to say that 16, the vertical market profile of 16- and 32-bit is similar to 8-bit, is that fair?
J. Bjornholt: Very similar, there may be small percentage here and there that change. But in general, the profile is very similar.
Operator: And we'll go next with Steven Eliscu with UBS.
Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank: Just first wanted to ask on the touch control market, I know you've talked about not wanting to pursue the cellphone and tablet markets, but as they gain scale, that could give them an advantage in other markets such as industrial. What are you doing to potentially offset those advantages that they may have?
Ganesh Moorthy: We're not aware of any particular advantage that they have that is giving them scale. Obviously, there are markets that have certain characteristics that we like. Our products work extremely well in the markets that we are going after and for the applications that we're going after. There are no technical challenges that we're seeing. It's just work to go support a large group of customers and to build a productive business that we find sustainable and profitable.
Steve Sanghi: This is not any different than historical use of microcontrollers in the cellphone where we did not focus on versus everywhere else. And you could have asked that question 10 years ago, that you're not in cellphones with all that higher volume, our competitors and others who were largely dominated the cellphone will get an advantage or whatever than they would really have it in any other market. It really hasn't changed that way. These cellphones are unpredictable, short life cycle, lower gross margin, and always, always get packaged into ASIC. The first couple of models is not, but maybe the second design, ASIC will take that it in, and it will not be in micro. Versus the places where we are in. Industrial, automotive, consumer, we probably have over 500 customers in production today in all sorts of applications. The margins are significantly higher, the design -- the lifetime of the design is much longer. They're not ready to get packaged and the next designed into an ASIC. So there are all these advantages that we like. But to do a given volume, we have to serve 10x, 15x, 20x more customers. It's like getting $20 million business at one customer versus getting $20 million business at 100 customers. We excel at serving 100 customers. That's where we make the margin. That's our business model, always has been.
Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank: I guess the angle I was looking at was in terms of your large screen resistive and your inductive technologies, how those are potentially augmenting the capacitive touch technology, touch controllers that you're focused on for specific subsegments.
Steve Sanghi: But the majority of a large portion of our revenue today is in capacitive touch sense. We have it in resistive also, but we are very competitive technology on capacitive touch sense. And I think I said that before. I think that two of our competitors always win the cellphone and we win everything else, pretty much. It's easy to get numbers on tablets and numbers on cellphones and smartphones and screen touch and all that. That's very easy to analyze because you can get easily the numbers. If you don't get the numbers on touch sense, on everywhere else, on postage meters, and thermostats, and DVDs, and TVs and push-button, which have touch phones and all that. We've got all that. It's in production in high-volume and lots of lots of places. We're making huge revenue. But it's harder to analyze, harder to get numbers and we like that. That's why we're successful --
Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank: Let me switch gears and ask about 32-bit. Clearly, you're getting some nice growth. What are you doing in terms of your sales and applications force to get them oriented to the right customers? I understand the segments are similar to your 8- and 16-bit segments, but I would imagine that some of the customers are new customers with new requirements you may not have seen in the past. So how are you making sure that they can win more often than not?
J. Bjornholt: I think, we have -- for the longest time, new customers are an integral part of our sales process. So even when we had 8, there was an upper end of 8-bit that was new; when we had 16, when we had 32. So we're constantly going after new customers and learning in the process what we may not have that we need improve on. But the 32-bit in particular, if you remember from the days when we were just in 16-bit, we used to report that we played and we were winning against other 32-bit competitors. So we've been in the market and we've seen the customer requirements from the days when we were just with 16-bits only. We continue to evolve our tools, our software, our product capabilities, application notes, our technical support, the whole field sales force augmentation that we did. So for a number of years, things we did to retool our capability to be successful in 16-bit, are now paying off not just for 16-bit but also for 32-bit.
Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank: And one last quick question on just the board's thought on share repurchases. I realize you're opportunistic, but are you thinking that it's just a pullback continued increases and share counts assuming share count continues to rise? Or if you like to see the share count get back under 200?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think we fundamentally do not believe in the strategy of continuously buying shares at all levels. And just trying to dollar cost average into something like that. I've said that on this conference call before that I personally own stocks of lots of other technology companies that have bought billions and billions of dollars of stock, large technology companies over 10 years having no effect on the stock. So Microchip does stock buyback very opportunistically when we believe the stock is undervalued and the Street has thrown the baby out with the bathwater, which seem to happen more often than we would like. In 2008 in the middle of the crisis, the stock was $16 and people were calling it to $12. So that was the last time we bought stock. And you can see where the stock is today, and that was a great return in our investment.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Ian Ing with Gleacher & Co.
Ian Ing - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Your SST business, where are you with training your sales and FAE teams to better sell licensing in SuperFlash and uncover incremental opportunities? Is it something that you're starting to benefit from already or that lies ahead?
Steve Sanghi: The Microchip sales team does not sell licensing. There's a firewall around the licensing business. This doesn't need a broad distributor and channel sales force because we largely go sell it to the foundries, we sell it to the IDMs and design services companies. And these are not the kind of people our salespeople call on. Our sales people call on original equipment manufacturers, trying to sell our microcontrollers and Analog products. And our sales force should not be going and selling to our competitors, our technology. So the sales force for Licensing business is totally separate. It's firewall. It's not a very large sales force. It doesn't need a very large sales force because you're dealing with a handful of licensees at any one point in time. So it's strictly firewall. It's totally separate. And the rest of the SST business, the RF business, the SuperFlash Memory business is integrated. And our sales force is trained in selling those products today.
Ian Ing - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Last quarter, I think you had a series of international MASTERs conferences. Is there any read on broad-based economy, things like customer travel, registration, other activities?
Steve Sanghi: We had a record attendance in our MASTERs conferences; in Scottsdale, which was in August, in India, which was last year, in China. We also did one in Brazil. So the attendance is record attendance everywhere. And obviously, it's driven by good prospect, great products, lots of new products in 8, 16, 32, analogs. So people come to learn what they don't know, and we have a lot to offer, usually, that drives the attendance as much as the economy.
Operator: We'll go next to Ray Rund with Shaker Investments.
Raymond Rund - Shaker Investments: Steve, I was just curious, has your success with 16- and 32-bit necessitated any changes in your fab process technology thinking? Are you content to keep these types of products in the foundries or do you think at some point in the future, you may want to take them inside?
Steve Sanghi: We're not making them exclusively in the foundries nor are we making it exclusively inside. It's a hybrid today. It's product by product. And some products may have characteristics or memory size or performance requirement that we may not have inside and others we can do inside. So all of the 16 and 32 business is neither inside nor outside.
Operator: And we'll go next to Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.
Brett Piira - Caris & Company: This is Brett Piira for Craig. Could you give us any color on regional strengths and weaknesses in the quarter?
Steve Sanghi: The March quarter or December?
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company: The just reported December.
Steve Sanghi: So in December quarter, what was very strong was Europe. It's usually a seasonally very week quarter for Europe because of the holidays. Their Christmas holidays is longer than anywhere else in the world. But Europe had strong economy, driven by Germany and we did very, very well in Europe. Everywhere else was kind of normal. Europe was the exception.
Brett Piira - Caris & Company: Then maybe just broadly, you talked about gaining some share. How was your market share looking across the Microcontroller?
Steve Sanghi: So based on the numbers that we see, we believe last year we gained market share in 8, 16, 32 and Analog, in all of our strategic product lines. Our 8-bit microcontroller did all-time record sales in September quarter, was down very marginally in the last quarter, December quarter like the others were. And now when the numbers come out, 2010 numbers will confirm that, but the level of growth we had in 2010 was incredible on 8-bit.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A session. So I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Steve Sanghi.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you. So we'll see some of you at the Thomas Weisel Conference, which we're going to be presenting on the 10th of February, I believe. And so we'll see some of you on the road again in various non-deal roadshows we'll be conducting this quarter and next. So thank you very much. Bye bye.
Operator: This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2011 Q2  (2010-11-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Microchip Technology second quarter and fiscal year 2011 earnings results conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Microchip’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Please go ahead sir.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you operator and good afternoon everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip’s Chief Operating Officer, Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer and Gordon Parnell, Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. I will first comment on the status of the restructuring and integration of Silicon Storage Technology. All of our financial reserves flow from the understanding of how this acquisition is being accounted for. Eric Bjornholt will then give you the details of our financial performance. Ganesh will give his comments on the results of the product line, and then I will discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Microchip acquired Silicon Storage Technology, SST, on April 8, 2010. At that time we determined that we would hold SST’s super flash memory solid state drive, smart card and RF businesses as assets held for sale. On May 21, 2010 we consummated and announced a transaction in which we sold solid state drive, smart card and certain older flash memory product lines to Greenline Systems Inc. Then we announced a second transaction on July 8, 2010 in which we exclusively licensed certain flash memory products in certain geographic markets of Asia, mainly Taiwan and China to Professional Computer Technology, or PCT. After that, we still had remaining super flash memory business and RF business held for sale. After operating the SST business for two quarters, we have found synergy between SST’s RF business and Microchip’s wireless controller and analog business. On the memory side, after selling the low margin end of the business to PCT of Taiwan, we have substantially improved our gross margin for the rest of the super flash memory business. Additionally, we have found and running from volume on the memory business is critical to proving out the technology before it can be licensed. There are also significant operational synergies with Microchip’s memory business and technology synergies with Microchip’s micro controller business. As such, we have very substantially eliminated the excess overhead and dramatically reduced the operating expenses of the SST business. With that, we have decided to keep the super flash memory and RF businesses of SST as ongoing businesses of Microchip. In this press release and in future filings with the SEC, the first quarter of fiscal quarter of 2011 will be presented as if the SST super flash memory and RF divisions were always included in the continuing operations of Microchip. Microchip’s second quarter of fiscal 2011 guidance provided on August 5, 2010 did not include the super flash memory and RF divisions of SST. Without these divisions, Microchip guided its net sales to be $340 to $343 million for the September quarter, and compared to that, our actual results for these businesses achieved $343.3 million, which is near the high end of our previous guidance. The super flash memory and RF divisions of SST added approximately $40 million of revenue in the September 2010 quarter. The restructuring and integration of SST is now complete. We have transformed SST into a very profitable entity that is an accretive to Microchip’s non-GAAP earnings per share by about $0.08 for the September quarter. We expect SST to add approximately $0.32 to Microchip’s non-GAAP earnings for fiscal ‘11 compared to our original of EPS accretion for fiscal year ‘11 of only $0.14 to $0.18. For fiscal year ‘12, we expect the SST business to add about $0.40 to our earnings per share. We are very pleased to have completed this project and believe that we have delivered on our commitment of providing significant shareholder value through this acquisition. I will now pass this on to Eric Bjornholt who will cover the financials on a fully consolidated basis including all continuing operations of Microchip on the revised basis including the super flash memory and RF businesses of SST.
Eric Bjornholt: Thanks Steve, and good afternoon everyone. We are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on our investor relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will go through some of the operating results on a fully consolidated basis for the September quarter. Any comparisons I make to the June quarter will also be based on a fully consolidated basis, which is revised to include the RF and super flash memory businesses of SST. I will begin by referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of share based compensation and acquisition related expenses. Net sales in the September quarter were a record $382.3 million, and were up approximately 7% from net sales of $357.1 million in the immediately preceding quarter and were up 68.7% from net sales of $226.7 million in the September 2009 quarter. Non-GAAP gross margins were 60.2% in the September compared to 60.3% in the June quarter. Our factories produced record output during the quarter and our cost structures remained in excellent condition. With the increase in revenue in the September quarter, and our continued focus on prudent spending, operating expenses were 24% of sales compared to 24.5% in the June quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was 36.2% of sales. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $119.6 million or a record $0.63 per diluted share, an increase of 8.8% from non-GAAP net income of $109.9 million or $0.58 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins including share based compensation and acquisition related expenses which include the sell through our written up inventory and intangible amortization were 58.9%. Total operating expenses were $101.9 million or 26.6% of sales and include share based compensation of $7.2 million, acquisition related expenses of $2.2 million and $.6 million in severance and office closure charges that are classified as a special charge within operating expenses. GAAP net income from continuing operations was $104.8 million or $0.55 per diluted share, an increase of 14% from GAAP net income of $91.9 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter. In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 13.2% and the GAAP tax rate was 13.4%. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and a percentage of our cash that is invested in tax advantage securities. We expect our combined forward-looking effective tax rate to be about 13%. To summarize the after tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip’s earnings per share in the September quarter, share based compensation was about $0.041 cents, acquisition related were about $0.031 and non-cash interest expense was about $0.06. As indicated in our press release today, Microchip will be paying two dividends in the December quarter. The first dividend of $0.344 per share will be paid on December 2, 2010 to shareholders of record on November 18, 2010. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $64.1 million. The second dividend is an acceleration of the March 2011 dividend into December 2010 to allow our shareholders to take advantage of the lower tax rate that will apply in 2010 compared to what is expected for 2011. This dividend is $0.345 per share and will be paid on December 27, 2010 to shareholders of record on December 13, 2010. The cash payment associated with this dividend is expected to be $64.3 million. Moving on to the balance sheet, keeping the super flash memory and RF business of SST, increased the dollar amount of Microchip’s inventory in support of these businesses as we closed the September quarter with $166.6 million of inventory, representing approximately 97 days, which is down one day from the prior quarter levels. Inventory at our distributors was 34 days, which is up one day from the prior quarter level. At the end of September the combined inventory on Microchip’s balance sheet and at its distributors was 131 days or flat to the prior quarter. I want to point out that the deferred income on shipment to distributors increased 22.4% sequentially, but this was impacted by the inclusion of the super flash memory and RF divisions of SST and the conversion of certain SST stocking reps into sell through distributors during the September quarter. I would like to remind you that Microchip recognizes its distribution revenue on a sell through basis in its worldwide distribution channel. During the September quarter, we continue to increase our manufacturing output to allow us to satisfy the needs of our customers. We forecast inventory days on our balance sheet to increase in the December quarter, but the amount of the increase will be dependent on the levels of inventory our distributors decide to hold for their customers, overall demand for our products and production levels. Inventory on Microchip’s balance sheet has been too low for the past several quarters and building some inventory this quarter, will help bring our lead times closer to the levels our customers have come to expect. At September 30, Microchip’s accounts receivable balance was $202.8 million, an increase of 4.8% from the balance as of the end of June. Receivables are in great condition with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. As of September 30, Microchip’s cash and total investment position was approximately $1.57 billion. The September quarter set a new record for Microchip with $156.9 million of cash generation prior to the dividend payment of $63.9 million. Our cash generation continues to be strong and our total cash and investment position is projected to grow by approximately $125 to $135 million in the December quarter prior to the dividend payments. Capital spending was approximately $31.8 million for the September quarter. We are continuing to invest in equipment to support the revenue growth of our new products and technologies and our capital expenditure forecast for fiscal 2011 is about $120 million. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $23.9 million, which was up from depreciation of $22.4 million in the June quarter. If you have questions related to the financials for the June or September quarters due to the inclusion of the super flash memory and RF businesses of SST, please refer to the supplemental financial information tab on the investor relations page of Microchip’s website. Gordon and I will also be available to answer questions from investors and analysts following today’s call. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank Eric and good afternoon everyone. Micro controllers, analog and memory products delivered another quarter of strong growth in the September quarter. Let’s now take a closer look at each of our product lines as well as flash IP licensing which starting last quarter, became our fourth reporting segment. Starting with micro controllers, this business delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 4.7% on a sequential basis and up 39.4% from the year ago quarter, achieving a new record. Micro controller business also broke through $1 billion annualized revenue for the first time ever, reflecting the strong growth in our micro controller business in 2010. We expect to ship our nine billionth cumulative micro controller shipped in the December quarter, having shipped the eight billionth micro controller just in the March quarter of this year. Our 8-bit micro controller business had another strong quarter, achieving a new record as all segment of our 8-bit product line again experienced very strong growth. Our 16-bit micro controller business also achieved another record for quarterly revenue, with strong sequential growth of 22% and up 102% from the year ago quarter. New customers and new designs going into production continued to drive significant growth as the number of volume 16-bit customers grew to over 3,200 customers. Our 32-bit micro controller product line, which had 36% sequential growth in March, and 86% sequential growth in the June quarter, took a pause and declined 10.9% in the September quarter. This is quite normal for a new product line where revenue growth tends to be more lumpy as we saw during similar phases of growth in our 16-bit and analog businesses several years ago. 32-bit micro controller revenue for the first six months of fiscal year ‘11 was 320% higher than the equivalent period in fiscal year ‘10 and I fully expect we will set a new record in the December quarter. The number of customers and volume production for 32-bit micro controller grew by 56% to 417 as we continue to build broad based customers to grow this business. Moving to development tools, we shipped 48,970 development tools in the September quarter including our one millionth cumulative development tools. Development tool sales remain an excellent leading indicator of continued strong design and activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers, and the continued trend strong development tools sales bodes well for our future growth. Now moving to our analog products, this business also delivered outstanding results with strong sequential growth of 11.6% and 99.8% growth versus the year ago quarter to achieve another record high for revenue. The marks the sixth consecutive quarter of double digit growth for our analog business. In the first six months of fiscal year ‘11, our analog business has grown 110.8% as compared to the same six months of fiscal year ‘10. We’re very pleased with the design win and revenue momentum of our analog business so far, and we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new products which we expect will contribute to ongoing strong revenue growth in the coming quarters. Moving to memory, our memory business is now comprised of our dsPIC memory products as well as our super flash memory products. This business was up 12.5% on a sequential basis and we continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our micro controller customers to complete their solutions. In regards to flash IP licensing, the revenue for the September quarter was $17.3 million, up 12.5% from the June quarter. We are very optimistic about the potential for this business to add to our ongoing growth and profitability. Moving to manufacturing and lead times, during the quarter, we continued to increase our manufacturing output at a measured rate to support our growth. Our current lead times are predominately at approximately six weeks and still well below where most of our competitors are at. We continue to capitalize on this strength to further grow our market share by enabling existing as well as new customers to achieve their business objectives with Microchip solutions. I will now pass it to Steve for some general comments as well as our guidance going forward.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you Ganesh. As I reflect on the September quarter, it was yet Microchips best quarter ever in our history. I want to thank the entire Microchip team including the employees that joined us from SST for delivering an outstanding quarter in many, many respects. We made new records in many aspects of our business. We achieved record sales in micro controllers, analog and licensing businesses. We also achieved record non-GAAP operating profit of $138.2 million and record cash flow of $156.9 million in September quarter. The September quarter also marked our 80’th consecutive profitable quarter. This is 20 years of making profit every quarter in good times and in bad, a record that is unmatched among our peers and is testimony to the resiliency of the business model that we have developed and fine-tuned over time. I will now provide guidance for December 2010 quarter. Microchip’s book to bill ratio for September was .87. While our own inventory and distributor’s inventories are in check, and were flat in days from June quarter, we are seeing an industry inventory correction. December quarter is historically the weakest quarter of the year for Microchip. Considering all that, we expect our net sales for the December quarter to be down between 2% to 8% sequentially. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59.1% to 59.3% for the December quarter and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.55 and $0.59. Given all the complications of accounting for a large acquisition including purchased inventory write up, amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges, like many other companies have done, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track it’s results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results will provide more meaningful comparisons to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates for this call. With that, operator would you please poll for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) We’ll go to Doug Freedman with Gleacher & Company.
Doug Freedman: Thank you for taking my question. Steve, you know clearly things are moving pretty quickly in the industry right now. I mean last quarter we were looking at being completely booked and very bullish on the December quarter and clearly bookings reversed course. Can you give us a sense of how things are tracking right now and how long you think we’re going to be in this situation? Do you think we’ll start to see a seasonal Q1? What’s your outlook look like?
Steve Sanghi: Well what changed here was our bookings started to slow down in September as the broad based inventory correction in the industry started to take hold. There was also some backlog that was scheduled for December quarter which got pushed out into March as customers decided to adjust their inventory and the backlog. We get this question in every cycle. If you look at the history of Microchip, there have been only two or three instances where we have had a back to back two quarter decline in revenue. One was during the global financial crisis in December of ‘08 and then down further in March of ‘09. And the other one was I believe going back to the tech bust of 2000. In most other cases, I think in every other case almost, we usually see one quarter decline, which we are experiencing here in the December quarter, and then the inventory corrects, and then we usually start the recovery. As you know, Microchip does accounting very, very conservatively. We do not book any revenue around the world based on a shipment to distributor. We look at sales out 100%. There are many of our competitors who track the results based on sell in and there are some others who are hybrid, who many of them take U.S. at sell out, but Europe and Asia they go sell in. Microchip goes sell out worldwide as we recognize the revenue. So it’s pretty conservative accounting and therefore, what is in distribution, whether distribution lowers or increases their inventory, does not have effect on our revenue. We only have effect with the end customers that are adjusting their inventory and we expect that to happen this quarter.
Shawn Boyd: Thank you for the detailed answer. If I could move on to other thing that’s really changed in the model, and that is rolling in the super flash memory, producing more memory. It is pulling down the corporate wide reported gross margins on a pro forma basis. You guys have had a history of sort of turning lower gross margin businesses into higher gross margin businesses. Can we expect the same type of results here? What is your thoughts on where you can take corporate wide gross margins?
Steve Sanghi: Well in the last six months we have already significantly improved the gross margins of the businesses we’re keeping and the process has just begun. There is a lot more to go, so you’re correct that we’ll continue to improve the gross margin of the super flash memory as well as the other businesses that we have decided to keep. Now the combined gross margin with the licensing are still very healthy, but these two businesses, gross margin will further increase into the next year under Microchip’s cloak. We expect our overall non-GAAP gross margin to go back to have a 61 or something in front of it as it historically has been. I think our long-term guidance always has been in that 61, 62 range, and we should be able to get back in that range over the next year.
Shawn Boyd: Perfect. Thank you, and I’ll jump back in the queue if I have any follow ups.
Steve Sanghi: Thanks.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence Whalen: Hi. Great, thanks for fitting me in. This one pertains to some of the additional businesses that you have taken on from SST. I think you made a comment in your prepared remarks that you had greatly improved the gross margin of the business. I just wanted to make sure that I understand correctly. On the additional $40 million of revenue from SST, it looks like the gross margin of that additional business was about $10 million or about 25% gross margin if I assume that you did attain your 62.5% gross margin on your core business. Is that correct?
Steve Sanghi: Your assessment of $10 million on 40 is not correct. We’re not breaking up the margins on individual businesses. We never do, but from what I know off the top of my head, your calculation of 25% is not correct. We would not have kept a 25% gross margin business.
Terence Whalen: OK.
Steve Sanghi: Somewhere your calculation is wrong, but you are way under.
Terence Whalen: What I’m calculating is the 62.5% gross margin, so the guided gross margin on the base revenue and then looking at the differential to what actual gross profit you printed on a GAAP basis and I get the $10 million additional on that 40.
Steve Sanghi: I’m telling you, your calculation is somewhere grossly wrong. Eric Bjornholt can walk you offline.
Terence Whalen: I guess a corollary then would be, so was the base business gross margin within normal expectations or was it slightly below expectations as it came in?
Steve Sanghi: I think you are excluding the licensing. So you know we added the $40 million of super flash memory and RF business, which was previously held as a non-core asset, but there was some micro controller business and there was some licensing business that was previously uncontinued business which we had already added to our numbers, so the gross margin profile had substantially changed before adding those businesses.
Terence Whalen: I’ll follow up with Eric perhaps. If I could just ask a follow up, I think Steve you had mentioned that the distribution inventory levels were at a fairly reasonably balanced level. I was hoping you could comment perhaps on different regions if you feel certain regions have more inventory or certain regions have less inventory. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: You want to comment on that Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: I think that the distribution inventory was pretty flat quarter on quarter in days, and there wasn’t any real variations that we saw quarter on quarter by region. It was fairly consistent.
Terence Whalen: Great. Thank you and I’ll re-queue. Thanks.
Operator: We’ll go next to James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I think last quarter you talked about given the big backlog that you had, that a large percentage of your bookings were outside the current quarter. Could you maybe – obviously that’s changed a little bit. Could you give us a quantification of at this point what percentage of your backlogs are outside the December quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Well as Ganesh mentioned in his remarks, the lead times now on most of our products is about six weeks, so with that, the large amount of bookings now are really falling in the quarter. Some of them are going outside, but with the lead times coming in, you have the natural correction that people don’t have to place a lot of bookings into the following quarter.
James Schneider: OK. That’s helpful. And then I think there’s been a pretty well publicized correction in the consumer electronics and computing spaces specifically. I know you don’t have a ton of exposure to computing, but can you maybe just comment on the end market trends that you’re seeing overall for your different customer groups?
Ganesh Moorthy: I think it is true that the consumer electronic segment has been one that has been weak. Some of the other ones, industrial, automotive are not as weak as perhaps the consumer and computing, but the correction is not all consumption driven. Some of it is inventory driven, so it may not all reflect end market consumption necessarily.
Steve Sanghi: Like it always happens when the lead times go as long as they had, you always have customers build a little bit of inventory, start to buy a little more than what they really needed, and at the time it never looks like anybody is building inventory because everybody’s expediting and they want more and they’re complaining about lead time. But when the capacity catches up and the lead times come down, we’ve seen it from time to time, there always been some adjustment because the customers don’t need everything they were planning to buy, because some of that they were trying to buy for safety. So that’s sort of what we’re seeing right now.
James Schneider: Understood. That’s helpful color. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Chris Caso of Susquehanna Financial Group.
Chris Caso: Thank you. I just wonder if you could give a little color in terms of linearity and I guess you said that the decline in bookings started in September. Could you give a sense of where that’s been in quarter to date in October and sort of what your customers are telling you now? I guess we’ve heard from some others in the space is that the leads times come down that they’re expecting to see a continuing deceleration of bookings through the end of the quarter. Is that your view as well?
Steve Sanghi: Well I think what we have experienced is we’ve reached the bottom of the deceleration several weeks ago. The bookings were quite weak in September. It wasn’t having an effect on the quarter last quarter, because when the booking weakened in September, those bookings were not for September quarter because September quarter was filled. So the September bookings were really for some for the December quarter, some even for January because the lead times were longer. So as the lead times started to come down, those bookings dried up, so therefore bookings became much smaller, and we experienced really the bottom I would say three weeks ago.
Ganesh Moorthy: Three weeks ago, and it’s been fairly consistent in that time frame since.
Steve Sanghi: And since then, the bookings have been more normalized. Now they’re normalized within our tracking where we’re not booking far out in time like we were before, the bookings have normalized to the point where we are now getting the bookings that we really should be getting for the quarter. Is it all corrected yet? Probably not. They’re still lower than we would like, but they’re no longer going down. They’re really stable now.
Chris Caso: OK, great. And if you could remind us what you consider to be normal seasonality in your March quarter and I guess you made a comment earlier that you’ve only seen two times where the revenue has declined for two quarters in a row. Is that still your view this time?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, which I mentioned earlier in answer to a prior question, we expect that we should correct in the December quarter and then March quarter will not be down further, so we should see some small growth in the March quarter.
Chris Caso: What’s normal seasonality for the March quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Well I don’t know what normal is these days.
Ganesh Moorthy: I think if you take out any of the major industry events, it’s probably flat to up 3%, kind of in that range. Europe is typically very strong in the March quarter and Asia is a bit weaker due to the Chinese New Year.
Chris Caso: OK, great. That’s helpful. Thanks you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Chris Danley with J.P. Morgan.
Chris Danley: I guess Chris part two. Hey Steve, so if we think of the March quarter being normal seasonality, how would you expect your gross margins and operating expense to trend? Can we expect the gross margins to improve based on further improvements in the acquired gross margin business and do you think you can squeeze a little more percent out of the newly combined entity?
Steve Sanghi: We have squeezed a lot of operating expense out of the entity and you could see the operating expenses on a historic basis are fairly low, in the 24% range. So the idea is really not to squeeze more out of the operating expenses below the critical mass when instead, invest in these growth businesses. So to really have a further reduction of operating expenses on these levels, if you do an industry comparison, these are very, very low operating expense as a percentage of revenue.
Ganesh Moorthy: I’d add to that, particularly in a quarter where we’re guiding to the down in revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of sales is remaining fairly flat, 24 to 24.25.
Steve Sanghi: So as for the gross margin is concerned, you have seen the story play out so many different times in every cycle where through the cycle we make high high’s and we make higher lows in the gross margin, so if you look at the prior cycle, the gross margin at the bottom were much lower. This quarter we expect this quarter to mark the bottom and then gross margin to slowly starting to improve. Whether it happens next quarter, I really haven’t figured it out yet, but basically you should see decrease in gross margin this quarter along with a decrease in revenue. Next quarter if the revenue improves, we should really have some follow through and gross margins start to improve. But it takes a quarter or so before they start to improve.
Chris Danley: OK, great. And then for my follow up, on the super flash memory RF, you said that you could get that back to sort of company average margins. Any estimate or revenue level on how long that will take and do you think it will settle in somewhere between (E squared) and Micro’s or will it be closer to one of the other one when you get it going to where you want it to be.
Steve Sanghi: We don’t want to talk about individual product line gross margins because any customer listening buying that product, we don’t want them to think that they’re paying XYZ, so what I basically said is that we should be able to take the overall corporate gross margin, put a six in front of it again. We were 60.2 last quarter. We’re guiding 59.1 to 59.2 this quarter. We should be able to put a six in front of it and eventually late into next year, we should be able to put a 61 in front of it. By improving the overall utilization and absorption of the factories and improving the products as the overall revenue improves. There’s a contribution from the improvement of super flash memory and RF, but there’s also contribution from the overall absorption. Remember, super flash memory and RF, the $40 million, the 10% of revenue overall (inaudible) overall can’t make that large a difference. We have to improve the overall utilization to get roughly 2%, 2.5% improvement over time.
Chris Danley: OK. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We’ll go next to John Barton of Cowen and Company.
John Barton: Thanks. Could you update us on the progress of integrating super flash IT and the core products and any updated news on the competitive advantages you expect to gain from that going into the future?
Steve Sanghi: Well we were using SST’s technology into our products well before the acquisition, as long as five years ago, and we were basically using that technology as a license, and now we’re the owners. So what it allows us is access to more broader technology of SST and go deeper into (inaudible) and be able to use more advanced technology which is currently under development. In the past we’ll have access to what really available out on the market which sometimes is many years old, and we’re already starting to develop products. Six months is not a lot of time to develop a micro controller, but we’re already starting to develop products which will be on the advanced leading edge of technology.
John Barton: And since the announcement of the acquisition, you were very comfortable that your ownership of that IP would not impact the licensing to competitors, other people playing in the micro controller area. Based upon continued interaction with those customers, are you still very comfortable on that topic?
Steve Sanghi: Yeah, extremely. There was an issue concern by our competitors that how will it work, then licensing the technology from Microchip which was one of their competitors in the micro controller business, but after six months, they have seen that we have operated the licensing business basically with a firewall and almost at arm’s length from the Microchips micro controller business. The licensing business reports directly to me, and we have several licensing negotiations on the table. Just in the last week or so, we have signed one new one and there are at least four or five new licenses which are on the table being negotiated, and several of them should be signed this quarter and some will spill into next quarter. So as we speak, there is really absolutely no impact Microchip’s ownership and the licensing business. It did record last quarter. We are confident it will do another record again this quarter.
John Barton: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.
Brendan Furlong: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Quick question on the $40 million on guidance for next quarter. How does it compare with the $40 million on super flash and RF? Is that down a similar amount sequentially?
Steve Sanghi: We don’t really break out individual product lines. We haven’t in the past and whether it’s micro controllers or analog, we just give a corporate guidance. The memory and RF divisions will be split. The RF will be reported along with our overall analog revenue as it was reported in the last quarter and memory will be combined with Microchip’s memory business and reported as a memory segment. So we’ll compare the total memory to memory, which will include (inaudible) and super flash, and the analog will include our analog products, the RF products and analog products also include some of the portion of the wireless products division we have that also makes some analog products.
Brendan Furlong: That’s helpful. Thank you. I guess what I’m really trying to get at is what’s the apples to apples comparison if you didn’t have – if you weren’t including this business now, as you had originally planned to do.
Steve Sanghi: I don’t think there are many difference. I think they’re all – industry has seen similar stuff. One business could be 2% higher, and one business could be 2% lower, and those are such differences in the Microchip also. As Ganesh pointed out, our 8-bit micro, 16, 32 analog, they all had different percentage growth, but they are really not huge anomalies of any kind if that’s what you’re trying to get to.
Brendan Furlong: OK, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: We’ll go next to Ray Rund with Shaker Investments.
Ray Rund: My question has actually been answered. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome back Ray. Long time.
Ray Rund: Not that long, Steve. We’ve been following you and knowing you since 1996.
Steve Sanghi: Ok. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Uche Orji with UBS.
Steve Elisque [ph]: It’s Steve Elisque [ph] for Uche. I have a couple of questions. First of all, on the licensing business, it grew very nicely in Q2, but we only have a couple data points in terms of seeing that business. How should we expect that to grow longer term? Is it going to be lumpy or should we expect some continued type of double digit growth here?
Steve Sanghi: Well I can’t give you any long term guidance because we’ve owned it ourselves for a short period of time, but they did make record last quarter. We expect another record in the December quarter even though all the other results will be down. So the licensing business should model approximately to the industry average growth plus the new licenses, the new technology, the new license we’re able to do. So these licenses are largely to micro controller and smart card customers and foundries who produce micro controllers and smart cards and some of the Logic products for some of our competitors and other companies, which could include micro controllers, SST kind of product, custom chips, DSP’s, smart cards and some of the Logic chips. So the royalty stream of that will largely be similar really to what the industry average is doing because that’s the royalty we get. On top of that you have to add the new licenses, because we’re expanding it, getting more foundries, more competitors, more technologies into the fold. So all that, how we can model it long term, I don’t really know yet (inaudible).
Steve Elisque [ph]: And switching gears here on wireless technology, you now have RF capability from SST. You have your 802.11 from your ZeroG acquisition and Zigby, how do we think about wireless technology is going for you forward? Is it like analog where initially it’s an enabler, or it’s enabled by your micro controller growth longer term, it becomes a faster growing part of the business overall or is it integrally tied to certain markets that you’re focused on like the smart metering?
Steve Sanghi: I commend you. You’re keeping track of how we are accumulating technologies around, that’s our elbow out strategy and appreciate how we’re doing it, but I’ll let Ganesh answer that questions.
Ganesh Moorthy: I think you’re going to find that there’s several components to it. So the part of the wireless business that ties with the embedded control business is very much connected to our micro controllers. Often, the software that is running the system to enable the wireless communication to take place is running on our micro controllers, and so the solution is not just the wireless product, but it’s the wireless product, the software and the micro controller all sold together as a solution. We also have the RF business from SST that actually has other areas that it plays in, which are not necessarily all tied to micro controllers. It does also connect to micro controllers, but works with higher speed Wi-Fi systems and solutions and those could be going into market. Traditionally we don’t play as much as for example in cell phones. So there’s different components of the business. Some of it will grow with the micro controllers. Some of it will grow outside of the micro controllers.
Steve Elisque [ph]: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel Nicolaus.
Kevin Cassidy: Thanks for taking my question. On the 32-bit micro controllers, I understand it’s lumpy now as it’s a smaller portion of the business, but as that grows Steve, what kind of seasonality do you expect there just based on some of the design wins you have?
Ganesh Moorthy: I don’t expect seasonality to be a big function for this product line. It’s small. The number of new designs going into production are going to outweigh any kind of seasonality for many, many quarters and years to come, so right now I think it just reflects there are times when any given customer could be farther along in their production in any one quarter, not having to buy every single quarter. But as you’ve seen in the 16-bit, if you’ve followed us from the days of the analog, there can be one or two quarters where it is not as strong as the rest of the product line, but the long time trend tends to be substantially faster growth than the underlying product lines of Microchip.
Kevin Cassidy: OK. Thanks for that. And also, you’re keeping CapEx spending the same for fiscal year 2011 even though you’re bringing in the super flash and the RF businesses. Is there any expected change in the future or is there going to be any moving around of the manufacturing?
Steve Sanghi: Well the super flash and RF businesses are largely run at the sub-contractor. That’s how the SST business was structured. They’re completely fab (inaudible) and they didn’t do any of their own assembly or tests. So this year, in this fiscal year, it’s really, there is not a lot of capital investment because most of the business continues to run at the sub-contractors.
Kevin Cassidy: OK. So plans of bringing that in house?
Steve Sanghi: No, no plan in a large way. I mean there are certain hiring liability requirements around automotive and industrial customers who would require the predictability and quality standards that Microchip factories have, so we’re putting some capability inside to be able to expand that business into higher margin and more stickier targets and stuff like that. Similar stuff we have done with our memory business to improve margins and create stability and have a higher quality business and complete our micro controller solutions. So we’re doing that. But those are small capacities and some of those we already have because systems are similar to what Microchip uses, and if you need to buy something it doesn’t move the needle.
Kevin Cassidy: OK, great. Thanks.
Operator: We’ll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Yeah, thanks guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve, given your comments earlier that kind of the booking decline has stopped and March is looking up, I’m kind of curious, do you think that materializes itself in sequential growth in the December quarter and/or book to bill of greater than one or do you think in this kind of environment, if March is up, it’s just on the back of a better turn environment?
Steve Sanghi: That’s a very good question. I would really be speculating what the book to bill would be this quarter. I think as the lead times continue to come in, people have to place longer term backlog less and less. And when we say book to bill ratio, we look at total bookings divided by billings for the quarter. So your bookings can be lower for several quarters because people are not placing longer term backlog, so therefore, if you look at some of the past cycles, we’ve had less than one book to bill ratio, and yet we had growth for a few quarters.
Kevin Cassidy: Perfect. And then I guess, the little bit on the analog business, if you look at sort of the Q3 or the September ‘08 level to today, the business has almost doubled and I’m curious, and I know you don’t like to give product specific guidance for the December quarter, but is analog still on a growth trajectory this quarter and kind of what’s the outlook over the next several quarters?
Steve Sanghi: Well analog is doing very well as you’ve seen. It’s doubled and it should continue to do well next year. How does it do specifically this quarter as a breakdown, I don’t really know. We don’t break it out.
Kevin Cassidy: And then I guess guys my last question, I apologize if I missed this, but did you give revenue breakdown for the September by geo?
Eric Bjornholt: No, we didn’t, but Asia was 58% and the America’s and Europe were both about 2% of sales.
Kevin Cassidy: OK. Thanks guys.
Steve Sanghi: The geo numbers have changed dramatically as we integrated the $40 million coming from SST, so if you’re comparing it to any prior numbers you have on record, and you see some geo’s change in a step function way, then don’t interpret that as we’re not doing good in America, because it went from 25 to 21, things like that. SST business was very much dominated in Asia, and that’s the impact.
Kevin Cassidy: Great. Thanks.
Operator: We’ll go next to Janet Ramkissoon with Quatra Capital.
Steve Sanghi: Hello Janet.
Janet Ramkissoon: Hi Steve. Quick question about margins, and this question was asked before, but maybe I could ask it a different way to try to get some clarity. If we were to add back the royalty revenue into the super flash business, would that be giving us any numbers? Could you give us a sense of how close it is to your corporate margins of last quarter, and if it’s below, could you give us some sense as to how many quarters it might be before you’re able to do what you normally do, bring the margins up to the corporate level. And secondly, if you could just comment on the business trends in India and China, I’d appreciate it. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: Well there were three questions in there. If you take the licensing business and peel it back out of Microchip because we had consolidated that in the prior quarter already, but if you peel it out and combine it together with the super flash and RF business, which was one of your questions, then the margins coming out of SST are very comparable. They’re in the range. They are lower than Microchip, but they’re not – they’re in the range. Second part of your question was how long will it take for us to gain, get above 61. You tell me what the environment will be next year, how much we’ll be up in revenue.
Janet Ramkissoon: Steve, I was specifically talking about the SST business. When would it – you basically answered the question. You said that it was pretty close. So I just wanted to know how long it will take to get to regular corporate margins. So I think you basically said that it was (inaudible).
Steve Sanghi: (Inaudible) but around 35 brackets, it’s close, and it will continue to improve. But there are always two components in improving gross margin. One is time. Another is revenue, because revenue provides the leverage in most things to absorb expenses, to create automation, to do more pilot testing, to have lower prices and materials and assembly and test and all that. So there’s always a revenue issue. Many times I get that question from the street. They just think it’s kind of time based. It’s time and revenue based. Time obviously allows shrink products to get in and products to succeed which are trying to bring a lower cost. It is also a revenue equation. If the revenue does not grow for any given product line, then it becomes margin challenged. So here, we believe that into the next year, we’ll have to have all of those things; the market environment would be better than what we’re experiencing in December and with the product shrink assembly and test and all the Microchip infrastructure and our skills to improve margin, you will not be displeased with the margin. You never have been in the past through the cycles and we’ll demonstrate that again.
Janet Ramkissoon: OK. And just about any commentary on the business conditions in India and China. I appreciate it.
Steve Sanghi: You want to take a shot at it?
Ganesh Moorthy: China is really the larger business for us and China had a growth quarter in the September quarter, but perhaps not as much growth as we would have liked to see.
Janet Ramkissoon: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Craig Ellis of Caris & Company.
Craig Ellis: Brett here for Craig. Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe could you just talk a little bit about your acquisition strategy going forward, how soon you’re looking at companies and would you kind of continue with the theme of building out wireless, or how should we look at that?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we never stop looking at any point in time. At any point in time we have an active funnel and companies come in the funnel and we don’t like them, or they don’t check out or they’re not accretive or we don’t find them good, or we don’t like the management or we don’t like the financials or whatever reason. This is a needle in the haystack kind of thing. We look at a lot of companies and really do very few. But one result of that is, we’ve done six acquisitions in the last two years or so, and we’re pleased with all of them. They’re all successful. There was the Hampshire company, there was (inaudible) International, there was High Tech Software, there was ZeroG, there was SST. All these companies, they’re all very, very successful. It is because the rigorous methodology we have in figuring out really when we want to buy something. If any of the things don’t check out, then we do not buy them. So we have an active funnel, but beyond that, we can’t say what it would be or what area it could be in. Many of them tend to be private companies and many of them tend to be public companies, so or that the price goes up and that’s not helpful to the investors or us.
Craig Ellis: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: OK. We want to thank all the shareholders and analysts. On this call we tried to detail out for you right in the beginning how the SST business was accounted for because otherwise it makes the comparisons more difficult and because of changing the accounting of the SST business, we have restated the fiscal first quarter, which was the June quarter. And the details of all that is on our website in case you didn’t catch it, and it would be helpful to look at it so you understand the FQ1 to FQ2 June to September finances a little bit better. There are many conferences we’re going to this quarter, so we’ll see many of you on the road. With that, thank you very much. Bye, bye.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip Technology conference call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Thank you and good morning everybody. I want to apologize. I guess we were having some trouble with the IR page on our website, and so we are working diligently to get that updated, but we wanted to start the call and hopefully that gets up and running here shortly. So, during the course of this conference call we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements or predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip’s President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President and COO; and Gordon Parnell, Vice President, Business Development and Investor Relations. We will conduct today's conference call in two separate parts. The first part of the call will be our normal earnings call, followed by a question-and-answer session. And in the second part of today's call, we will summarize our announced acquisition of SST, and then hold a separate question-and-answer session relating to the acquisition. For our normal earnings call, I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2010 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment, discuss our guidance for the March quarter, and update other pertinent matters regarding our business. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Again, please hold any questions related to the acquisition of SST until you were prompted to queue up. Net sales for the December quarter were $250.1 million, up approximately 10.3% from net sales of $226.7 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 30.1% from net sales of $192.2 million in the December 2008 quarter. On a geographic basis, revenue in the Americas was up 6.1% in the December quarter, Europe was up 10.2% and Asia was up 12.4%. Asia continues to be our largest geographic region, representing 52.3% of sales in the December quarter. The Americas were 23.7% of sales, and Europe was 24% of sales. These measurements are based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes for our customers, but does not necessarily represent where the design activity is taking place or where the end product consumption is occurring. We are continuing to include information on our press release on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on our Investor Relations page of our Web site at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $70.1 million or $0.38 per diluted share, an increase of 31.2% from non-GAAP net income of $53.2 million or $0.29 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter. The after-tax impact on the December 2009 quarterly earnings that have been excluded from our non-GAAP results, include $8.5 million from a favorable tax settlement with the IRS, $7.7 million in share-based compensation expense, $1 million in non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, and $0.5 million in charges associated with our acquisition activities. GAAP net income was $69.4 million in the December quarter or $0.37 per diluted share. The favorable impact on GAAP EPS from the settlement with the IRS was $0.045 and will not be a recurring item in the March 2009 quarter. I will now go through some of the operating results for the December quarter. I will be referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis, prior to the effects of share-based compensation and acquisition related expenses. Gross margins were 59% in the December quarter compared to 55.5% in the September quarter. The 350 basis point quarterly increase in gross profit margin was driven by a variety of factors including higher production activity in our factories and continued cost reduction efforts from our global manufacturing operations. With the increase in revenue, we were able to achieve operating leverage from the business, with total operating expenses of 26.2% of sales in the December quarter compared to 27.7% in the prior quarter. Research and development costs were $27.2 million, representing 10.9% of sales. Sales and general administrative expenses were $38.4 million, representing 15.3% of sales. Our non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of sales were at approximately the same level in the December 2009 quarter as they were in September 2008 quarter, which was Microchip’s peak earnings quarter. The December operating expenses includes a substantial portions of all the cuts that we took in our employee compensation programs during the global financial crisis and the forecast that we have provided to the March 2010 quarter includes the full run rate of these programs. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition related expenses were 58.4%. Total operating expenses were $73.4 million or 29.4 % of sales and include share-based compensation of $7.6 million and acquisition related expenses of $0.3 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the tax rate for the December quarter was 13.4%. The GAAP effective tax rate for the December quarter was 0.7%. The difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate was driven from an 8.5 million favorable settlement with the IRS related to fiscal year 2002 through 2004, as well as the higher tax rate that applied to the non-cash interest expense on our convertible debt. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax advantage securities. We expect our going forward non-GAAP tax rate to be between 12.5% and 13%. The dividend declared today of $0.341 per share will be paid on March 10, 2010 to shareholders of record on February 18, 2010. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $62.9 million. Moving on to the balance sheet, Microchip's inventory balance at December 31, 2009 was $112.8 million, representing approximately 99 days. Inventory on Microchip's balance sheet increased by $4.3 million or 3 days and days of inventory at our distributors increased to 40 days compared to 35 days at the end of the prior quarter. I would like to remind you that Microchip recognizes its distribution revenue on a sell-through basis in its worldwide distribution channel. At the end of December quarter, the combined inventory on Microchip's balance sheet and its distributors was 139 days, which is in the lower range of our historical averages. During the December quarter, we aggressively increased our manufacturing output so we can continue to satisfy the needs of our customers by providing industry best lead times. We expect inventory days on our balance sheet in the March quarter to be about flat. The increases in our production output will have ongoing positive impact on Microchip's gross margin percentage. At December 31, our receivables were $113.8 million, an increase of $7.1 million or 6.7% from the balance as of the September quarter. Receivable balances are in great condition with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. Over the past year we have not had any significant bad debt write-offs in our business. We continue to closely monitor customer activity to ensure we are protecting the receivable assets on our balance sheet. As of December 31, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1.5 billion. Our cash generation from the business was $89.4 million, prior to the payment of $62.5 million dividend. Our cash generation continues to be strong, and our total cash and investment position is projected to grow again in the March 2010 quarter. Capital spending was approximately $18.7 million for the December quarter, and our fiscal 2010 capital expenditure forecast is currently $50 million. We are investing in equipments to support the revenue growth of our new products and technologies, and are also taking advantage of low cost equipment opportunities in the marketplace, that will position us well for future growth. Depreciation expense for the December quarter was $21.7 million, which was flat to depreciation in the September quarter. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. I will now comment on the individual product lines. All three of our product lines, Microcontrollers, Analog and Serial EEPROMs delivered outstanding growth in the December quarter. We continue to see the results of our strategy to stay invested in our new product development and demand creation resources during the global recession. By employing a shared sacrifice to cut costs instead of resorting to mass layoffs, we believe, we are seeing the continuation of differentiated revenue growth and operating profit results. Let me now take a closer look at each of our product lines, starting with Microcontrollers. Our Microcontroller business delivered superb results and was up a strong 10% on a sequential basis and up 30% from the year ago quarter. The December quarter was also the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth for the Microcontroller business. Flash microcontrollers represented 81.3% of our Microcontroller business in the December quarter. Our 8-bit Microcontroller business had another excellent quarter as all segments of our 8-bit product line experienced very strong growth. Our 16-bit microcontroller business achieved another record for quarterly revenue with strong sequential growth of 10%, building upon the 49% sequential growth we had last quarter. 16-bit microcontrollers also grew over 101% from the year ago quarter. New customers and new designs going to production continued to help drive growth as a number of volume 16-bit customers grew by 239 customers to 2,289. Our 32-bit microcontroller product line meanwhile continues to make good progress with 44% sequential growth, albeit from a smaller base, building upon the 56% sequential growth we had last quarter. We now have 173 32-bit microcontroller customers in volume production. Moving to development tools, we had another record quarter with 41,492 development tools shipped in the December quarter, the third consecutive quarter of record development tool sales. As you have seen from our growth in recent quarters, development tool sales are an excellent leading indicator of continued strong designing activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers, and the continued strength of record development tool sales should bode well for future growth. Now moving to the analog products, our Analog business also delivered outstanding results with very strong sequential growth of 14.1% and 40% growth versus the year ago quarter to achieve record high revenues. This also marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our analog business, and the first time we have crossed the greater than 100 million annualized revenue run rate. Growth was especially strong in the linear, interface and safety and security product lines. We are very pleased with the design win and revenue momentum our analog business has shown. We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new products that we expect will contribute to continued strong revenue growth in the coming quarters. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of ZeroG Wireless, an innovator in low-power WiFi solutions for the embedded market that complements our broad portfolio of microcontrollers. ZeroG was a private company located in Silicon Valley and is in an early revenue stage. Now moving to Serial EE [ph] memory products, this business was up 9.8% sequentially. We were pleased to see solid growth in this area of our embedded control products. We continue to run this business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. At a time when many of our competitors have significantly pushed out their lead times to between 14 weeks and 26 weeks, Microchip's investment in inventory, use of flexible rotating time off in our factories during the recession and ongoing operational excellence has enabled us to continue to provide industry leading lead times. In the current environment this is translating to further growth in our market share as we are better able to respond to rapidly rising customer demand, capitalizing our competitors inability to supply products, as well as to instill confidence in customers as to who they should commit new designs to, so that they're assured a future supply. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments, as well as our guidance for the March quarter. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good morning everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the December quarter, then I would answer some of the investor and analyst concerns that we have heard in the last few months. Then I will talk about our guidance for March 2010 quarter. Reflecting on the December quarter, I want to thank the entire Microchip team for delivering an outstanding quarter in every respect. We beat the upper end of our revised guidance in the net sales, gross margins, operating profits, earnings per share and free cash flow by a significant margin. It is also the first time in over 15 years that we have achieved three consecutive quarters with over 10% sequential growth in net sales. We also beat the lower end of our operating expense and inventory guidance by a good margin. We have now been profitable for 77 consecutive quarters and the March quarter will be our 78th. From a geographical standpoint, as Eric discussed, we achieved substantial sequential growth in all major geographies of the world, and on product lines the story was impressive too. As Ganesh discussed, we achieved significant sequential growth in all of our product lines, with microcontrollers up 10%, 16-bit microcontrollers up by 10% sequentially, and analog up by 14.1% sequentially. I also wanted to highlight the comparison to SIA numbers that were recently released. While Microchip does not participate in SIA and short-term SIA numbers are often suspect, many of the investors and analysts follow those numbers. So, based on this SIA data, calendar year 2009 industry sales for 8, plus 16-bit microcontrollers were down 23.6% from calendar 2008. Microchip's 8-bit plus 16-bit sales for calendar 2009 were down 14.6% from calendar 2008. So 23.6% for the industry and 14.6% for Microchip. If you look at December quarter 2009 over December quarter 2008, so last quarter over a year ago quarter, then the industry 8-bit, plus 16-bit microcontrollers sales were up 12.3%, while Microchip’s 8-bit plus 16-bit MCU sales were up a whopping 29.6%. So industry had 12.3% up and Microchip up 29.6% showing significant market share gains. We are gaining share in both 8 as well as 16-bit microcontrollers. Next, I would like to discuss four concerns that investors and analysts have raised in the last several months. The first of these concerns is, where are Microchip’s growth drivers. The best way to prove that growth is by posting strong sequential growth, which we have been doing for several quarters. Beyond that there are five major drivers of growth. First is our multi-year demand creation program in which we added 28% additional sales and application personnel three years ago. Then we retained them through the global financial crisis of last year. They have created a steady stream of new customers and new design wins that are turning to production adding to our growth. Second, we have an industry leading design engineering awareness of our 8, 16 and 32-bit microcontroller solutions. On 8-bit microcontrollers, we're the number one choice of designers by a wide margin. On 16 and 32-bit we're tied in the number first place. Number three, we have significantly expanded our served available market with the introduction of our 400 new products in the last three years, covering several key thrust areas like extreme low-power, touch sense, USB interface, advanced graphics, high-performance analog, Ethernet connectivity, RF connectivity, motor control, and digital power supply. Number four, our Analog business is growing and gaining market share. We are gaining by attaching analog to our microcontroller application, as well as embedding analog functionality on the microcontroller dye. And number five, we are gaining share from large but financially strapped competitors. The second area of concern that investors and analysts have shown is the gross margin percentage. In the earnings call in November, we shared our internal plan for calendar year ’10. We gave a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.5% for the year, which was lower than our prior peaks. That left the impression that gross margins are challenged. We have already exceeded that gross margin for the December ’09 quarter, and we have guided 60% gross margin for the March 2010 quarter. We now believe that we will achieve our previous record gross margin of 61.6% non-GAAP by the end of this fiscal year ‘11. The third area of concern has been operating expenses. Analysts have the impression that there are large operating expenses coming that are not in the model. That is not correct. In the quarter we just announced the operating expense was 26.2% non-GAAP, which matched the operating expense in our record quarter of fiscal Q2 09. From September to December quarter, that we just completed, our operating expenses grew by 4.3% while sales grew by 10.3%. In the March 2010 quarter, we have all of the employee compensation programs back in the operating expenses, and we expect the operating expenses to stay in this range of 26.2% as a percentage of sales. The final concern shown has been that the inventories are getting replenished and hence it is at the cycle top. Microchip’s inventories plus our distributors’ inventories combined are the lower end of historical days of sales. We have always differentiated ourselves from the competition by maintaining some short lead times. If we could say anything about our inventory, our inventory at Microchip is lower than we would ideally like, while our distribution inventories in reasonable range. We are continuing to make the necessary changes to bring inventories in line with customers’ needs and maintain the best lead plans in the industry, but because of strong growth that we are experiencing, we expect inventory to really stay flat in the March quarter as Eric talked about. Having addressed these investors and analyst concerns, I will now move to provide guidance for March 2010 quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio for December quarter was 1.12. And we started the March quarter with an all-time record high backlog. So the visibility is improving significantly. The bookings rate so far in the quarter has been very strong. This quarter we see significantly higher shipping days in US and Europe, but lower shipping days in Asia, because of Lunar New Year. Considering all that, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be up between 3% and 7% sequentially, above what normal seasonality is for our business. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59.75% and 60.25%, which is 75 basis points to 125 basis points improvement over the December quarter, and we expect our GAAP gross margin to be between 58.85% and 59.35%. Regarding earnings per share for the March quarter, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.39 and $0.41. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.34 and $0.36. Now, I would like to comment on the longer-term outlook for calendar year '10, and this outlook for calendar year ‘10, excludes the acquisition of SST that we just announced. We will talk about it later. Last quarter, we shared our internal plan for calendar year ‘10 with investors and the financial community. We talked about calendar year ’10 revenue of $1.05 billion, up 25% from calendar year ‘09. This internal forecast met with skepticism from several of the analysts. I'm happy to tell you that after one quarter, we see our calendar year ’10 plan to be quite conservative. With just March quarter’s revenue times four we met our internal plan. And I have already talked about gross margin for calendar year ‘10 to be well above our internal plan. While we won't be revising our internal plan every quarter, we are confident of beating it by a significant margin. So, as we said in the start of the call, we will first take questions from investors and analysts about our earnings and our guidance, and after that we will make some more commentary about the SST acquisition followed by a second questions and answers period. With that operator would you please poll for questions.
Operator:
 :
Uche Orji – UBS: Sure. Thank you very much. Steve, let me just settle by asking you about where you are now with regards to utilization rates? This has provided some boost to margins, obviously. If we're looking to going forward, how much more upside could come from that? And also, if you can talk about where you see structurally margins going? In the opening remarks, you commented that you are now likely to be back to – by the end of this year, to the levels where – at your peak levels. Is there any structural feeling to gross margins, any way for us to think of where gross margins would get to? So if you can comment on some drivers that would be helpful, thanks.
Steve Sanghi: Uche, we don't provide specific capacity utilization levels, as it just seems to create confusion with investors and analysts. People seem to do a straight extrapolation, and in reality it doesn't quite work that way. We see continued gross margin improvement in our fiscal fourth quarter based on the non-GAAP guidance we provided 59.75 to 60.25, and we also indicated earlier that we should get back to our prior peak gross margins of 61.6% non-GAAP over the next four quarters by the end of fiscal year ‘11. And you know, that gets to the prior peak gross margins, and that is why we believe that without SST that is sort of where our business model is.
Uche Orji – UBS: Yes. Just a different question, you talked about you were capitalizing on long lead times by your competitors and taking share as a consequence. If you're able to please comment where by product this is happening? This is the 8-bit or 16-bit or – and also by product. If you can just give us some color as to where you have seen the competitors struggling to meet demand and you're seeing incremental share gains. So that will be very helpful. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: You know the delivery performance from the competitors span all their product lines 8s, 16s and 32s. Obviously, our large market presence is in 8-bit microcontrollers. So from a frequency standpoint that is the most frequent place where we see that inroad happening. But it affects more than just today's design that we can switch to Microchip by helping the customer take advantage of our supply, and helping them on the technical side to make the conversion. It affects their confidence about future designs. As they look at future designs, that can affect 8, 16 or 32 because when customers do their designs they want to be able to take it to production, and they want a supplier who has manufacturing output that lines up with what they are trying to ship.
Operator: And our next question will come from the side of Romit Shah with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.
Romit Shah – Barclays Capital: Hi, guys. Steve, you talked about fewer shipping days in Asia this quarter. Do you still expect that region to grow in the March period?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, the backlog and the bookings we are seeing from the Asia region is quite strong, and taking into account the less number of shipping days, the stronger shipping before it and then the recovery again afterwards, we're modeling some growth in that region.
Romit Shah – Barclays Capital: Okay. And then another question on margins. You talked about getting back to peak gross margins by the end of fiscal '11. Should we assume that operating margins would be in the mid-30% range under that scenario?
Steve Sanghi: Well, if you take 61.6% non-GAAP and the operating expense that we guided to about 26.2% range, then the rest of the math, you know, it gets to about mid-30s, yeah. 61.6 minus 26.2, 35.4.
Romit Shah – Barclays Capital: Thank you.
Operator: And another question will come from the side of John Barton with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
John Barton – Cowen & Company: Thank you very much. Steve, you reminded us that you'd given a 2010 forecast early. You're not updating that per se, but you kind of alluded to the fact that you think you will beat that. And obviously, the March guidance kind of sets the stage. As you're looking through 2010, when you think about end demand, do you think it kind of materializes in a normal seasonal fashion beyond the March quarter and then whatever share gains you get on top of that? Or do you think those end markets that are still yet to rebound from the inventory depletion mode that they were in?
Steve Sanghi: I think we have consistently said that across our 70,000 customers, and a large amount of our business coming from distribution, we don't really can break out the end demand for you by segment. You know, once in a while we have done analysis on some sample customers during the middle of the housing bust and all that, we can create an indicator for a short period of time, but customers move around regarding where they buy their product from. Many of them switch to distributors or CMs or whatever. So our product strategy has always been very horizontal in all of our product lines. We sell across thousands of applications, 70,000 customers and we're seeing a broad-based recovery in every geography around the world. And beyond that we can't really give you an end market commentary. We're seeing our business grow significantly better than our competitors. I did some comparisons to SIA this time and the last two or three times also. So we're seeing significant share gains. Our new product pipeline is really the best it has been in a long time because we stayed committed with our resources and product designs in the last year and a half, where many of our competitors laid off people and killed the product pipelines. Our lead times are shorter, our customer service is excellent. So customers are designing with us. So we see a very, very strong outlook in every way we look at it.
John Barton – Cowen & Company: Last quick one, if I could. Eric, if you could just comment on the other income line? Are the quarter-on-quarter changes we've seen purely interest rates? And then how do we think about that going forward?
Eric Bjornholt: Yes, that is primarily driven by interest rates. We have had some longer-term investments that we have made that have rolled off and then kind of reset to lower rates, and what we are able to invest on today. So that is the major driver, and then going forward, I would say that we're pretty much in a flattish mode. As we generate cash we invest that, but the investment returns at this point in time are pretty low.
Operator: And our next question will come from the side of Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan. Your line is open.
Harsh Kumar – Morgan Keegan & Co.: Hi, guys, first of all, congratulations on some tremendous numbers and guidance. A question for Steve, Steve, there's been a lot of dislocation in your competitive environment. I'm sure some of those guys will try to come back in the marketplace. So my question is on the design cycle. Let's say you take a design win in an appliance or other product, do you typically keep it for the life of the product or do you see these guys come back next year and try to get back in?
Steve Sanghi: Well, Harsh, we – once a customer does a design, everybody is so resource constrained these days, where people have laid off their resources, they have contracted them out. And once that design goes into production we rarely ever see in our industry the design mid-production switch. People switch mid-production design only if they cannot acquire the product or there are significant quality or other support issues. Otherwise, the design switching usually happens on subsequent design if you give the customer then a reason to go away from you. In this environment, when we are actually billing our customers and supplying the product, where competitors have very long lead times, the companies who are designing with us and they are favoring us, they are actually making even a stronger commitment to us going forward. Forget about going back to the other competitors, they will keep on giving us subsequent designs, because they have seen cycle after cycle, Microchip with investment in inventory and short lead times, continuously gaining share is providing them the right product, right functionality at the right price and at the right lead times.
Harsh Kumar – Morgan Keegan & Co.: And another one for you. Microcontrollers did very well. Is there any particular area, Steve, such as low power or touch that just stood out? Or was it just really broad-based?
Steve Sanghi: Well, it is very, very broad-based, but I did highlight many of the focus areas in the last three years, where we have introduced 400 new products in the last three years. And many of these products have been in the area of extreme low power, where I believe our portfolio is about 60 or 70 products now. Touch sense, which is really on five. We are gaining touch sense designs everywhere, USB interface, advanced graphics, high-performance analog, Ethernet connectivity, RF motor control and digital power supply. Some of these are highlighted and there are many, many more.
Operator: And our next question will come from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Craig Ellis – Caris & Company: Yes, thank you. It looks like the analog business has been outgrowing the microcontroller business for the last couple of quarters. To what do you attribute that and would you expect it to continue as we look into 2010?
Ganesh Moorthy: You know, analog attaches to much more than just our microcontrollers and much more than just microcontrollers in general. So, as we have grown the portfolio of products, we have a much richer portfolio of customers to pick from. We had further reach than what we had previously, and we expect continuing growth in the analog business in the coming quarters.
Craig Ellis – Caris & Company: Thanks, Ganesh. And then on the 32-bit business, you had very nice growth, 44% quarter-on-quarter. When can we expect that that business would start to be a material part of revenues for the company?
Ganesh Moorthy: You know, at the rate that it is going I expect somewhere here in the next 12 months it will get to that point. I mean, as it grows at those kind of high double-digit rates it becomes a larger number every quarter.
Steve Sanghi: I would add that 32-bit designs take about two, two and a half years to get to production. So they are really on the higher end, and our products have been in production less than two years. So, what you are – the ramp you are seeing right now is still from early stage design, preintroduction alpha sites and beta sites and things like that. So the real major customer ramp, where we have significant high-volume designs is really still around the corner.
Craig Ellis – Caris & Company: And so that would be later this year and into next year, Steve?
Steve Sanghi: That is right. Like Ganesh said, in the next 12 months you will see significant up-tick on those designs going to production.
Craig Ellis – Caris & Company: Thanks. Nice job, guys.
Operator: And our next question will come from the side of Chris Danely with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Chris Danely – JP Morgan: Hi, thanks guys. If you guys end up hitting your revenue plan for this year, can you just remind us of when you'll start to need to add extra capacity, and when your utilization rates max out, in terms of quarterly revenue?
Steve Sanghi: Well, again we don't break the utilization, like I said earlier, but we are continuously incrementally adding fab capacity, bottlenecks here and there. The mix today of the products and the technologies is different than the mix we had two years ago when we were at the prior peak. You know, that is why the utilization plays funny games, and you guys get the wrong extrapolation, because over two years as you come back to the same peak revenue, things are different and they are different processes and more advanced processes. So we are continuously, incrementally and slowly adding to the capacity to provide the product for our customers at very, very short lead times. So in this coming year as the business continues to grow, we will be incrementally adding capital in the range that you know, you have seen in the low capital for Microchip over the years.
Eric Bjornholt: I guess just one additional comment on that for everybody on the call, is we have a lot of floor space to grow into in the fab and our assembly and test operations. So it is really just equipment, and we have tried to take advantage of low cost opportunities in the marketplace during this downturn.
Chris Danely – JP Morgan: Oh, and Eric, just to follow on, so for fiscal '11, would we expect the same CapEx to sales type of range?
Eric Bjornholt: You know, if you go back and look at our history, and good years, I would say CapEx is in the $70 million range. We haven't put together a forecast yet. But I mean it will probably be plus or minus $10 million to that.
Chris Danely – JP Morgan: Perfect. And then for my follow-up, you guys commented that a lot of your competitors' lead-times have stretched out. Steve or Ganesh, have you guys seen any increase in your own lead-times?
Ganesh Moorthy: The increase in 80%, 90% of our products are still available in a fairly relatively short lead time. You always have exceptions, where it is a special package or a given dye where a large demand came in, and those exceptions are a little more than usual now than there were nine months ago, but Microchip’s lead times are really still pretty – you know best in the industry.
Chris Danely – JP Morgan: Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: Okay. What I would like to do operator now this go to the next section, where we will talk about SST. First we will make some prepared remarks and after that we will reopen it up for questions, and we will take questions regarding SST. In the second section, you can also add any other remaining questions somebody may have regarding the earnings call.
Steve Sanghi: Okay. As most of you are aware by now, earlier today we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Silicon Storage Technology, Incorporated, who are otherwise known as SST. We are excited by this acquisition, and we would now like to give you a brief overview of who SST is, why we decided to acquire them, how we plan to handle the financial reporting for the various SST businesses and then summarize the overall transaction. So let us start with an overview of who SST is. SST is a global leader in embedded flash technology and the licensing of these technologies. SST also has several other businesses nested within the company, including serial, parallel and specialty flash memories, 8051 microcontrollers and NAND controllers, NAND drives that provide solid state storage, power amplifiers and low noise amplifiers for WiFi applications. SST is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, and it has 574 employees worldwide. SST has approximately $180 million in cash and liquid trading securities on their balance sheet and no debt. We see a compelling strategic rationale to acquire SST for the following reasons. First, their proprietary SuperFlash technology is a critical building block technology for advanced microcontrollers. For example, this super flash technology is licensed by most major foundries and microcontroller OEMs. This acquisition secures critical embedded flash technology for Microchip’s core microcontroller business, and it also enables us to get earlier access to advanced technologies versus waiting until they are in production at the foundries. This acquisition also give us the ability to customize technology variance that would give us an advantage over competing technologies. Second, SST adds a strong patent portfolio to Microchip’s intellectual portfolio. SST has over 360 granted patterns and over 180 patents that are pending. And third, we would add 1851 microcontrollers and NAND controllers to our microcontroller portfolio. NAND controllers essentially are specialized microcontrollers for a given application. Now let us move to the financial reporting plan. The licensing business, 1851 microcontrollers and NAND controllers will be consolidated into Microchip’s financial reporting and continuing operations. We plan to continue investing in SuperFlash technology, consistent with enabling our technology needs and growing the licensing business. We plan to rationalize the serial, parallel and specialty flash memory businesses consistent with supporting and growing the licensing business and emulating microchip high margins serial EEPROM business model. We will treat the memory business as an asset held for sale until the rationalizing is complete. And we plan to divest the NAND drive and WiFi amplifier businesses and will hold them as assets held for sale. Finally let me provide you with a transaction summary. The $2.85 per share acquisition price translates to a transaction value of $275 million. However, once you account for exit fees, $180 million in cash and liquid trading securities in net transaction value is approximately $95 million. We expect the blended non-GAAP operating margins to be excellent after we complete the plant divestitures and rationalize the memory business. We expect the transaction to be accretive on a non-GAAP basis in the first full quarter after the transaction closes, and we expect to close the transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2010. The presentation with the key points we have reviewed with you today will be available from our website after this conference call, and with that we will be happy to take your questions about the SST acquisition.
Eric Bjornholt: Operator, you can reopen the lines for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And our first question comes from the side of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead
James Schneider – Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I guess, broader on the capital allocation front, this is, I believe, the fifth acquisition you've made in the last 18 months or so. Could you just comment on your broader strategy for capital allocation? Whether you have more of a desire to do acquisitions right now as a use of cash rather than dividend increases, which have been a little more measured of late?
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know, our dividend is still one of the highest in the industry, and you know as analysts you guys should make up your mind. You know, we have heard people say that the dividend was too high just two or three quarters ago, when for a very short period of time, we could not cover the dividend during the global financial crisis, and saying why you are paying such a high dividend, others said the dividend would be cut. We were the one company that didn't cut it, maintained the dividend and now we're slowly growing it again, still keeping it at industry high. And you know, yes, in the last 18 months we have done five acquisitions, but most of them have been quite small. This is the largest acquisition, which will use about $95 million to $100 million. Many others have been really single-digit, low single-digits kind of numbers. So our strategy with these acquisitions is elbow out. With each and every acquisition, we are slowly and steadily, you know, elbowing out to the adjacent you know, sockets around the microcontroller or helping add to our microcontroller whether it adds, you know, WiFi capability to a microcontroller with 0G [ph], whether it added touch screens with the Hampshire acquisition, whether it gave us the world-class C compilers with the software acquisition we did, and in this particular case, the SuperFlash technology you know, nearly 4 billion plus microcontrollers a year are built on SST flash technology. Majority of our competitors and major foundries have licensed that technology. So we believe that that technology in our hands will have significant advantage to get advanced leading access to that. So hopefully that addresses your question.
James Schneider – Goldman Sachs: Yes, and then if I might – that's very helpful. And then maybe if I could ask a follow-up, specifically on SST. If you look at the designs that are in the marketplace out there, how often does your microcontrollers appear alongside SST memory products and designs? And do you expect you could also get some additional cross-sell opportunities in addition to the advantage you mentioned before?
Steve Sanghi: The SST memory products are not at all competitive with the memory business we have. We make a serial EE memory, which is very, very low density, you know, 1K memory to 1 Mb memory. SST's products are more in the area of you know, either they are serial flash or parallel flash. So there are really relatively different market. We have not seen these products very much around our microcontroller, although when you get into large customers, you know, large blue-chip customers they use everything and we will find some opportunities, but our goal with the SST business in the memory is not necessarily to ship more of those memory products around our microcontrollers, but to actually rationalize the large memory business, so it makes high profits like our serial memory business.
James Schneider – Goldman Sachs: Understood. Thanks very much.
Operator: And our next question will come from the side of Doug Freedman with Broadpoint. Your line is open.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint AmTech: Great, thank you and congratulations, guys, on a solid quarter and interesting acquisition here. If you could go into details about what – you know, forgive me for not knowing more about SSTI's business, but what percentage of SSTI's sales will you keep and what percentage of them are being held for sale?
Steve Sanghi: I think it's a detailed question that we don't have a precise answer today. You know, this acquisition is supposed to close I think in early April approximately. So we have the next two months to completely figure that out. So as we are closing this acquisition, we'll hold another conference call and give you a guidance, on really, you know, how the total sales and model would look like. Right now you can basically assume that you know, Microchip is not going to jeopardize its continuing gross and operating margin business that we have today. So the businesses we will keep above the line would really meet Microchip’s metrics.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint AmTech: All right. Very good. I think I'll accept that as a complete answer. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the side of Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Brendan Furlong – Miller Tabak: Hi, how are you doing gentlemen? Good morning. Thank you. Actually my question was on the quarter, but I'll take a pass on that. On SSTI, my – again, like the previous caller, you'd have to forgive my lack of knowledge on it – but they appear to be predominantly, like, 80% or so exposed like consumer PC, handsets – is that the case, and is that what you're going to target in the future?
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh, you want to take that.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yes. I think the answer is yes. They have a high exposure into the consumer segment and into the PC segment. As Steve mentioned, I think what we want to understand is how we can find the aspects of the business that have margin characteristics that we would like and that's really where we would focus our energies on.
Steve Sanghi: Let me expand on it. You know, take the microcontroller touch business, our competitors focus on handsets. We have a large touch business with 500 customers in production largely outside the handsets making very high margins. Serial EE business, most of our competitors take the low margin businesses in PC consumer whatever. We have a highly profitable good margin serial EE business. So this is the Microchip’s strength and skill, where we know how to draw the diamond out of the rough, and that's what we've got to do with this business.
Brendan Furlong – Miller Tabak: I understand. Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi: Yes, thanks.
Operator: And our next question will come from the side of Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan. Your line is open.
Harsh Kumar – Morgan Keegan & Co.: Hi, guys, I'm also not very familiar with SSTI. Are you a customer of the licensing technology of SuperFlash from them? And also in the future, as you complete the acquisition, would you let your competitors use that technology? If you can answer that.
Steve Sanghi: I can answer that. So Microchip uses SST technology in many of our products that we develop at the foundries. Microchip had not directly licensed the SST technology for use in our fabs, but we were in negotiations to do so and this way we just own it, we don't have to license it.
Harsh Kumar – Morgan Keegan & Co.: And would you let your competitors use it in the future?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, we will keep the licensing business as a stand-alone element business, where their goal would be to really grow the licensing business and license the rest of the foundries and take the advanced technologies and many of our, you know, hard-core competitors in microcontrollers are using SST flash technology, and we will not limit their access to that technology to keep the licensing business pure. It's very high margin makes, you know, 100% gross margin in licensing business. So the goal is – that is the core business in this company and we will help grow it. We have plenty of other avenues to compete with our competitors. We beat them in architecture, we beat them in design, we beat them on cost, we beat them on service, we beat them on design wins. We don't need to limit their access to technology. We will not do that.
Harsh Kumar – Morgan Keegan & Co.: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from the side of Uche Orji with UBS. Your line is open.
Uche Orji – UBS: Thank you very much. Steve, let me just start out by asking you, are you – from an investor's standpoint, you are now, quite frankly, diverse that is defining [ph] to a memory business.
Steve Sanghi: And what?
Uche Orji – UBS: Into a memory business. And fine, it's a product that collaborates with the microcontroller, but it's still a memory business. How – what do you think you can do with this business such that investors do not as awarded [ph] by a multiple, you know, given that you know, in typical memory business, you have all the issues about volatility. In the line business model, you have issues about margin structure. So I know you say it's going to meet the Microchip metrics, but you know, any more ways you can assure us that this will not bring a multiple depressing attributes to your business? That's just something I want to –
Steve Sanghi: Uche, you know, we signed this deal at midnight and you know, in answering those kind of questions you know, there are employees involved, there are customers involved, there are partners involved, and I think you have to be bit more patient, you know, as we develop the integration plans, and more precisely can tell you what goes into the continuing business and what falls below. We've given you some indication. Microchip has been in the memory business for 20 years. We never lost money. You know, we are the most consistent high margin profitable business memory and non-memory. So we know how to do it. So, you know, be patient and give us some credit and if you don't, then so be it.
Uche Orji – UBS: Definitely. We will be. Just one more question, Steve. In terms of technically understanding what SuperFlash really brings, is this really more about high density, lower power embedded flash? And I just wanted to, if you can, you know, give us a little bit more insight as to how this product technically stands up against your basic floating gates [ph] non-flash products used by other people, that's just something –
Steve Sanghi: That's a good question. SST’s flash is a much smaller cell size on a given technology than these flash we run internally. Now the flash we run inside is significantly more reliable. We are one of the only competitors, I believe. There may be always others. Whenever we say only, there is a risk of being wrong. Our internal flash doesn't require error correction to go into even the most complex in the liability sensitive applications like automotive. Some of the SST flash applications in automotive, for example, requires an error correction mechanism. So our internal technology leads in reliability, leads in you know, excellent reliability, low power and other stuff. So we address the market inside with our products, which have those characteristics. There are from lower density products, they are from low-power products and other things. Now the microcontroller market is very, very diverse. Everybody doesn't need low power or everybody doesn't need low density, some need high-density but they also need reliability. So SST flash, there are probably more microcontrollers in the world shipped on SST flash than probably on any other technology, probably we can safely say that. So you know, having that in our hands, giving us early access to that technology being able to use it inside as well as at foundries, and being able to create variance of that technology for our own competitive advantage. I think this is a significant benefit for our long term microcontroller business.
Uche Orji – UBS: Perfect.
Ganesh Moorthy: If I would add to that, you know, as we push up and out in terms of the microcontroller market, we continue to add larger microcontroller products, more complex microcontroller products, and have larger amounts of memory. SuperFlash will become an increasing part of how those products get deployed, and the strength of our internal technologies remains a strength for you know, the large percentage of our smaller to medium sized microcontrollers.
Uche Orji – UBS: Great. Thank you very much, guys. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: And our next question will come from the side of John Barton with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
John Barton – Cowen & Company: Thanks, Steve. To kind of follow-up on the last question, and my recollection may be wrong but as I remember it, SST's SuperFlash, one of the biggest advantages for embedded arrays was that the manufacturing steps were the most close to a standard seamless process as compared to other flash technologies. Am I remembering that correctly or not?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I haven't heard any competitors say that their technology is not simple additions to the standard CMOS. I think that's cliché. You know, we can say that about our technology, and I've seen other people's literature say that too. So I honestly haven’t studied it enough to really agree or disagree with that claim. I probably have to look into that.
John Barton – Cowen & Company: Okay. And then just one other question, if you could kind of characterize the personality of the merger, if I could call it that – and again, I haven't been watching SST closely, but I believe they were put in play by a private equity buyout. I mean to some extent, I find it interesting that Bing Yeh, the CEO, isn't on this call today or – you know, how do we see it? Is it an acquisition of IP and core engineers? Or how do you think the structure will look post-acquisition?
Steve Sanghi: We have answered an earlier question, I think when people are involved, the personnel are involved, you know, officers are involved, you know, it's just way too early of having signed this deal you know, midnight. We need to you know, sit down and build an integration plan and get into the next detail of you know, products and roadmaps and design pipeline and others, and it's too early to kind of give you any kind of guidance. You know, it will take about two months to close the acquisitions. So by the time we close this acquisition, we should be able to give you pretty good indication of really where we're looking at.
John Barton – Cowen & Company: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from the side of Jung Hwang [ph] with Millennium Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jung Hwang with Millennium Partners, your line is open.
Jung Hwang – Millennium Partners: Yes. Hi, congratulations on the transaction and thanks for taking my question. Just curious whether you have a voting agreement in place with Mr. Yeh?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think it is public information that Mr. Yeh had a voting agreement with Technology Resource Holding, which had the first deal the private equity firm, and then he had a second voting agreement in place that is the Technology Resource Holding deal gets terminated, and I think he committed his voting agreement to Cerberus [ph], right. So that is in the public domain. So –
Jung Hwang – Millennium Partners: But you wouldn't disclose whether that has changed to you as a counterparty – in terms of – do you have an agreement with him? I mean, he does own a lot of shares. So we're just curious.
Steve Sanghi: Yes, there is nothing I can say. I don't know if anything else is in the public domain.
Jung Hwang – Millennium Partners: Okay. And just one follow-up question, what's the breakup fee in your transaction here? Is that standard 2%, 3% of equity value?
Steve Sanghi: The breakup fee in our definitive agreement that will be filed today, right.
Jung Hwang – Millennium Partners: Okay.
Steve Sanghi: So SST will file it today. So what's the breakup fee?
Unidentified Participant: 3.5%.
Steve Sanghi: 3.5%.
Jung Hwang – Millennium Partners: Okay. Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi: I don't want the breakup fee. I want the acquisition to complete.
Operator: And we will take our next question from the side of Chris Danely with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Chris Danely – JP Morgan: Hi, thanks guys. It might be a little early to answer this question but, Steve, as I understand, I think SST is entirely fabless. Would you plan to migrate all of this in-house or keep it fabless?
Steve Sanghi: You're correct that SST is a fabless company. We will not be migrating SST's products into our fabs. Obviously, their core business is a licensing business. Beyond that they have a large memory business that we have spoken about. Most of that memory business is at technologies and lithographies [ph], that we're not capable of running enough in our fabs, because you know, those are way to you know, muzelar [ph] driven. So they run at the foundries, and we will continue to run them at the foundries, and then they have some other businesses, they have a small microcontroller business, 1851, a small NAND controller business and others. They're all running at foundries and there are just probably not enough economies to bring them inside.
Chris Danely – JP Morgan: Sure. And then is this technology – is this something that you will be injecting into your current PIC/dsPIC line of products? Or will you be creating a whole new line of products?
Steve Sanghi: So many of the PIC/dsPICs and our 32-bit products already use the SST technology. So this would simply give us an additional opportunity to create variance to even expand our product portfolio to take advantage of those technologies even more ways. So you know, foundries give you a standard technology. So it's really hard to get a variant out of that, and Microchip's competitive differentiation and high margins and all that run by, you know, we travel where other people don't.
Chris Danely – JP Morgan: Yes, I guess – will this mean the introduction of an entirely new product line? Or we see new PIC 14, 16, 18 new dsPIC product lines, I guess?
Steve Sanghi: The architectures will be the same. We just build around the existing architectures.
Chris Danely – JP Morgan: Yes, I got it. That was my question. And then from my last question, you know, I'm just glancing at their financials. And it seems like you're probably going to have to just grab maybe two-thirds, three-fourths of their products to get this thing accretive. I'm just wondering why do you guide, if you're going to get rid of over half the business?
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know, two-third of the business is memory, and you know, I think they break that out in the Q, right. I want to say something that won't break it out. So, you know, a large portion of their business is memory, which is very low gross margin business, but there are portions of that business that we can extract that into our business model, a very serial EE type of very high profitable good margin business model, and that's where we need to get to from where we are.
Chris Danely – JP Morgan: Have to you talked to anybody else about potentially buying this thing?
Steve Sanghi: We've been talking to ourselves all this time.
Chris Danely – JP Morgan: Okay. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: It is a deal. So, you know, we were not allowed to talk to anybody, you know, prior to the deal being public.
Chris Danely – JP Morgan: No, that – Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And we will take our next question from the side of Tim Mahon with Gartner Invest. Your line is open.
Tim Mahon – Gartner Invest: Thanks. Hey, Steve, just real quickly on the last 12 months, if you take a look at the technology and licensing line at SST. Do you have any sense what the breakout is between the actual technology licensing and the royalties?
Steve Sanghi: No, we don't break that out and SST does not break that out either.
Tim Mahon – Gartner Invest: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from the side of Sumit Dhanda with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Eric Ghernati – Merrill Lynch: Yes. Hi, this is Eric Ghernati for Sumit. Thanks for taking my question. Just said that you've – Steve, you have voiced your desire to grow SST's licensing business going forward. And if I look at their financials, their licensing business is down around like 22% from the peak in 2008, and has not grown since 2005, but it's currently at a quarterly run rate of $9.5 million. I guess my question is, how do you believe you're going to go by growing this business, especially when some of the licensees include some of your competitors – Freescale, just to name one? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know, I'm not setting up the numbers that you may be setting, but –
Eric Bjornholt: That's the licensing revenue in calendar Q3, last reported numbers.
Steve Sanghi: Yes, so last reported number were $9.5 million licensing business in calendar quarter third. You know, the entire industry was down last year. So if you're comparing anybody's numbers of their last quarter, which was a public quarter was September quarter, you know, that number about a year ago would be down because all microcontroller manufacturers were down year-over-year. The entire industry was down year-over-year. So the numbers would be down.
Eric Ghernati – Merrill Lynch: Yes, but it's also flattish from 2006 and 2007?
Eric Bjornholt: You know, if we did not understand some of this, you know, this was part of our diligence. We understand how that business has been constructed, what its characteristics are and we have confidence in its ability to grow.
Steve Sanghi: There is a very large design pipeline. Remember these are advanced products. You know, any advanced products that are 2, 2.5 years to production. So there is a very rich pipeline of foundries and our competitors who have licensed these technologies have introduced products, which are going through the incubation period and there is a significant ramp coming ahead.
Eric Ghernati – Merrill Lynch: Can you give us a little more granularity on what you just talked about, specifically which product lines, which segments are going to benefit from the –
Steve Sanghi: That business, I can't disclose elements of the business yet. I mean they are announcing their results tomorrow. You can get on, you know, talk to them. We will be able to talk to you in a couple of months when it's our business, but, you know, we can't give you those details.
Eric Ghernati – Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from the side of Craig Ellis with Caris & Company. Your line is open.
Craig Ellis – Caris & Company: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to see if there was any further color you could provide around the sources of accretion in the first full quarter after the deal, whether it's the saving of public company costs or any other items?
Steve Sanghi: It's a large number of things, and again I can't break it out right now. It's too early. I think we need you know, after the dust settles, we need to come back with some more information for our investors. Meanwhile, this has no impact on the March quarter. So our March quarter guidance that we gave you would be clean March quarter of Microchip. We expect to close this deal in early April. So this is a June quarter number and by the time we get there, we'll give you a clean guidance of what will roll up above the operating line, you know, on a non-GAAP basis and then what will be held for sale or what would be below, and so we'll give you very good guidance.
Craig Ellis – Caris & Company: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from the side of Eric Gettleman with Chesapeake Partners. Your line is open.
Eric Gettleman – Chesapeake Partners: Hi, thank you and good morning. Congratulations on the quarter and the acquisition. I had two quick questions for you. The first question was relating to the press releases from this morning on the acquisition itself. One thing that was noticeably absent, given the background of the transaction with SST, in terms of being private equity and part management buyout, was that in the release, it did say that it was approved by both Boards, but it was unanimously recommended by the Independent Strategic Committee – which would lead me to believe that management itself was actually not onboard. And I was wondering if that's a fair interpretation.
Steve Sanghi: I have no idea. You should call them and ask them. I was not there.
Eric Gettleman – Chesapeake Partners: Fair enough, although usually, in a press release like that I would assume that you would know if it was unanimous by the Board of Directors of the company?
Steve Sanghi: It was unanimous by the Board of Directors of the company.
Eric Gettleman – Chesapeake Partners: Okay. And then the second question I had was just regarding – obviously, there was a dissenting group in the original transaction. And I'm wondering if you've had contact with them to make sure if they're actually onboard with the transaction in this range?
Steve Sanghi: We have not contacted them for obvious reasons prior to this morning. Our name was not known by anybody that we were even one of the party biddings, and no, we have not spoken with anybody.
Eric Gettleman – Chesapeake Partners: Congratulations on the quarter and the acquisition, and thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question will come from the side of Romit Shah with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Romit Shah, your line is open.
Steve Sanghi: Looks like he's gone. Take the next one.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. So I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for additional comments.
Steve Sanghi: Okay, I want to thank everybody for joining the call. We did have some problems starting on our website, IR page wasn't working. It got working five minutes into the call. So if anybody just kind of went away because they couldn't get on, they can listen to the replay. Microchip management would be at Thomas Weisel conference next Tuesday, so we'll take more questions there, and we'll continue the discussion at that time. Thank you very much.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at any time. Thank you and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip Technology's second quarter and fiscal year 2010 financial results conference call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution you that such statements or predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
 :
 : Net sales for the September quarter were $226.7 million, up approximately 17.5% from net sales of $192.9 million in the immediately preceding quarter. On a geographic basis, revenue in the Americas was up 13% in the September quarter, Europe was up 10% and Asia was up 23.8%. Revenue in all geographies exceeded the expectations we had entering the quarter. Europe was exceptionally strong in what is typically a down quarter for that region. Asia continues to be our largest geographic region, representing 51.3% of sales in the September quarter. The Americas were 24.7% of sales, and Europe was 24% of sales. These measurements are based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes for our customers. That does not necessarily represent where the design activity is taking place or where the end product consumption is occurring. We are continuing to include information on our press release on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on our Investor Relations page of our Web site at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $53.2 million or $0.29 per diluted share, an increase of 51.9% from non-GAAP net income of $35 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter. The after-tax impact on the September 2009 quarterly earnings that have been excluded from our non-GAAP results, include $8.3 million in share-based compensation expense, $1.3 million in gains from trading securities, $1 million in non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, and $0.7 million in charges associated with our acquisition activities. GAAP net income was $44.5 million in the September quarter or $0.24 per diluted share. I would like to highlight that during the September quarter, Microchip liquidated its holdings of trading securities and at this time we do not anticipate there will be any mark-to-market adjustments from trading securities in the December quarter. I will now go through some of the operating results for the September quarter. I will be referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis, prior to the effects of share-based compensation and acquisition related expenses. Gross margins were 55.5% in the September quarter compared to 51.4% in the June quarter. The quarterly increase in gross profit margin was driven by a variety of factors including higher production activity in our factories and continued cost reduction efforts from our global manufacturing operations. With the increase in revenue, we were able to achieve operating leverage from the business, with total operating expenses of 27.7% of sales in the September quarter compared to 29.2% in the prior quarter. Research and Development costs were $26.5 million, representing 11.7% of sales. Sales and general administrative expenses were $36.3 million, representing 16% of sales. Operating expenses continue to be managed appropriately based on the overall economic environment. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition related expenses were 54.4%. Total operating expenses were $70.6 million or 31.1% of sales and include share-based compensation of $7.6 million and acquisition related expenses of $0.3 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the tax rate for the September quarter was 13%. The GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was 13.3%. The difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate was driven from the higher tax rate that apply to the gains on trading securities and a non-cash interest expense on our convertible debt. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax advantage securities. The dividend declared today of $0.34 per share will be paid on December 2, 2009 to shareholders of record on November 18, 2009. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $62.3 million. Moving on to the balance sheet, Microchip's inventory balance at September 30, 2009 was $108.5 million, representing approximately 96 days of inventory. Inventory on Microchip's balance sheet was reduced by $5.4 million or 12 days and the days of inventory at our distributors were flat to the prior quarter. At the end of September, the combined inventory on Microchip's balance sheet and at its distributors was 131 days, which is the lowest level we have experienced in more than seven years. Therefore, we are aggressively increasing our manufacturing output so our inventory balances can continue to meet the needs of our customers. We expect inventory days on our balance sheet to grow in the December quarter by approximately six days to 12 days. The increases in our production output will have ongoing positive impact on Microchip's gross margin percentage. At September 30, our receivables were $106.7 million, an increase of $8.6 million or 8.8% from the balance as of the end of June. Receivable balances are in great condition with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. Over the past year we have not had any significant bad debt write-offs in our business. We continue to closely monitor customer activity to ensure we are protecting the receivable assets on our balance sheet. As of September 30th, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1.473 billion. Our cash generation from the business was $96.6 million, prior to the payment of $62.1 million dividend. Our cash generation continues to be strong, and our total cash and investment position is projected to grow again in the December 2009 quarter. Capital spending was approximately $6 million for the September quarter, and our fiscal 2010 capital expenditure forecast is currently $35 million. We are investing on equipment to support the revenue growth of our new products and technologies, and are also taking advantage of low cost equipment opportunities in the marketplace, that will position us well for future growth. Depreciation expense for the September quarter was $21.7 million, which is equal to what depreciation expense was in the June quarter.
 :
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now comment on the individual product lines. All three of our product lines, Microcontrollers, Analog and Serial EEPROMs delivered outstanding growth in the September quarter. We are seeing the results of our strategy to stay invested in our new product development and demand creation resources during the global recession. By employing a shared sacrifice of pay cuts instead of resorting to mass layoffs like many of our competitors did, we believe, we are seeing the leading edge of differentiated revenue growth and operating profit results. Let's now take a closer look at each of our product lines, starting with Microcontrollers. Our Microcontroller business delivered superb results and was up a strong 16.6% on a sequential basis. Flash Microcontrollers represented approximately 80.9% of our Microcontroller business in the September quarter. Our 8-bit Microcontroller business had another excellent quarter as all segments of our 8-bit product line experienced very strong growth. Our 16-bit microcontroller business achieved another record for quarterly revenue with very strong sequential growth of 49.1% as well as 70.3% growth from the year-ago quarter. New customers and new designs going to production continue to help drive growth as a number of volume 16-bit customers grew by 208 customers to 2,050. Our 32-bit microcontroller product line meanwhile continues to make good progress with 56% sequential growth, albeit on a small revenue base and well over 100 customers who are now involved in production. Moving to development tools, we had another record quarter with 38,086 development tools shipped in the September quarter. Development tools sales are an excellent leading indicator of continued strong design in activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers and should bode well for future growth. Now moving to our analog business, here too, we delivered outstanding results with very strong sequential growth of 25.5%. As a result, our analog business in the September quarter was over 10% of Microchip's revenue for the first time ever. Growth was especially strong in the linear, mixed signal, interface and safety and security product lines. We are very pleased with the design win and revenue momentum our analog business has shown. We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new products that we expect will continue to contribute strong revenue growth in the coming quarters. Now moving to Serial E-square [ph] products, this business was up 16.8% sequentially. We were pleased to see solid growth in this area of our embedded control products. We continue to run this business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. At a time when many of our competitors have significantly pushed out their lead times to between 14 weeks and 26 weeks, Microchip's investment in inventory, flexible rotating time off in our factories during the recession and ongoing operational excellence has enabled us to maintain our industry leading lead times of roughly four weeks to six weeks or approximately 90% of our line items. In the current environment this is translating to a further growth in our market share as we are better able to respond to rapidly rising customer demand and capitalize on competitors inability to supply product as well as to instill confidence in customers as to who they should commit new designs to, so that they're assured a future supply. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments as well as our guidance for the December quarter. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the September quarter then I will talk about our guidance for December 2009 quarter and also discuss our internal plan for calendar year 2010. Reflecting on the September quarter, I want to thank the entire Microchip team for delivering a flawless quarter in every respect. We beat the upper end of our revised revenue guidance by a significant margin, achieving a 17.5% sequential growth, marking our strongest sequential quarter, growth quarter in over 15 years. We also beat the upper end of our gross margin guidance. We continued to deliver solid improvements in operating expense, executing on our plan to deliver incremental leverage in this area of our business. And on earnings per share, we beat the upper end of our guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis by $0.02 per share. Our GAAP EPS grew by over 60% sequentially and our non-GAAP EPS grew by over 50% sequentially. We have been profitable for 76 consecutive quarters, and the December quarter will be our 77th quarter. Our inventory dropped sequentially by 12 days to 96 days. We begin to grow factory output aggressively in the September quarter and will continue to do so in the current quarter. We generated $96.6 million in free cash flow, prior to paying our industry high dividend. After paying the dividend, we added $34.6 million in cash to our treasury. We also resumed nudging the dividend up on a quarterly basis, as you saw in our press release today. I would also like to add that we have now returned over $1 billion to the shareholders in the form of dividend since we began paying dividends over six years ago. And that has to be a very significant return for our long-term shareholders. From a geographical standpoint, as Eric discussed, we achieved substantial sequential growth in all major geographies of the world, and on product lines the story was impressive too.
 : I also wanted to highlight the comparison to SIA numbers that were recently released. While Microchip does not participate in SIA and short-term SIA numbers are often suspect, many of the investors and analysts follow those numbers. Based on SIA data from December '08 to September '09, SIA's eight plus 16-bit Microcontrollers were up 1.1%, essentially flat. During the same time period of December '08 to September '09, Microchip's eight plus 16-bit Microcontrollers were up 18%, showing significant market share gain. Microchip has maintained its record share of 8-bit Microcontrollers and we are steadily gaining market share in 16-bit, achieving our highest market share ever on 16-bit Microcontrollers with record sales in the September quarter. Now, I will discuss our guidance for the December quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio for September quarter was 1.15. And our starting backlog for the December quarter was significantly higher than our starting backlog for the September quarter. So the visibility is improving significantly. The bookings rate so far in the quarter has been very strong. On the other hand, due to holidays, December has fewer shipping days in Europe and the US than any other third month of the quarter. So considering all that, we expect our net sales for the December quarter to be up between 4% and 8% sequentially, which is certainly above what normal seasonality is for our business. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57% and 57.5%, which is 150 basis points to 200 basis points improvement over the September quarter and we expect our GAAP gross margin to be between 56.2% and 56.7%, which is 180 basis points to 230 basis points improvement over the September quarter. Regarding earnings per share for the December quarter, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.33 and $0.35 and we expect GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.27 and $0.29. Now, I would like to discuss the longer-term outlook for calendar year '10. We continue to see significant opportunities in our strategic product lines. From a competitive standpoint, our product line is one of the strongest in the industry. With the broadest coverage from low end 8-bit to high end 32-bit, from lowest power XLP product line to high performance MCUs and with the broadest set of peripherals in touch sense, motor control, digital power supplies, connectivity, analog and RF, our microcontroller product line continues to be the compelling solution for the market. In addition, many of our innovative analog products are very well-positioned and gaining market share. We have significantly broadened our served available market and our multi-year demand creation efforts have yielded a very large number of design wins outside of our traditional core group of customers and applications. Based on our confidence in the business, we want to share our strong outlook with our investors and the financial community. We expect our business to continue to outperform the industry, led by a 16-bit and 32-bit opportunity, continued growth of our 8-bit business, and the leverage in our operating model. The opportunity in our analog business is also another important catalyst for incremental growth and continued market share gains. Our PIC32 which is our 32-bit microcontroller and our DS PIC are successfully competing with arm-based controllers and gaining shares steadily as evidenced by the design wins we have in the pipeline and the early revenue gains. One way to further amplify our confidence in our growth prospects would be to disclose to the Street, our significant design wins by customer, our focus areas, and our competitive differentiation. But we continue to believe that part of the secret to our success is not disclosing these factors that can lead to loss of our competitive position. Reflecting our expectations, we are taking the unusual step in providing you our calendar year '10 internal plan which reflects our understanding of the opportunities that we see. So all the numbers that I'm about to share are from our internal plan for calendar year '10. Calendar year '10 revenue of $1.05 billion, which would be another record year for Microchip in revenue, up about 26% from calendar year '09. Non-GAAP gross margin of 58.5% for calendar year '10, and GAAP gross margin of 57.7% for the year. Non-GAAP operating expense of 26.7% for calendar year '10 and GAAP operating expense of 29.6% for the year. Non-GAAP operating profit of 31.8% for calendar year '10 and GAAP operating profit of 28.1% for the year. And finally, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.50 for calendar year '10 and GAAP earnings per share of $1.29 for the year. These EPS numbers are about 12% above the average of Wall Street research, and up to 26% higher than some research, hence prompting us to share our internal plan and outlook with you. I want to take this opportunity to thank our customers, investors, analysts and employees for their support through this very difficult period and assure them that their support is never taken for granted. With that, Cynthia, would you please poll for questions?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) And our first question will come from JoAnne Feeney with FTN.
Steve Sanghi: Go ahead, Joann.
JoAnne Feeney – FTN: I was hoping you could perhaps elaborate a little bit on the prices in the industry where you think you're gaining share in 16-bit. I realize you don't have great detail on your end markets, but perhaps you could let us know if it's similar to the distribution of interest you have in your 8-bit products by, say, is it consumer, industrial, automotive, or is it quite a bit different? Any details you can provide would be very helpful. Thanks a lot.
Ganesh Moorthy: The composition is across a broad range of applications and markets. In that sense it’s similar to how our 8-bit business is. There are obviously certain applications where the 16-bit performance is a requirement that we're able to meet and those are the areas where we're taking some incremental share. But really it's not concentrated anywhere. It's a pretty broad base of areas we're winning our designs.
JoAnne Feeney – FTN: And are you doing the same thing with 32-bit, targeting a broad spectrum or is it more focused?
Ganesh Moorthy: It is, again a broad spectrum of designs that we're going up. We've always been about not trying to find a single market, a single application upon which to hang our hat and while we do see areas that are growing at different rates, it's really across a broad spectrum of applications.
JoAnne Feeney – FTN: Okay. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: We're shipping to 2,000 volume customers on 16-bit. And our over 100 volume customers on 32-bit. So that alone tells you that it's very broad-based.
Operator:
 :
Chris Danely – JPMorgan: Thanks. I know you guys usually comment that whenever we ask you about end markets or regions, it's a very broad base, but given what's happened this year, can you just give us your take on what's so strong in Asia? I would suspect that it's China. And then also if you could comment at all on the automotive market and what you're seeing there?
Steve Sanghi: Last quarter, we saw very broad-based strength around the world. As Eric pointed out, European business was up 10% in the summer quarter where they take the August off, so usually Europe business is down in the quarter. Obviously, from a sequential revenue growth standpoint, China was the strongest, but we grew in the rest of Asia also by very large amount and U.S. was also very up significantly and we grew in all different market segments. Yes, we did very well in automotive because for cash for clunkers and others, but similarly we did very well in consumer, industrial, communication and others.
Chris Danely – JPMorgan: Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji – UBS: Thank you very much. Steve, first of all, thank you very much for providing us the insight for 2010 plans. Let me just try to dissect that a little bit. How much of your 2010 plans will be driven by new products? And within the existing products, what are your assumptions for areas such as automotive and industrial for 2010, so I just kind of understand. Because you're implying I think the mid points for December guidance you're implying a calendar upside of as much as 26% for 2010. So I just like to see if I can break that down between new products and what's happening with existing products, thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Well, Uche, in average, a design cycle for Microchip's microcontroller and analog products are anywhere from nine months to two years plus. We are here in November. I don't think any of our growth next year comes from new products that we don't exist today. It could be a very small number, something we're just introducing in the next month, may create a small amount of revenue in calendar Q4. So all of our next year's revenue largely comes from products that are in production, we've been incubating it for a year to two years, they're design wins and they're really proceeding down the path of going to production.
Uche Orji – UBS: And then, so if you can break down for me your expectation for automotive, industrial and other markets for 2010 in terms of what's driving that internal plan.
Steve Sanghi: I can't even do that for last quarter actual, forget about the next year. Don't have any ability to do that across 63,000 customers, and with 60% of our revenue coming from distributors.
Uche Orji – UBS: Fair enough. Can I ask one more question?
Steve Sanghi: Yes.
Uche Orji – UBS: In terms of your touch product, can you give me an idea how much progress you're making there? And if I look into Q4, they're just so many other people talking about what they're doing in touch and I know you've been very active in this area, so can you talk about your competitive positioning and how you see your products progressing through Q4 and possibly into 2010? Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: So, I think we've given you some color last quarter on the number of customers that were in production and the number that were well along the way in terms of the design in cycle. Those numbers have grown. Since that time obviously some of the customers we were working with have gone to production. So the production numbers have gone up and the number of customers that are working on design wins have also gone up. The progression is on a path that we're happy with. Our touch is differentiated from competitive alternatives in several ways. First of all, we offer customers the ability for them to customize the touch solutions using the software that we provide. Second of all, we provide the lowest power consumption when our products are used in touch solutions as compared to our competitive alternatives. So in portable and power sensitive applications, we have the best power consumption for those touch applications. Thirdly, our touch works across a broad range of our Microcontrollers, so you can pick the microcontroller that is appropriate for what you're trying to do in your applications and add touch to it, which also allows customer to cost reduce without having to have a microcontroller run the application and a separate microcontroller to run touch, which is how many of the competitive alternatives are set up to be. And lastly, we offer a broad range of touch alternatives. We have capacity touch capability, we have inductive touch capability, and we have touch screen capability. So based on the application and the need, we have multiple solutions available for a customer to achieve their objectives with touch in their application.
Uche Orji – UBS: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Moving on to James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider – Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess on the 2010 outlook, put it another way, could you give us a sense of what assumption you use for either microcontroller industry growth or overall semiconductor industry growth in getting to that revenue number?
Steve Sanghi: We don't care about the semiconductor industry growth or the microcontroller growth. Our results are highly differentiated. They have been in the years past and we built this much more driven by the products we have in the market, the design pipeline at the rate of winning and using the metrics that are time tested regarding what portion we win and go to production, and what time frame.
James Schneider – Goldman Sachs: Understand. So, much more bottoms up driven than tops down.
Steve Sanghi: That's right.
James Schneider – Goldman Sachs: And then just a follow-up on the OpEx, if I look at the kind of implied OpEx GAAP dollars run rate, Eric, about $77.5 per quarter for calendar year 2010, how should we think about how that grows from current levels in SG&A versus R&D?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we haven't broken that out specifically, but we're going to make prudent investments in the business that are required to grow it. So I guess the expectation would be is that sales and marketing and R&D would grow at a faster clip than G&A. But other than that, I don't think we can give you a lot of guidance.
James Schneider – Goldman Sachs: Fair enough. Thanks very much.
Eric Bjornholt: Welcome.
Operator: Moving on to Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan.
Harsh Kumar – Morgan Keegan: Hey, guys, first of all, congratulations on a great quarter and great guidance. You guys are clearly doing well.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Harsh Kumar – Morgan Keegan: Steve, as you look back, coming out of this recession, what were one of the two things that you think Microchip did well relative to its competitors? Was it simple case of balance sheet or new products? Anything that you think you guys are better versus your competition?
Steve Sanghi: There are a lot of people in the competition, of course 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, analog competition, so there's a large number of companies and I'm not schooled on what everybody else did in various areas so just guts to talk about what we did well. We deployed a strategy going into a recession where we're here more than a year after the global financial crisis we did not lay off a single person at Microchip anywhere in the world. And yet we gained as much expense reduction on the operating expense line as anybody. We've shown graphs in the past where we were in the top two companies or three companies of having gained the expense reductions, so we did that through lowering a lot of discretionary expenses, our worldwide, all employees were on a pay cut, we zeroed out the bonuses, so we did that through shared cuts and sacrifices rather than doing a lot of layoffs. Now, it has resulted into two advantages. Number one, in terms of employee hours spent, we stayed invested in our R&D pipeline rather than rescheduling a lot of the activities, because we kept everybody employed. And number two, we kept our demand creation effort in the marketplace and a year later as we are recovering out of the recession, we're finding a very rich, new product pipeline that we have put out in the market as well as a very large number of design wins from a significantly larger served available market through all these new products in 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and analog. And in the manufacturing front, what we did was we gave employees rotating time off. So at the height of the recession when the capacity needs were way down, we had fab people will take every third week off unpaid. And then the following week, different one-third will go off unpaid. But everybody stayed certified. Everybody had a job. Everybody knew how to operate the equipment. We didn't layoff people.
 : Short-term, we're getting a lot of pull-in, a lot of new orders where competitors can't supply but longer-term we're also getting new design win sockets, because they're unhappy with the competitors so they want to give the next design to us. When things are equal, we're winning it on the margin.
Harsh Kumar – Morgan Keegan: That's very helpful. And Steve, I know you don't want to get into numbers on this but looking out for 2010, is there any vertical you're more excited about than the other comp, consumer, industrial, auto, any color would be helpful.
Steve Sanghi: I'm excited about all of our opportunities.
Harsh Kumar – Morgan Keegan: Okay. Thanks, Steve.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: Next is Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence Whalen – Citi: Hi, thanks for taking my question. It's related to gross margin. I think you had said in the previous quarter that you thought you would get 100 basis points of gross margin expansion, both in the December and in the March quarter. My question is, do you still have any expectation or visibility into gross margin in March? Are you sticking to your expectation for at least 100 basis point margin expansion in the March quarter? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: I think if you look at the gross margin curve has been pulled in quite substantially. With the upside in revenue, our inventories became too low and all through the quarter we kept increasing our production plan. We have never increased production plans so rapidly, almost every two weeks we were adjusting the numbers as we were seeing the upside. So lot of the gross margin increase has been pulled in and there is more ahead and you can look at the difference between our December guidance to the next year guidance, there is some additional gross margin plus there is a year average, we go out of the year even higher than that. Beyond that, I don't have the granularity. It will just all depend on where we are in our guidance of 4% to 8% for this quarter and this quarter will be the very similar. We'll be changing production plan continuously, as we see any of the upside materializing.
Terence Whalen – Citi: Okay, thanks, and then as the follow-up to that, I think in your $1.05 billion calendar '10 guidance that equates to about $260 million run rate plus or minus. I think in the past when you've been near $260 million per quarter, you have been right at 60% gross margin. Is there any reason not to think that you would achieve the same 60% gross margin on that level of a quarterly run rate of $262 million? Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: I think I can't break it down much further. I mean, it's going to be close. I don't know if it's a little bit this way or that way. We don't expect that we will reach our peak gross margin by the end of calendar year '10. There will still be things happening. Our prior record was I think closer to 270 and the business always comes back in a slightly different mix. So some of the older capacity we have is still growing and still utilization is going up. I would think our gross margin would be rising well into fiscal year '12, most of the calendar year '11. So, I don't really have further granularity on really how close we get to that number.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And our next question will come from Doug Freedman with Broadpoint.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint: Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question and I echo the congratulations on a strong quarter.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint: Can you give us a little bit more detail on how you go into calculating your book-to-bill numbers? I just was wondering what window of time you're looking at there.
Steve Sanghi: Our book-to-bill ratio is total net orders we receive in the quarter, which is gross bookings minus any cancellations, minus any returns. So net bookings, divide that by the net revenue.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint: Your booking window, does that extend the time -
Steve Sanghi: Net bookings divided by net billings. Our net billings are not equal to net revenue, because we don't recognize disti billings till they're shipped out.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint: Okay, understood. Do you accept bookings outside of a six month window? So are your bookings just the next three plus three or what are we looking at for, how far out your backlog?
Steve Sanghi: We accept the bookings out sort of the six months window, yes.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint: That's what I was after. And then one other question. You mentioned that in your December quarter it has one of the fewer shipping days. How many shipping days do we pick up when we go into March? Everyone is really struggling with sort of what is seasonality going to look like this year, given that we're in such an unusual environment. Do you guys have any opinion there and just if you could offer some guidance on how many shipping days we're going to pick up in March.
Steve Sanghi: So, if you look at it in round numbers, our Asia business is about half our business, a little more than half, 51.3 or something. And the U.S., Europe is other half. So, in December quarter, you missed the shipping days in U.S. and Europe. Asia usually keeps working, they don't have the Thanksgiving and Christmas, they only have one day off. Then when you go to the next quarter, U.S., Europe comes back with full shipping days but then Asia goes on Chinese New Year, large parts of Asia, China, Taiwan, Singapore, good parts of other countries, they go in Chinese New Year. Probably wash.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint: Okay. So, we would actually possibly get an impact there the first time that we're really holiday free is June, is that sort of the way to think about it?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. I haven't checked the calendar where the Easter lies. Sometimes Easter is in late March, sometimes it's in April. If the Easter is in April, then you pick up a week of holidays in Europe. Good parts of Europe. Not all of it.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint: And you guys have already commented on the impact that that longer lead times have had on the availability of business for you. But can you comment on has there been any noticeable change in the landscape with the mergers and balance sheet issues that some of your competitors are facing? Are customers having those types of high level discussions with you? Any commentary you could offer there would be helpful.
Steve Sanghi: Well, we talked about it last quarter. Most definitely so. And a number of incidents, where we have had inquiries, or look-ins, our designs have gone into our favor, has continued to go up. Lots of customers do not like the merger of (inaudible) assets and that's negative for them. There have been issues related to other competitors that have significant balance sheet challenges, one big one in U.S. and the other big one in Europe and so there are issues both related to that and we have won designs and people have shown concerns and all that, so yes, that's a very real factor. I think more than ever before, in 30 years of my business, customers historically haven't cared whether their supplier makes money or not. They don't care. Whether your supplier is profitable, they don't care, they just want the best price, best quality. But in the last year or so of the global financial crisis, where so many of their smaller suppliers, not necessarily in semiconductor doing whatever, so many companies have gone out of business that I think it has become a factor where companies are now asking more questions about sustainability and balance sheet and are you profitable and how will you continue to serve me. So first time ever I've seen in 30 years.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint: All right. Great. And thanks for the answers.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: Next is John Barton with Cowen.
John Barton – Cowen: Steve, maybe to follow on to that topic of design activity behavior at the customers. I guess my first question is in a business recovery, how much longer do you think customers focus on that scrutiny of the supply base, how quickly do they forget about the challenges they went through and the balance sheet challenges their suppliers had. And then secondly, in the reorgs that the customers have gone through, letting grow their own engineers, et cetera, have you seen a significant change in design win opportunity, frequency, meaning, guys trying to get new products to market, people trying to make the elder products last and I know historically you've always answered that it depends on the customer, but now that business is starting to stabilize, any new trends there?
Steve Sanghi: I think you kind of answered your own question. We had significant design win activity through our multiyear demand creation efforts and we were so well positioned a year ago. We had done a record in September quarter, and we were quite optimistic about where the business was headed in 16-bit and high end 8-bit and analog and others. And when the global financial crisis hits, that's sort of what happens where all designs freeze, people get laid off and customers don't launch their products into a very, very weak market because that launch will necessarily be wasted. Essentially be wasted. So you're seeing a lot of those designs which were parked for several quarters now proceeding to production. We saw that last quarter. We're seeing that in the current quarter. We are expediting products for a number of these customers, who're taking their designs to production.
Ganesh Moorthy: John, this is Ganesh. If I could add one more perspective. It's not just about are these other competitors financially viable alone. There are impacts of those folks have created on customers, where road maps have been changed, products have an end of life, factories have been closed down, and products been moved causing them to have issues, customer support has been reduced, and lead time has gone out. So there's a number of other factors beyond just financial viability that are playing into customers concerns.
John Barton – Cowen: So, I think I could read into your response there that you expect that phenomenon to have a pretty significant length of time, customers aren't going to forget this and have a bias towards Microchip as a result of all the positive support, all the things you just highlighted for at least the next, I don't know, year or two, is that a fair statement?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. Some last a year or two, some last five years and ten years. We have customers that we have served for a decade who we got them in the '99 and 2000 because they couldn't get the parts from somebody and we still have them. So some memories are very long, some memories are short. It's really all over the place.
John Barton – Cowen: As you look into the supply chain, and your customer base, obviously, people have to build ahead for Christmas because of cycle times, et cetera. Do you have any sense on how strong of a Christmas the supply chain is preparing for and maybe some form of year-over-year comparison?
Steve Sanghi: I think Christmas builds are done largely. Christmas builds are usually done by the end of September because whatever has to come on the ships has to take a six-week journey to get here before Thanksgiving. And some late products that will fly in the plane and all that are done by October or early part of November. So Christmas builds are largely down. Now, the next phase really is when the parts actually go on the floors and regarding what sells, which model sell, then you get replenishment orders for those designs on which you have to deliver on a fairly short lead time. That's sort of where some of the upsides come from.
John Barton – Cowen: Last question if I could. Could you just update us on your thoughts of M&A. Obviously, you've been very clear last couple quarters, tuck-in kind of acquisitions only if they make sense. Has the business starts to stabilize? Does that story change? Any reason to be more aggressive on that front
Steve Sanghi: Well, we don't really have anything on our plate. If you think we should look at something, please let us know.
John Barton – Cowen: Thanks, guys.
Operator: And next is Gil Alexander with Darphil Associates.
Gil Alexander – Darphil Associates: Congratulations. If we look longer-term, can you give us what your guidance is now for operating profits and tax rate?
Eric Bjornholt: So in our calendar '10 plan we provided an operating profit, GAAP, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
Gil Alexander – Darphil Associates: Right. That I have. But I was thinking of longer-term. You have a longer term model.
Eric Bjornholt: Our tax rate should stay in the range of 13% on a non-GAAP basis. It's just a bit lower than that on a GAAP basis, driven by some of the things that are taxed differently in the U.S. but it's in that 12.5% to 13.5% range.
Steve Sanghi: On the operating profit, there should be further leverage going into the calendar year '11, mainly on gross margin, could be a little bit on expenses, so certainly we do not peak out by the end of calendar year '10.
Gil Alexander – Darphil Associates: That I understand. I thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: And next is Craig Ellis with Caris and Company.
Craig Ellis – Caris and Company: Thank you, and nice job, guys. Steve, I'm wondering if you can share with us some insight from the bottom of model-ish look at 2010. Can you tell, given the design wins that you have, if the growth that you'll be getting on a full-year basis means that you'll be growing every quarter sequentially and is there anything that's notable about the growth, whether you're seeing stronger either first half or second half growth?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I can't break out the quarter but I guess I can confirm to you that we have growth dialed in every quarter.
Craig Ellis – Caris and Company: Okay. And then, switching gears on the inventory comments, there's an intent to build backup on an inventory days basis this quarter. Will you be at target inventory levels by the time you exit the calendar fourth quarter or would you expect to be replenishing inventory in the first calendar quarter as well?
Steve Sanghi: I think we'll be replenishing probably still. Our long-term target for the inventory has been 115 days. And our distributors are really holding lower inventory than historically they have or would like them to. In fact, Eric mentioned that our total inventory us plus distributors is a seven years low. So we're trying to rebuild those inventories. We put out lot more product last quarter, but it all shipped out as we had a huge growth. Our original guidance for the quarter was, what, 7% to 11% or something. And we did 17.5% so we were unable to build inventories. In fact, we depleted. We think we have ramped harder and we will grow inventory this quarter, but we do not know whether we will achieve our target, may still be growing at the following quarter. And with the existing inventory being much lower, I wouldn't mind if short-term we're able to get higher than 115 days, that would be positive for our business, especially because of competitive lead times are so long.
Craig Ellis – Caris and Company: Is there any particular product area where you want to replenish inventory or is it fairly uniform across your 8, 16 and 32-bit businesses as well as analog?
Steve Sanghi: It's largely uniform. You build it on all volume products where there are high frequency products that ship a lot and you don't tend to build on products that have 1C, 2C customers, and custom or whatever, so you really build on larger part types.
Craig Ellis – Caris and Company: Thanks, Steve.
Steve Sanghi: You’re welcome.
Operator: Moving on to Kevin Cassidy with Thomas Weisel Partners.
Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel Partners: Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering on the analog growth being so much higher than the microcontroller growth. Is it I guess higher content on microcontroller designs or you're getting into designs where your competitors have the microcontroller and you’re coming in with the analog?
Ganesh Moorthy: Remember there are three components to our analog strategy. First was the attach to our Microcontrollers, second was the attach to any Microcontrollers and the third is to any product on the other side. Doesn't have to be a microcontroller; can be a DSP; can be an FPGA; can be an ASEC, So, all three of those are contributing towards the growth that we're seeing and it's not uniquely driven just by our Microcontrollers only.
Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, so, do you think, following on with that strategy that having an analog component on a competitor's microcontroller design that you might eventually win the microcontroller?
Ganesh Moorthy: Absolutely. Because that gives us an understanding of the customer, it gives us an opportunity to engage when their design comes up for renewal, gives us an opportunity to provide some alternatives that they can consider, so it is a strength to be able to have an analog win even when we don't have our microcontroller on it.
Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel Partners: And you are seeing some success there?
Ganesh Moorthy: Absolutely.
Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Moving on to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
Shroff – Credit Suisse: This is Shroff [ph] for John Pitzer. Thanks for taking my question. As you mentioned earlier, your 8-bit MCO market share year-to-date in 2009 was higher versus 2008. However, if you look at the quarterly SIA data looks like you undergrew 8-bit MCUs for the second straight quarter in September. Are there any reasons or thoughts behind this or should we not be reading it as such quarterly trends?
Steve Sanghi: What did he say?
Ganesh Moorthy: The quarterly data.
Eric Bjornholt: He thinks on a quarterly basis that we underperformed in 8-bit.
Steve Sanghi: How do you know our 8-bit numbers? We've never broken it out for you so it's again your own estimates, which we haven't confirmed. The SIA data is erratic quarter-to-quarter. So, SIA says 8-bit microcontrollers grew 29% sequentially, okay, and so there are large amount of adjustments that usually go after three months to six months later and the vice old numbers, so SIA numbers you have to look at it over a period of time. The number I gave you was December quarter to September quarter, which I can trust a lot more than I can trust just one quarter data. Which Company have you heard so far that announced results, which will make you believe that 8-bit Microcontrollers grew 29%?
Shroff – Credit Suisse: Q Yes, well, that's a fair point.
Steve Sanghi: Makes sense. That's the problem with that data. But if you look at it over the year and after they have revised it and all that the data makes more sense. They maybe low last quarter and up this quarter and so don't take too much stock into SIA's number for a single quarter. There is a special problem that I have seen for decade plus in SIA's numbers on Microcontrollers, which may or may not exist. I think it doesn't exist when you look at microprocessors, you look at flash memories, you look at SBGAs. In micro processors, you look at two companies and you get the number right almost. In SBGAs you look at two or three public companies you might get the number right. But on Microcontrollers, there are 25 competitors and large amount of microcontroller data is Toshiba shipping to Toshiba, Samsung shipping to Samsung, Hitachi, for just to shipping it to their own companies, so I particularly find SIA finds it impossible to get at those numbers, because fair amount of business is really long tail and you can't take two or three companies numbers, plus we're the largest in 8-bit and they don't have our numbers, we're announcing today and we still don't break out 8-bit so how do they get the 8-bit numbers. Atmil [ph] hasn’t announced yet. And they're in the top five or six 8-bit manufacturers. So I take the data with a grain of salt. But longer-term, when I give you the data, I think it's a higher chance of being accurate.
Shroff – Credit Suisse: Got it. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: We'll hear once again from Chris Danely.
Chris Danely – JPMorgan: Thanks, guys. I'll be brief. I just have two quick follow-ups. So Steve, it sounds like you guys have plenty more room for utilization rates to move up, i.e. gross margins?
Steve Sanghi: Well, correct. Utilization is nowhere close to the old record. Utilization will continue to move up, but when a big portion of the progress in percentage terms and the progress from here is slower, it will happen over the next many quarters. As I said, we don't even reach the peak by the Q4 of calendar year '10. It will continue into calendar year '11.
Chris Danely – JPMorgan: Got you. And so if you look at your 2010 guidance and it looks like you guys will be close to the previous peak revenue, but I think you mentioned your gross margins might be a little bit below the previous peak, I think you said mix issues. Can you just talk about the differences and do you feel confident, you'll be able to get back to the previous peak gross margin?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we just don't really know. I think when the business has gone through so much surgery where the gross margins are rising 200 basis points to 300 basis points per quarter as they have done recently, it's very hard to look out six quarters and do an estimate on exactly what mix the products will be and what your utilization would be and what your expense structure would be and so we just haven't done that yet, but there is really no fundamental reason why we should not get reasonably close to our model.
Chris Danely – JPMorgan: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Moving on to Ray Rund with Shaker Investments.
Ray Rund – Shaker Investments: Thank you for taking my question. You've given so much information already; it's kind of been like trying to drink from a fire hose. I was just curious about – I may have missed these numbers, but can you just specify what your CapEx was in the quarter and what your depreciation was?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. We have it.
Eric Bjornholt: So CapEx was about $6 million in the September quarter and depreciation was $21.7 million.
Ray Rund – Shaker Investments: Thank you. Just wanted to add my congratulations. Obviously, you had a really good quarter and looks like you're managing the business for future growth in a very good way, so thank you.
Operator: And our last question will come from Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji – UBS: Thank you very much. Steve, I just wanted to follow up one more time on your 32-bit microcontroller comments relative to ARM. You made a comment that you're gaining share regardless of the fact that – I just wanted to get a sense. When you compete against arm-based controllers, microcontroller companies, what are the differentiating factors? I mean it's quite impressive and congratulations for that, that you're able to continue to do well in the market that arm seems to dominate. So can you just please remind me some of the factors that continue to help you to win here and how much runway that is left in 32-bit? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: We don't want the competitors listening on this call to know why we win with our PIC32 with what features. Having said that, I can provide you some (inaudible).
Uche Orji – UBS: Q. Go on then.
Steve Sanghi: I mean, I don't want to give the exact answer, but we can give you some flavor.
Uche Orji – UBS: Okay.
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh Moorthy?
Ganesh Moorthy: I think if you look at what customers buy, they're trying to buy a platform and I think we offer with the PIC platform a range of products with peripheral compatibility, with development tools that are common across 8, 16s and 32s. I mean you've heard all the key reasons from us before, and I think many of those carry through in the PIC32 domain of designs we're competing for as well. But at the end of the day, we obviously provide customers the right combination of value that gives them a choice to use our platform with confidence and to grow with us.
Uche Orji – UBS: Thank you very much.
Operator: There are no further questions. Mr. Sanghi, I would like to turn the conference back over to you for closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Who was that?
Ganesh Moorthy: Uche, are you still – is the line still open?
Operator: One moment, sir. We'll open his line.
Steve Sanghi: Okay.
Uche Orji – UBS:
 :
Steve Sanghi: I had a question for you, Uche, before you go. What portion of 32-bit Microcontrollers do you believe are arm based in the industry?
Uche Orji – UBS: It's hard to say, but if you look at just about everybody else that is in the 32-bit microcontroller, some have their own, some use arm.
Steve Sanghi: Largest fallacy. That's the largest fallacy, which I'm really surprised about, when you talk about misinformation, only 20% of total worldwide 32-bit Microcontrollers are arm based. There are a number of other architectures, which are substantially higher than some of all arm based Microcontrollers.
Uche Orji – UBS: Most of these other guys also even while they sell their own microcontroller, based on their own technology, most of them have licensed arm whether has a hedge or just as a way to drive (inaudible) One of the few major companies in the segment that has no done that and I'm just curious as to –
Steve Sanghi: 20 years ago, it was the same situation in 8-bit with 8051. Everybody had Intel's architecture 8051. Microchip came with a proprietary architecture with PIC and where is 8051 today and where are we now?
Ganesh Moorthy: Uche, another way to think about it is the core is really a means to an end. The core is not the end. Some how some of the discussions get trapped into this thing as somehow the arm core is the end result. It's just is a delivery mechanism for how you deliver an embedded control solution. If the core was that important, don't you think Microchip would have done a proprietary core for ourselves as opposed to go on with an industry standard core? We picked a core around which we could wrap our proprietary value.
Uche Orji – UBS: That's clear. Thank you very much. I think I understand your point.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Uche. Operator, anybody else queued in?
Operator: There are no further questions, sir.
Steve Sanghi: Okay, we want to thank all our investors and analysts on this call. It's been a great quarter and we look forward to seeing many of you on the road. I think there are some conferences coming up. We'll be at the next conferences, CSFB conference, which is actually in our backyard here in Scottsdale, in early December, so we'll see many of you there. Thank you very much.
Operator: This does conclude our conference call today. We would like to thank you for your participation.

===== 2010 Q1  (2009-08-06 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Eric Bjornholt - CFO Steve Sanghi - President and CEO Ganesh Moorthy - EVP and COO
Analysts: Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel partner Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities John Barton - Cowen Boyd Jim - JPMorgan Gil Alexander - Darphil Associates Craig Ellis - Caris & Company John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to this Microchip Technology first quarter and fiscal year's 2010 financial results conference call. As a reminder today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Bjornholt: During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events for the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that those, such statements are predictions and actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 and our 8-K current reports that we have filed with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, President and CEO, Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President and COO and Gordon Parnell, Vice President, Business Development and Investor Relations. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal 2010 financial performance and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment, discuss our guidance for the September quarter and update other pertinent matters regarding our business. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analysts questions. Net sales for the June quarter were $192.9 million up approximately 11.4% from net sales of $173.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down approximately 28.1% from net sales of $268.2 million in the prior year's first quarter. On a geographic basis, revenue in the Americas was up 4.7% in the June quarter. Europe was down 7.4%, and Asia was up 29.5%. Asia continues to be our largest geographic region representing 48.7% of sales. The Americas are 25.6% of sales, and Europe is 25.7% of sales. These measurements are based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes for our customers, but does not necessarily represent, where the design activity is taking place to where the end product consumption is occurring. We are continuing to include information in our press release on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Non-GAAP results exclude share-based compensation expense, gains and losses on trading securities, acquisition related expenses, costs to acquire patent portfolio licenses, non-recurring events and the impacts from a tax basis of these excluded items. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on our Investor Relations page of the website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful, when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $35 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, an increase of 25.4% from non-GAAP net income of $27.9 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 57.6% from non-GAAP net income of $82.6 million, or $0.44 per diluted share in the prior year's first quarter. The aftertax impact on the June quarterly earnings that have been excluded from our non-GAAP results include $7.8 million in share-based compensation expense, $3.4 million in gains from trading securities, a $1.1 million charge associated with the acquisition of a patent license, $1.1 million in charges associated with our acquisition activities, and $0.9 million non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt. GAAP earnings per share for the June quarter were $0.15 per diluted share. I will now go through some of the operating results for the June quarter. I will be referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis, prior to the effect of share-based compensation, acquisition related expenses and the acquisition of a patent license. Gross margins were 51.4% in the June quarter compared to 49.3% in the March quarter. The quarterly increase in gross profit margin was driven by a variety of factors including higher production activity in our factories, continued cost reduction efforts from our global manufacturing operations, and a favorable product mix from the sale of our proprietary products. With the increase in revenue, we were able to achieve operating leverage from the business with total operating expenses of 29.2% of sales in the June quarter, compared to 30% in the prior quarter Research and development costs were the $24.6 million representing 12.8% of sales. Sales and general administrative expenses were $31.8 million representing 16.5% of sales. Operating expenses continue to be managed appropriately based on the overall economic environment. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins including share-based compensation, and acquisition-related expenses were 50%. Total operating expenses were $65.3 million or 33.8% of sales and include share-based compensation of $7.3 million, acquisition-related expenses of $0.3 million, and an expense associated with the acquisition of a patent license of $1.2 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the tax rate for the June quarter was 13%. The GAAP effective tax rate for the March quarter was 16.2%. The difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates was driven primarily from the higher tax rate that applied to the gains on our trading securities and the non-cash interest expense on our convertible debt. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax advantage securities. The dividend declared today of $33.9 per share will be paid on September 3, 2009 to the shareholders of record on August 20, 2009. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $62.2 million. Moving on to the balance sheet, in the June-quarter, Microchip adopted FSP APB 14-1, accounting for convertible debt instruments that maybe settled in cash upon conversion. The adoption of this pronouncement required Microchip to record some significant balance sheet reclassification during the quarter, and retrospectively apply the accounting change to our prior GAAP financial statements. The major impacts of adopting this new accounting pronouncement in the June quarter were to reclassify $813 million of debt to equity record a $313.2 million deferred tax liability, for the debt that was reclassified to equity, to record non-cash interest expense to reflect the accretion of the remaining debt on balance sheet to the par value of the debt over the life of the convertible, and to adjust retained earnings by 4.4 million for the retrospective adoption of this accounting pronouncement. Microchip recorded $1.5 million of non-cash interest expense in the June quarter, and we will continue to have a charge for non-cash interest expense for the balance of the term of the convertible. The non-cash interest expense will be about $1.6 million in each of the remaining quarters of fiscal 2010. Although our financial statement presentation related to our convertible debt was changed significantly due to the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement, the overall economics and the cash flow have not changed. Microchip's inventory balance at June 30, 2009 was 113.9 million, representing approximately 108 days. Inventory on Microchip's balance sheet was reduced by 17.6 million or 26 days in the June quarter. At June 30, 2009, our distributors were holding about 38 days of inventory, which is similar to the levels that they were holding at the end of March. With combined inventory days of 146, we have right sized our inventory position allowing our factories to increase their production output in the September quarter, and produce higher gross margins. At June 30th, our receivables were 98 million, an increase of 9.5 million or 10.8% for the balance as of the end of March. Receivable balances continue to be in excellent condition and we haven’t seen any material deterioration in the payment performance from our customers. We continue to closely monitor customer activity to insure we are protecting the receivable assets on our balance sheet. As of June 30th, Microchip cash and total investment position was $1.438 billion, a decrease of $2.6 million from the March balance including a $61.9 million dividend payment and a $12.2 million payment related to interest on our convertible debt. With interesting payment on the convertible debt made quarterly instead of semi annually, our cash balance would have grown during the June quarter. Our cash generation continues to be strong and we fully expect our cash and total investment position to increase in the September 2009 quarter. Capital spending was approximately 4.1 million for the June-quarter and our fiscal 2010 capital expenditure forecast is currently $20 million. The fiscal 2010 capital forecast represents a reduction of 80% from the fiscal 2009 levels, and we are selectively investing in equipment to support the revenue growth of our new products and technologies. Depreciation expense for the June quarter was $21.7 million, compared to $23.2 million in the same quarter last fiscal year, and $22.9 million in the March quarter. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: I will comment on the individual product lines. Let's start with microcontrollers. Our microcontrollers business was up strong 11.9% on a sequential basis. Flash Microcontrollers represented approximately 80.5% of our microcontroller business in the June quarter. Our 8-bit microcontrollers business had an excellent quarter, as all segments of our 8-bit product line experienced strong growth. Our 16-bit microcontroller business also had a strong quarter, with 15.7% sequential growth, and 33.3% growth from the year ago quarter, as well as another record for quarterly revenue. New customers and new designs going to production continue to help drive growth, as the number of volume 16-bit customers grew by 145 customers to 1,842. Our 32-bit microcontroller product line meanwhile continues to make good progress with the number of customers and volume production approaching 100. Moving to Development Tools, we had a record quarter with 35,608 development tool shipped in the June quarter. We also passed another key milestone, during the quarter with the shipment of our 800,000 cumulative development tool. Both milestones are indicative of continued strong design and activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers and should bode well for future growth. In April, Microchip introduced industry's lowest power microcontrollers with the announcement of our XLP or extreme low power microcontrollers. The combination of high functionality and low power offered by Microchip is unparalleled among microcontrollers suppliers and capitalizes on an increasing trend of battery power and power-constrained applications. Since that announcement customer interest as well as our design win momentum has been strong and we have continue to press our advantage with the introduction of a steady stream of additional new XLP microcontrollers. We now have over 50 microcontrollers with extreme low power technology in production. Microchip is also continue to make significant strides in establishing our leadership in the growing area of touch technology with the touch sensing and touch screen solutions. We now have over 100 customers in volume production, using our touch technology solutions including marque names like General Electric, Siemens, Samsung, LG, Toyota, JVC, Panasonic, Toshiba, Activision, Logitech and NCR among them. We also have over 500 other customers, who are actively designing with our MTEC solutions. We are very pleased with the market interest, the customer acceptance, the design win momentum and revenue growth of our broad range of MTEC solutions and are existed by the potential to drive growth. Moving to an Analog products, our Analog business was up a strong 12.2% sequentially. Here too pleased with the design win and revenue momentum this business has shown and we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new products and expect continued strong revenue growth for our analog business in the coming quarters. Finally on serial [E2] memory, that business was up 5.5% sequentially and we continue to run this business in a disciplined fashion and maintain consistent profitability and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. With that let me now pass it to Steve, for some general comments as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: First of all we are getting a feedback that the webcast was started a few minutes late apparently someone forgot to push the button and some of the information that Eric gave especially geographic information was missed by the ones, who are listening to the webcast. So, I will give that information again. On a geographic basis, revenue in Americas was up 4.7% in the June quarter. Europe was down 7.4% and Asia was up 29.5%. Asia continues to be our largest geographic region representing 48.7% of sales, the Americas at 25.6% of sales and Europe is 25.7% of sales. These measurements are based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes and it doesn't necessarily represent, where the design activity maybe taking place. That was the part that was missed. Today I would like to first reflect on the results of the June quarter, and then I will talk about our guidance for our September 2009 quarter. The June quarter saw a strong rebound from the bottom established in the March quarter. We originally set our internal plan for the June quarter at up 5% sequentially. In early June, we guided up to between 8% and 10% growth, and I am pleased to report that we exceeded the high end of that guidance, by achieving a sequential revenue growth of 11.4%. We also exceeded the gross margin guidance, beating the high end of the gross margin guidance by 70 basis points. The strength of our gross margins continues to validate the strong proprietary value embedded in our products and our franchise. Our earnings per share both GAAP and non-GAAP exceeded the high end of our guidance on the strength of strong revenue growth, strong gross margins, and excellent cost control on the operating expense side. Our inventory came down to 134 days at the end of March quarter, came from 134 days at the end of the March quarter to 108 days at the end of June quarter. The inventories now below our target of 115 days, therefore we have started to grow the wafer starts in our fab, the increased manufacturing utilization will have a positive effect on our gross margins. We expect gross margins for September quarter to be up a between 250 to 350 basis points above June quarter. From a product line perspective, our increased focus in two areas of microcontrollers is paying off. Ganesh discussed both of them and I will summarize them again. First, we have introduced an industry-leading extreme low power microcontroller product line. That is making waves throughout the industry. We have 50 products in production on this XPL product line and we are gaining significant design activity on the new products, displacing the competition in most cases. Secondly, we have a leading technical solution on touch-sense microcontrollers. We are currently shipping volume silicon to over 100 customers and have over 500 customers that are designing with our MTECH solution; our design wins span a variety of industrial, consumer, automotive, medical, PC and communication applications. Our financial results clearly indicate that our business model is working and was profitable even at the bottom of this deep recession, while a majority of our competitors lost money, Microchip just posted over 22% operating profit, a testament to the resiliency of our business model, the loyalty of our customer base, the hard work of our employees worldwide, and the competitive advantage of our company culture. We have been profitable for 75 consecutive quarters and the September quarter will be our 76th. I also wanted to highlight the comparison to SIA numbers, Semiconductor Industry Association numbers that were recently released. While Microchip does not participate in SIA and short-term SIA numbers are often suspect and later revised, many of the investors and analysts follow those numbers. Based on SIA data, cumulatively over the last two quarters, SIA’s 8 plus 16-bit microcontrollers were down 18.5%, while Microchip's 8 plus 16-bit microcontrollers were up 1.2% over the last two quarters, showing significant market share gain. Microchip in the first half of 2009 had its highest market share of 8-bit microcontrollers ever. For those who have predicted market share losses for our 8-bit microcontrollers, I hope this data puts your concerns to rest and we steadily and continuously keep gaining market share in 16-bit achieving record sales in the June quarter. From a competitive standpoint, our product line is one of the strongest in the history, with the broadest coverage from low end 8-bit to high end 32-bit, from lowest power XPL product line to high performance MCUs and with the broadest set of peripherals in touch sense, motor control, digital power supplies, connectivity, analog and RF, our microcontroller product lines continues to be the compelling solution for the market. We have significantly broadened our served available market and we are getting a large number of design wins outside of our traditional core group of customers. Regarding specific competitors, we are already getting customer inquiries and design wins due to concerns about the pending merger of NEC and Renesas, other competitors like Freescale and STMicroelectronics are in significant restructuring mode, Freescale’s microcontroller business was down 3.3% sequentially versus Microchip being up 11.9% sequentially. Freescale blamed it on the weakness of automotive business. We did an analysis of our top direct automotive customers. Microchip's automotive business was up 17.5% sequentially. Our automotive business was sequentially up in all geographies with US automotive up 10.6%, clearly evidencing market share gains for Microchip. Investors and analysts have also been concerned about our consumer business, with the similar top direct customer analysis, the home appliances part of our business was up 10% sequentially. We cannot differentiate between what someone called it as the correction of the inventory correction and market share gains to new design. We believe that there are some of both, but the performance relative to competitors clearly points to market share gains. Regarding Atmel, Atmel has lost momentum on microcontrollers as seen by the results in the last two quarters. It was clear to us that Atmel’s prior year's growth was inflated due to the acquisition of Quantum, that distorted year-over-year numbers and due to the reclassification of significant microcontroller business from prior years to ASIC. Let's be mindful of the similar tactics going forward and watch for the reclassification of ASIC business back to microcontrollers to show higher growth for MCUs. Overall, Microchip sees plenty of opportunities for continued market share gains and we are boldly making new investments in product lines, people, customer training and distributors and we see continued market share gains ahead. Now I will discuss our guidance for the September quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio for June quarter was 1.18, and our starting backlog for the September quarter was significantly higher than our starting backlog was for the June quarter. So, the visibility is improving significantly, the bookings rate so far in the quarter has been strong, on the other hand, we are now in August, and Europe is sure to go on summer vacation. Considering all that, we expect our net sales for the September quarter to be up between 7%and 11% sequentially. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 54% and 55%, which is 250 to 350 basis points improvement over the June quarter. This improvement in gross margin percentage is primarily driven by higher factory utilization. Our inventories are now fully corrected and are actually below our target. We will continue to ramp our factories to meet the increase in demand, the gross margin percentage through the balance of fiscal year '10 will dependent on revenue increases in subsequent quarters. We currently expect about 100 basis points in improvement in gross margin percentage in each of fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4. Regarding earnings per share guidance for the September quarter, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.23 and $0.26 and we expect GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.18 and $0.20. Both GAAP as well as non-GAAP earnings per share assume no effect of mark-to-market considerations on public securities owned. As you can see from our balance sheet, we produced very strong cash flow last quarter, and were nearly able to cover our dividend and the interest payments on the convertible without dipping into cash reserves. Starting the September quarter, we actually expect to build cash even after paying our dividend. The coupon payment is every six months. We are glad to have demonstrated to investors our strong commitment to the dividend, unlike many S&P 500 companies; we did not cut our dividend even through the deepest part of the recession. I want to take this opportunity to thank our customers, investors, analysts and employees, for their support through this very difficult period and assure them that their support is never taken for granted. With that operator, would you please poll for questions?
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Brendan Furlong from Miller Tabak.
Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak: Quick question on the SG&A, should we think about it, running in the 32% to 33% for the foreseeable future here for the next three, four quarters at least?
Eric Bjornholt: Well, you can see from the information in the press release and the outlook section that we have actually, the range is to be flat to down up to about 75 basis points. It will depending on what revenue that we can see some incremental leverage there. 
Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak: I’m looking more into Q3 and into fiscal '11, should we consider more or less around the same percentage of revenues?
Steve Sanghi: It will largely depend on how much revenue growth is there beyond this quarter and we don't have visibility, but with revenue growth you should continue to see some operating leverage.
Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak: Okay. My other housekeeping question, then just on the tax rate going forward, you are guiding 12% next quarter. Should we consider that the run rate on the future quarters?
Eric Bjornholt: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy from Thomas Weisel partner.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel partner: On the automotive side, what's your exposure to Europe and Asia and US, as you compare the three markets?
Steve Sanghi: Our exposure every time we have looked at is really nearly a third, a third, a third.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel partner: Okay. So, your US was up 10%. So, were you stronger in any one of them, Europe or Asia?
Steve Sanghi: You have to be.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel partner: Which one of, which one?
Steve Sanghi: We don't have the info.
Eric Bjornholt: Both of them were strong.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel partner: Okay. Is it analog products along with microcontrollers, or is it just the microcontrollers, that you are selling into automotive.
Steve Sanghi:  We sell all of our products, but the dominant really are microcontrollers. That's the majority of our business. The analog portion in automotive will be relatively small.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel partner: Okay. I guess just as we were talking about the different markets and as you are gaining back market share. Do you think some of it is related to the markets you addressed growing faster than some of the other markets or is it a complete swap out of one microcontroller for your microcontroller?
Steve Sanghi:  Well, Kevin, you used the word gaining back market share. Our data does not show that we lost any market share. It was a direct correlation to the consumer segment and housing basically leading the downturn, and it was so strong that it took the global financial system into a melt down, but when that was happening and we were seeing a substantial fall from it. Other companies were not as exposed to it and no matter how much we explained it, I don't think it ever got through and we were winning a large number of design wins. We were doing record number of development systems quarter after quarter. The 16-bit growth was strong, and you are seeing the result of many of this design going to production. So, there really not any dislocations from our standpoint, we had a heavy concentration in consumer and automotive and consumer clearly led the decline and automotive then joined later. So, during that time, yes we had largest fall than some of the competitors, but as we have said our 8-bit market share is the largest we have ever had 8-bit market share.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ruben Roy from Pacific Crest Securities.
Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities: Hi, Steve, I don't think you talked too much about the industrial market. Can you give us an update on what's going on there and what your outlook is for industrial?
Ganesh Moorthy: This is Ganesh. The breath of what we are seeing in the market is, across all the segments that we participate in. So, clearly not only have we seen it in automotive and home appliances, as Steve talked about, but the other segments including industrial have shown strength and many of those are designs we have been incubating and working on. Some of them are older designs, as they come back into a higher level of consumption. So, industrial has been good.
Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Ganesh, do you have a 16-bit development tool number for the quarter?
Ganesh Moorthy: I don't have it, off the top of my head, but we will get one to you.
Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay and then just I guess for Eric, there was a question on OpEx maybe I’ll ask a little bit differently. We are seeing some stabilization here and then Steve talked a bottom being established in March. It is an improvement in the environment, how are you going to start thinking about potentially getting more aggressive with investing in the business?
Eric Bjornholt: Well, we feel that we are investing in the business as appropriate. We still think that our operating expense as a percentage of sales compared to others is really quite good, but we are not under-investing in the business to make sure that we continue to have success with future design wins and new products.
Steve Sanghi: Remember through the downturn we did not do any layoff. So, all of our sales and marketing and design and product resources have been fully invested. So, product line is just absolutely awesome and fully trained people going to take it to market. So, we have essentially been ready more than ever before very, very, strong recovery trough the downturn as we came out, product line is very strong, lots of new products. We are not hiring now to really build back because we let whole bunch of people go. We cut expenses largely through pay cuts and zeroing of the bonuses and as the businesses recovering now; we are giving some of the pay cuts back to the employees. So, that’s adding little bit to the operating expense, but the revenue is growing faster than that. So, we are getting operating leverage at the same time, we have all these trained employees doing an awesome job of improving everything in the company.
Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities: Great and then just last question. Can you give us a utilization level for the June quarter and then the outlook for September?
Steve Sanghi: All we can say is the utilization will be higher this quarter than last quarter. We have stopped giving the numbers because we have found it to be very confusing. There are many technologies, some have less number of steps and some have larger numbers of steps, portion of the business comes from foundries and you can't really plug from point A to point B and based on the revenue, calculate the gross margin. It does not work and we have found that’s an extrapolation by the analysts to be highly confusing and misleading. Basically giving you the guidance, we gave you the guidance for the gross margin for the September quarter, and we also gave you guidance for the following couple of quarters with about 100 basis points improvement in each quarter.
Ruben Roy - Pacific Crest Securities: All right and then sorry, Steve just one last one, I think historically the September-quarter has been back end loaded. Do you expect linearity to be any difference in this quarter for any reason?
Steve Sanghi: The backlog is very strong for September quarter. Usually it slows down quite a bit and usually you get a lot of the orders in September, but this time it’s different. This time we had very strong bookings in July, August can seem to be very, very strong. The backlog is filling very nicely and that's why we reverted from giving you a internal target back to giving guidance. For the last two quarters we gave you internal target, we didn’t give you guidance. We gave you guidance and we also gave you fairly narrower guidance compared to many of our competitors because our backlog is very strong.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from John Barton with Cowen.
John Barton - Cowen: Steve you highlighted the fact you have customers coming to you because of some of the challenges that your competitors are having, some economic-driven M&A etcetera. How od you see that over the next several quarters? Do you think as the economy stabilizes, you won't have that same trend? How are you feeling about that?
Steve Sanghi: I’d expect it to increase because the merger hasn't happened yet. So, as the merger happens and as we start to rationalize product lines and architectures and combine sales offices and distributors and one salesman stays and the other one goes and all of these changes. So, we are simply seeing the front end of really what people maybe concerned about, but the restructuring is not only and you see in the assets, as you can see everyone of our competitors essentially is restructuring significantly, most of the competitors. So, there is a lot of continuation. Over the years, in the last 20 years or so, we have not seen customers largely concerned about whether their supplier makes money. If a customer is getting a good product at a good cost, they don't really care, whether the supplier is financially profitable or not. First time ever through the cycle, we are seeing people really concerned because some of the people have not received the support through very large layoffs and other lot of companies have lost the support they used to get from the suppliers, maybe technical support, maybe customer service, maybe a specific sales people or the samples or whatever it maybe. People are experiencing significantly lower support. One company that hasn't cut back on that support at all is Microchip.
John Barton - Cowen: Any response to previous question about OpEx? You alluded decidedly a bit issuing out of bonus, pay cuts I think what I heard you say, just want to clarify this. You have already started to return some of those cuts, we saw some of it in the June quarter, you will continue going forward, but you will do it at a rate that’s slower than the revenue growth. We don’t have to worry about the step functional up OpEx, impacting the bottom line in the foreseeable future. Did I interpret your statements correctly?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, correctly. You should continue to see operating expense leverage.
John Barton - Cowen: Last question if I could, last quarter you talked about the fact that M&A’s strategy was pretty much limited to small technology tuck in type affairs, still looking at it that way does the stabilization of the end market change your view of that?
Steve Sanghi: It does not change the view of that.
Operator: We will now go to Christ Danely from JPMorgan.
Boyd Jim - JPMorgan: This is Boyd Jim for Chris. I want to get a sense of which you think relative to growth rates in your MCU analog memory businesses for the next few quarters, but the some of the drivers (Inaudible) say for that.
Ganesh Moorthy: I don't want to break out the growth rates at that level of fineness, but the drivers that are going to be producing that growth. We expect 8-bit will grow. It is the largest piece of the microcontroller business. The 16-bit will grow at an even faster rate, than that. We expect the 32-bit growth to be as good a better than, where 16-bit is at so. All aspects of microcontrollers we expect will grow, but the newer product lines having much faster growth. We expect analog for several quarters here is going to have very good growth. The product line has had an excellent acceptance and designs wins. You have seen that already in the last quarter with over 12% growth. You are going to see that for several quarters here. So, those are the fundamental drivers. It’s our microcontroller business 8, 16s, 32s and is a analog business.
Boyd Jim - JPMorgan: Just another question around your memory business, how your prices trending in that business? In the past quarter and going forward?
Ganesh Moorthy: Memory is a competitive market. We play in the aspects of those business that are important for us to be in. We are not trying to chase revenue at the expense of gross margins in that business. Our ASPs have been trending down at a historical rate, but nothing that is of concern to us.
Boyd Jim - JPMorgan: Just one last question, it sounds like your auto business did really well. How is your auto compared to your peek historically? Is it how much down is it in comparison to the peek?
Ganesh Moorthy: I don't have a percentage of where it’s going to be. Obviously it went down as a percentage as automotive had its decline, but it’s not that easy for us to be able to track at a fine detail of every automotive account. I think what Steve gave was a sense of a representative sample of our large automotive customers that we have direct insight into.
Steve Sanghi: 62% of our business it’s from distribution, where we do not get a break down, whether they are consumer, industrial, automotive or what. So, these can vertical market analysis, we hardly ever do, and we internally see no value because our products are standard to go into all five markets. So, once in a while, when there is a lot of noise on Wall Street, we can do a simple analysis like we have done this time, but routinely we are not run by vertical markets. We run horizontally by producing very feature rich productions that sell horizontally across all markets to 70,000 customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gil Alexander from Darphil Associates.
Gil Alexander - Darphil Associates: Could you give us an idea of what the market share is in the field programmable 8-bit market?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I can say that it is very high, when we used to track that and used to break these numbers out, our market share was about a third of the entire market.
Gil Alexander - Darphil Associates: Right.
Steve Sanghi: Since then significant additional portion of the market has converted from non-field programmable to field programmable. Everybody else, who wasn't making field programmable microcontroller is now making field programmable, and a lot of the competitors have converted their non-field programmable customers to their field programmable. So, majority of the market is field programmable. So, market share of the overall market is like I said it’s a record in the first half, and market share of field programmable market is even higher than that, but we don't know what the number is.
Gil Alexander - Darphil Associates: I know we're in recovery state, but is there a way of judging what the 8-bit programmable market should grow over the next few years. It’s tough to do. Because you are in a recovery state, but should it be something like 5% to 7%, if you took out the recovery of the market?
Steve Sanghi: We don't really know how to put numbers on them, when various market analysts are $1 billion apart on the $5.5 million market on the size of the 8-bit market, then 5% differential analysis is not meaningful. That has been the main issue that, unlike SPGAs unlike microprocessors, microcontroller market is highly fragmented with large number of competitors having significant internal consumption especially in Japan and Europe and the overall size of the microcontroller market that we hear from SIA never jives with what we hear from any of the other market analysts, which give a break down by company, like data processing and others. So, this has always been a big challenge. So, you pick your target either look at Dataquest or look at SIA or look at somebody else and consistently watch them and you can see a trend, but if you jump around and try to figure out what the size of the market is, you get a number of plus or minus $1 billion. So, by consistently watching the number we are telling you that our market share for 8-bit microcontroller is the highest we have ever had.
Gil Alexander - Darphil Associates: Just for housekeeping, what’s your depreciation estimate for the year?
Eric Bjornholt: It is about $88 million.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Ellis from Caris & Company
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company: Steve, you provided some commentary on potential gross margin met in the second half of the year. Obviously there was some underlying revenue assumptions around that. I am wondering you can provide some color there, whether it’s just normal seasonality, something north or south of normal and whether you think there is any channel inventory build that might be occurring there, as we think about those parameters.
Steve Sanghi: It is north of normal. That's really all I can say.
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company: Okay and then switching gears regionally, Europe was down in the June quarter, no surprise it seems like everybody just talked about Europe is seeing weakness there, but as you have moved into the first fiscal quarter, are you starting to see that geography stabilized or what you are seeing out of Europe, as you start to move through the quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Europe seasonally is the weakest in the summer quarter, which is the quarter, we are in right now. We are not seeing it this year, and it could just be driven by usually they're very strong in the March quarter and this year they were not. There was the depth of the recession for them. Usually they are okay in June quarter and they were not. They were down. So, you are getting some effect now in the current quarter, where they usually down this quarter and this quarter it doesn’t look like. So, seasonalities all screwed up by geography. I think as this business recovers in another year or so, we are going to have to almost establish what the cyclicality of each geographies and what the cyclicality of the business is.
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company: Okay. So, you have started to see an improvement in your European business.
Steve Sanghi: Yes.
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company: Okay and then lastly from me, you mentioned that you see plenty of opportunity for share gain out there, can you pin point some of the opportunities that you see?
Steve Sanghi: Broadly we are gaining share in every single market, 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and analog. You could break it out by vertical markets. We don't have that tracking, but it seems like we are gaining share in automotive, in industrial, in medical and by applications. We serve thousands of applications. We are in everything you own or everything you see that has power connected to it.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Steve, just wondering, when you look at the September revenue guidance, what’s the expectation for just the inventories? You expect September to be a quarter, where inventories stay flat, go down, build a little bit?
Eric Bjornholt:  We would project that in terms of number of days that inventories are going to hold that would be about flat.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: About flat sequentially?
Eric Bjornholt: In day, in dollars we would expect it to be up to maintain that level of days with increasing revenue.
Steve Sanghi: Then Steve is there any way to quantify the dollar opportunity with NEC- Renesas merger as far as what’s you can potentially pick up and what timeframe?
Steve Sanghi: I don’t know how to do that.
Eric Bjornholt: It’s a target rich environment. They have a lots business so.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Steve if not a dollar amount, what kind of time line would you expect to start to see any potentially share gain start run in to the P&L?
Steve Sanghi: It’s a usual start. Certain fast moving application the design cycle can be faster than six months, but majority of that is, year, year and half and slow moving not even longer. So, it just you don't really know. People are in all different stages, when the design is going to finish. When the design comes up for renewal, everybody just doesn't get up one day and say okay let's move. They move because there is a platform change coming up or an upgrade design coming up or buys no longer available, and there is just nowhere to speculate anything like that right now.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Steven, just given the book-to-bill number for June of 1.18, the guidance for revenue to be up 7% to 11%. My understanding as you would expect that the September quarter would actually be stronger linearity in the first half and then slow because of Europe, its seasonality in the second half of the September quarter. Is that the way to think of it?
Steve Sanghi: If you are trying to talk about book-to-bill and the revenue growth in the breadth is never worked and we have told you that many times before. There is no correlation. There is no correlation historically between a book-to-bill ratio and revenue growth. Book-to-bill ratio is simply function of whether the customer is placed the orders early or placed it orders in the quarter.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Okay. If I take book-to-bill, at the questions you just linearity in the September quarter front half loaded and then slowing in the second half around normal seasonal or?
Steve Sanghi: For the shipments are not linear. The visibility has improved. So, we have very strong backlog, the quarter is normal in terms of linearity. So, we are going to have no shipments in July and no shipments in August and all the shipments are in September. It is fairly linear and it is linear because the backlog is very healthy.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: To my last question, is around geographic break down of revenue. I understand it is where you ship not where the end product finally gets consumed, but if you had to take a guess of your exposure to Asia from a consumption standpoint. What would be the right ballpark to think?
Steve Sanghi: I don't have a number that I can backed by analysis. It will be just bring it out of the air.
Operator: Now we will go to Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.
Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak: Thank you for the follow through question. On the 16-bit 33% growth year-over-year, obviously impressive growth rate there, I don’t know if you can tell me what end markets, what products or what is driving that growth rate in your 16-bit?
Eric Bjornholt:  We never had particular end market strategy to drive growth. There is a lot of hard work that has gone in over the years to create the products to create the support infrastructure from both our own field sales team as well as our partners. It is a very broad range of customers and application that is driving that growth and we have consistently worked on the building the revenue pipeline, and what’s you are seeing is a fruits of hard work that have been done over many, many years to build it and we expect that to continue for a long time.
Brendan Furlong - Miller Tabak: I guess my last question. I know you probably not going to go there and just one, but. On your touch sensing you have 100-customer shipping in volume, any ballpark in terms of percentage of revenue or dollar value?
Eric Bjornholt: No, we don't break out by customer or market segment that way.
Operator: There are no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: We want to thank you everybody for attending the conference call and our apology again for some rough start especially on the webcast side. Hopefully you have the information you need and if you don't, just call us and we will give it to you. Thank you very much and we will see many of you on the road this quarter. Bye, bye.
Operator: This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2009 Q3  (2009-01-29 17:00:00) =====

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2009 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President, Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer, and Gordon Parnell. You all know Gordon from his position as CFO at Microchip, and we had previously told investors about his new role in business development. We have recently decided to add an Investor Relations function to Gordon’s activities, so he will support Eric and me in these efforts and you will continue to see Gordon at various conferences and investor meetings. With that I will pass the call to Eric Bjornholt.
Eric Bjornholt: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, and our 8-K reports that we have filed with the SEC, that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations. I will comment on the third quarter fiscal 2009 results, reviewing geographic data and discussing balance sheet and cash information. And Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment, discuss our internal plans for the March quarter, and update other pertinent matters regarding our business. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Net sales for the December quarter were $192.2 million, down approximately 28.8% from net sales of $269.7 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down approximately 23.9% from net sales of $252.6 million in the prior year’s first quarter. We are continuing to include information in our press release on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Non-GAAP results exclude share-based compensation expense, losses on trading securities, non-recurring tax events, and expenses associated with the acquisition of Hampshire Company. Earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.23 per diluted share in the December quarter, a decrease of 49.5% from $0.45 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter, and a decrease of 41.5% from $0.39 per diluted share in the prior year’s third quarter. GAAP earnings per share for the December quarter were $0.40 per diluted share. The after-tax impact on December quarterly earnings that have been excluded from our non-GAAP results include $6.7 million in share-based compensation expense, $11.9 million in losses from trading securities, and $51.3 million benefit from non-recurring tax events, and $0.8 million in expenses associated with the acquisition of Hampshire Company. Revenue was down significantly in all geographies. America’s revenues were down 21.3%, Europe was down 27.8%, and Asia was down 32.9%. Asia continues to be our largest geography representing approximately 45.8% of total sales. Revenues from Europe represent 28.1% of our business and the Americas is the balance of 26.1% of total sales. These measurements are based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes for our customers, but does not necessarily represent where the design activity is taking place, or where the end product consumption is occurring. I will now go through some of the operating results for the December quarter. I’m using gross margin and operating expense information prior to the effect of share based compensation and the acquisition related expenses. Gross margins were 55.2% in the December quarter compared to 61.6% in the September quarter. The quarterly reduction in gross profit margin was driven by cost related to reduce production levels of our manufacturing facilities being charged to cost of goods sold during the quarter. Total operating expenses were 29.4% of sales in the December quarter compared with the prior quarter which was 26.2% of sales. Research and development costs were $24 million representing 12.5% of sales. Sales in general and administrative expenses were $32.5 million representing 16.9% of sales. Operating expenses reduced by $14 million over the prior quarter level. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins, including shall-based compensation and amortization of acquisition related intangibles were 54.5%. Total operating expenses were $64.3 million or 33.5% of sales and includes share-based compensation and acquisition related expenses for in process R&D and amortization of acquisition related intangibles. On a non-GAAP basis, the tax rate for the December quarter was 17.8%. The GAAP effect of tax rate for the December quarter resulted in a benefit to our earnings, as it included a tax reserve releases of $33 million dollars associated with the clarification in tax regulations announced by the IRS in late December, a $16.9 million favorable settlement with the IRS, and a $1.5 million benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, adjustments for the losses on trading securities and acquisition related expenses. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of graphical profit on the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax-advantaged securities. The dividend declared today of $0.339 per share was an increase of approximately 5.9% over the same quarter in fiscal 2008. The dividend payment associated with this declared dividend would be approximately $62 million. Moving on to the balance sheet, inventory on Microchip’s books were $136.5 million, representing approximately 143 days as of the end of December. Deferred income on shipments to distributors were $98.4 million, down by $5.1 million from the balance of September. At December 31st, distributors were holding about 41 days of inventory. We are taking appropriate actions with our production levels to right size our manufacturing output and reduce inventories over time. At December 31, our receivables were $78.6 million, a decrease of $42.3 million or 35% from balances as at the end of September. We have not experienced any material deterioration in the payment performance from our customers and believe that our receivable balances are in good condition. We continue to closely monitor customer activity to ensure we are protecting the receivable assets on our balance sheet. Customer balances beyond terms continue to be at very low levels. As of the December 31st, Microchip’s cash and total investment positions was approximately $1,474 million, a decrease of $45 million from September. There were several significant factors driving the reduction in our cash and investment balance during the quarter associated with changes in working capital. Additionally, we recorded a $16 million reduction in the fair value of our trading securities which reduced our investment balance, and payments related to our cash dividend of $0.339 or $61.7 million. Capital spending was approximately $23.8 million for the December quarter. Depreciation expense for the December quarter was $23.2 million versus $23.4 million for the same quarter last fiscal year, and $23.9 million end of the September quarter. Our fiscal 2009 capital expenditures forecast is currently $106 million, a reduction of $9 million from previously anticipated levels, and the fiscal 2009 depreciation forecast is approximately $93.5 million. The capital expenditures forecast includes approximately $30 million related to the addition of new buildings in Thailand to support our assembly and test requirements, and a new building for our R&D and support operations in India. We have also reduced our capital expenditures budget for fiscal 2010 to $15 million, a reduction of 86% from fiscal 2009 levels. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now comment on the individual product line and let’s start with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was down 28% on a sequential basis and was down 23% from the year ago quarter. Flash microcontrollers now represent approximately 78.5% of our microcontroller business. In these difficult business conditions, we’re heartened by the innovation and ingenuity of our customers that enabled us to ship our 7 billionth cumulative microcontroller earlier this month, just 14 months after we shipped 6 billionth microcontroller. Against the backdrop of a challenging overall business environment, our 16-bit microcontroller business performed much better competitively. 16-bit revenue was only down 7% sequentially and was up 28% from the year ago quarter. New customers and new designs going into production helped offset most of the general market weakness experienced by older designs as the number of volume 16-bit customers grew approximately 2% sequentially to 1,670 customers. Our 32-bit microcontroller product line continues to make good progress. 18 products are now in production. Customer interest remains very high and we have a large number of designs incubating across a broad range of customers and applications. We expect the 32-bit product line to start contributing to our microcontroller revenue in fiscal year 2010. During the quarter, Microchip continued to make significant strides in establishing our leadership in the growing area of user interface solutions for the embedded market. In October, we completed the acquisition of Hampshire Company, a leader in the touch screen controller market, thus enabling us to address a broad range of new applications requiring touch screen control. We followed that in November with the introduction of the world’s first inductive touch sensing solution, which enables touch sense to be extended to a much broader range of applications where capacitive touch sense alone may not be suitable. Our inductive touch sense solution does complement and expand the leadership capacity of touch sensing solutions we introduced to the market almost 18 months ago. We are excited by the market interest, customer acceptance and design win momentum of our broad range of user interface solutions and their potential to drive growth. Moving to development tools, we shipped 32,799 development tools in the December quarter, the highest number of tools, we have ever shipped in a fiscal third-quarter, and up over 14% from the same quarter a year ago. Even in these challenging business conditions, we see no slowdown from our customers in their design in activities. We also shipped 3,758 16-bit development tools in the December quarter, bringing the total of 16-bit development tools shipped to date to over 57,000. Moving to our analog products, our analog business was down 23% sequentially, and was down 5% from the year ago quarter, and while market conditions were difficult, we continued to introduce several innovative new products and we are encouraged by the strength in overall customer design in activity. And then on to the serial E squared memory products, this business was down 38% sequentially. Although market conditions were challenging, we continue to run this business in a disciplined fashion that keeps it profitable.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments and our guidance for the March quarter. Steve?:
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon everyone, again. Today I would like to first reflect on the results of the December quarter, then I will talk about our internal plan for the March 2009 quarter. The December quarter was the most difficult quarter ever in the history of our company. It was a quarter that the industry and I would like to forget. With the onset of the global financial crisis, the business environment deteriorated rapidly, the bookings and visibility dropped precipitously. As you saw, any company who gave any kind of guidance last quarter then had to revise their guidance a few weeks later. In response to the worsening business environment, Microchip implemented a series of cost and capital containment measures. First, we implemented a shutdown in both of our fabs at the end of the quarter. We reduced our production level by 20% from the peak utilization in September 2008 quarter. Second, we implemented a company wide pay cut and eliminated all bonuses and substantially reduced discretionary expenses. And third, we cancelled and pushed out a significant amount of capital that had been ordered for growth. Despite taking all these actions, we saw a significant increase in our inventory in days of sales. This is because our actions to cut production were somewhat negated by our distributors and customers continuing to reduce inventories in response to their business falling off dramatically. At the end, we still have high inventory at Microchip as well as our distributors, and it will take a couple of quarters to burn this inventory up. Meanwhile, Microchip will continue to run its fab at reduced levels. From the last quarter’s level, we have reduced manufacturing substantially more, and currently our fabs are running at 40% below their peak levels of our September 2008 quarter. The December quarter put a damper on what was otherwise shaping to be a very good year for Microchip in 2008. Our revenue in March, June and September 2008 quarters increased by 3%, 3% and 1% respectively. So we grew every quarter. In microcontrollers, we shipped a record number of development tools in all three quarters, and achieved record sales in microcontrollers in the September 2008 quarter. We also shipped to record sales on 16-bit microcontrollers with a growth of 12%, 5% and 17% in the first three calendar quarters of last year. We also achieved a growth of 8%, 3% and 12% in analog in the first three quarters of calendar 2008. Our 32-bit microcontroller products achieved six different awards from a variety of international publications in 2008. We also shipped over 16,000 development tools, surpassing the rate of tools shipped for 16-bit microcontrollers at the same stage. So by September quarter, we had achieved our highest manufacturing efficiencies, resulting in our lowest ever wafer cost, highest ever non-GAAP gross margin of 61.6%, and a record non-GAAP earnings per share. So during the year, through the September quarter, we had delivered on our operational goals in nearly all elements of our business. This disciplined execution remains an important strength for Microchip. But the response could now be, what have you done for me lately? Enter the December quarter, and it all got washed away. The only product line that turned in respectable performance in the December quarter was the 16-bit microcontroller. As Ganesh pointed out, 16-bit microcontrollers were down 7% sequentially and up 28% from the year ago quarter. Given the steep decline in industry revenue, our 16-bit performance shows the inherent momentum in that product line. The backlog for 16-bit microcontrollers for March quarter is higher than what we saw in the December quarter. And if that trend continues, we are cautiously optimistic in expecting flat to some revenue growth in this product line in the March quarter. We believe that the best way to successfully emerge from this recession is with new products. We will continue our pace of investments in R&D while maintaining our employees on a pay cut to reduce operating expenses. In 2009, we will have approximately 150 new a 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit analog products come to market that will offer superior value for our customers. These new products will set the standard for ultra low power consumption and they will expand and extend our broad base of embedded control solutions, especially for the energy efficiency, for the green products, the user interface for touch and graphics, and intelligent sensor markets. We believe that we will continue to gain market share in all of our strategic product lines. Now I will discuss our internal plan for the March quarter. The semiconductor industry is still suffering from the global financial crisis. You have seen the March quarter guidance from several semiconductor manufacturers. They are all seeing weak bookings and substantial concerns in the economy. The story at Microchip is not very different in that respect. Our book to bill ratio for the December quarter was 0.7. We have the lowest backlog and visibility in a very long time entering a quarter. But on the other hand, we have seen our total backlog bottom out, and it has been on a slightly increasing slope for the last three weeks. We have a large number of customers expediting product because they may have taken inventory levels too low during the correction last quarter. Having said that, the bookings in January are still on the weak side. Such reduced visibility is making revenue determination very challenging. With that backdrop we are not able to provide guidance for the March quarter. We have set our internal plan for revenue for the March quarter at $173 million or down about 10% sequentially. Our internal plan for non-GAAP gross margin is about 50%. Our non-GAAP earnings per share internal plan is $0.13 to $0.15. Our GAAP earnings per share plan is $0.09 to $0.11. Since Microchip owns public securities which are subject to mark to market considerations, we have assumed zero mark to market adjustments. With such deep declines in revenue across the industry, even leading semiconductor companies are forecasting a loss for the March quarter. We take some consolation in the fact that our business model is working and is profitable even in such dire industry conditions. We have been profitable for 73 consecutive quarters and the March quarter will be our 74th. We continue to receive questions from investors and analysts about Microchip’s dividend. We have said repeatedly that the Board Of Directors of Microchip is committed to maintaining the current dividend. Despite unprecedented weak business conditions, Microchip’s business is very profitable. Even in the face of extremely difficult conditions in the December quarter, we generated positive cash flow from operations and we returned to substantially higher generation of free cash flow from operations moving forward. Once we get past the March quarter, the inventory will start to come down and the capital expense will drop precipitously, expected only $15 million of fiscal year 2010, then Microchip’s cash flow becomes very healthy again and able to support the dividend. Meanwhile, we are committed to maintaining the dividend by using a portion of our very healthy cash reserves. With that said, would you please poll for questions?
Operator: Certainly. (Operator instructions). And our first question today will come from Romit Shah with Barclays Capital.
Romit Shah – Barclays Capital: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, there is a number of companies that a couple of quarters ago had similar margins, but today are in the red. Given the adjustments you have made to lower capacity and reduce expenses, can you give us a sense of what cash breakeven might be for Microchip?
Steve Sanghi: Cash flow breakeven?
Romit Shah – Barclays Capital: Yes.
Steve Sanghi: Or operating profit breakeven, which one?
Romit Shah – Barclays Capital: Either one is fine.
Steve Sanghi: I don’t know if we have either of them. We are so profitable if you look at the numbers that the gross margin we talked about, internal plan is about 50% gross margin, substantial deterioration from the peak. But this is sort of where it bottoms. And you should see gross margins starting to inch up from starting the June quarter and operating expenses are in low 30s. So the company’s still very, very profitable, and you have to go way, way down in revenue to the point where I couldn’t fathom for the company to actually go below breakeven and start losing money. In any such eventuality, we will further cut manufacturing and expenses and all that much deeper, so I don’t think we will even get close to it.
Romit Shah – Barclays Capital: Okay. And as an follow up, you guys have talked I think in the last quarter or so about acquisitions as a potential use of cash, and if these acquisitions are to go through, do you think you’ll be able to still support the dividend?
Steve Sanghi: The answer to that is yes. I mean we have modeled it, there is no scenario we have put together internally where it becomes not possible for us to pay the dividend. We wouldn’t take any actions which would make that a problem.
Romit Shah – Barclays Capital: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Okay. Now we will hear from Chris Danely with JPMorgan.
Chris Danely – JPMorgan: Thanks. Steve, I guess you give us your rough guidance for sort of OpEx and gross margins for the March quarter. Assuming an extremely gradual stabilization/recovery for the rest of the year, how do you expect your OpEx and gross margins to trend after the March quarter?
Steve Sanghi: We have designed our overall compensation system and OpEx to be of a highly variable nature. I mean it’s in our book, chapter 6, if you want to get more details.
Chris Danely – JPMorgan: I read it.
Steve Sanghi: Last quarter our OpEx went down 20%. I am not seeing a lot of other companies being able to cut OpEx 20% so rapidly with revenue deteriorating, and with the knife falling so fast. I have seen numbers in the 10%, 12%, 15% range. Our OpEx was down 20%, and we will go down more this quarter. So essentially, we are preparing on both sides of the spectrum. On one hand, we are prepared if this recession is long, goes all year or longer, conditions continue to be very, very difficult. We can maintain operating expense very low, keep manufacturing very low, and really continue to lower the inventory. On the other hand, we are seeing our backlog bottom out as I mentioned. Backlog is starting to grow, customers are expediting products, some of their inventories have gone so low, so we are cautiously optimistic there. So in either scenario, I think we are positioning the company very well.
Chris Danely – JPMorgan: So I guess Steve, if business remains sort of sluggish, can you keep OpEx flattish after this quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, flattish or even lower.
Chris Danely – JPMorgan: Okay great. And then as my follow-up, can you just talk about, if you guys have a goal for inventory, or when you think your utilization rates will bottom out?
Steve Sanghi: Utilization rates basically depend on the revenue outlook. So with the current revenue internal plan, we believe utilization bottomed sort of where we are. We are running the fabs at 40% lower from the peak level, so call it 60% from where we were at the top. And with that, even with – you have to look at the inventory total, Microchip plus distributors. Because we don’t really know what the distributors will do, and in reality that total inventory, our plus distributors, really serves our customers. That total inventory will decline substantially this quarter, and we are – we can maintain the utilization at that rate. And even if the revenue stays flat going forward, the inventory will drop quite significantly. If the revenue has some increase in the next quarter and the second half, then the inventory will even drop faster.
Chris Danely – JPMorgan: Can you give us an estimate of, let’s just say it’s flat, how much inventory would drop, or Eric can you take a stab at that?
Eric Bjornholt: 11 [ph].
Chris Danely – JPMorgan: Okay, that is fine.
Operator: Our next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan.
Harsh Kumar – Morgan Keegan: 
Hi guys. Two quick questions. First of all, Steve, your guidance of 10% down, roughly is a lot better than what we are hearing from some of the other guys, down 15% to 20%. You’re also saying that the distri are reducing inventories, and your sales out. So should we think of demand the way you’re viewing demand to be better than 10%, is that what our take-away should be?: 
Steve Sanghi: 
Well, it often is the case whenever business is going down, usually it goes down lower than the real consumption level. That is the only way to really deplete the inventories out there, so I’m sure that is true. However, with a large number of customers, huge number of distributors, multiple geographies, not completely lined up week by week, and it is sort of kind of very hard to see.: 
So our – we did this modeling by extensive consultation with our distributors, customers, all of our sales regions, going through our normal processes, and we did that last quarter also. But you can see that in this environment, customers don’t know. In October, when we gave the guidance, customers told us what they were going to do, and then just three weeks later, customers were shutting down their factories for two weeks, three weeks, and pushing out backlog.: 
So the inputs can be very unreliable. So we took the inputs again, we added a substantial amount of judgment. We’re running this thing conservatively, and we realized that our 10% is substantially better than what we’re hearing from the competitors. And I guess time would tell either we’re gaining share or our mix is better or we took an uglier fall, because our markets in housing and all that bottomed out earlier versus other companies in PCs and cell phones and all that are seeing the correction now.: 
So I can kind of tell it back to a number of people blamed us to be losing market share. And I think as you compile the numbers now, you can really see that over two quarters, we seem to be doing better than pretty much everybody.: 
Harsh Kumar – Morgan Keegan: 
I appreciate the color, Steve. Just one more question, switching gears a little bit, longer-term strategic question. You have got a pretty commanding share in the 8-bit micro controller globally, is it fair for us to assume that there’s not a lot of market share left for you to gain in 8-bit, that you’d probably go with the market, any color would be helpful, Steve?: 
Steve Sanghi: 
Yes. Ganesh, answer that.: 
Ganesh Moorthy: 
Okay. We expect and we will continue to gain market share. We are in the 15%, 16% share of the overall market. There’s a lot more to be had.: 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joanne Feeney with FTN.
Joanne Feeney – FTN: I was hoping maybe you could shed some light, I know it’s (inaudible) you guys to see which end markets are doing relatively well. But just searching from your conversations with your customers, can you perhaps contrast for us how things are going in the consumer versus computing versus industrial areas?
Steve Sanghi: Well, in real honesty, no markets are doing well. Having said that, the housing section really burnt out much earlier. So later on when the crisis spread from housing to banks and then to the consumers and others, you saw significant impact on PCs and cell phones and consumer electronics. Consumer is really very misunderstood word in a way, there’s consumer electronics, and there is consumer, which looks more like industrial, thermostats and sprinklers and appliances and housing and all that. We are in that. We are left in the consumer electronics which are cell phones and toys and entertainment equipment and iPods and other stuff. So the consumer industrial type busted earlier and that’s why we took the fall from the housing earlier. And then what you are seeing now is a substantial drop. Some of the companies are down 50%, 40% to 50% over two quarters, which are much more exposed to the consumer electronics as well as PCs and cell phones.
Joanne Feeney – FTN: Are you at all sort of concerned or rethinking given the data that came out today for the housing industry? Not today, yesterday rather.
Steve Sanghi: No. The numbers have been so low that it isn’t – we are not seeing it really having a major further – there is no place to go down.
Joanne Feeney – FTN: Okay. And then if you could just for a second –
Steve Sanghi: Inventory of homes sold change on a daily basis. Definitely, what drives it is really, in the housing market, there is refurbishment and there are new stuff bought. 60% to 70% of our appliance sales are actually to existing consumers changing their washer or drier or air conditioner or whatever, and 30%, 35% are new going to the newer houses. The newer houses have gone to almost nothing and the business was down by that much percentage. Rest is refurbishment, so there is not a whole lot lower to go from there.
Joanne Feeney – FTN: Okay. And then just one question on the gross margin, on the newer 16-bit effort, are those gross margins higher than sort of your average in 8-bit, can you let us know whether that change in mix might be pushing your margins up over the longer term?
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: You know the – think of microcontrollers as kind of an overall segment, and the margins within them across the product lines are very similar, the gross margins are. The absolute margins change by the ASP of the products, but the gross margin percentage is really roughly the same across 8, 16, and eventually as we get into volume in 32-bit as well.
Joanne Feeney – FTN: Okay, great. Thanks
Operator: (Operator instructions). Our next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
Shroff – Credit Suisse: Hi. This is actually Shroff [ph] for John Pitzer. Thanks for taking our question. Any update or thoughts you can share with regards to any potential transactions with regards to Atmel, Steve?
Steve Sanghi: There is nothing to say. There is absolutely nothing to say and you are representing the other side. Next question please.
Shroff – Credit Suisse: My second question would be with regards to the Hampshire acquisition and extension into the touch screen technology, could you update us on which end markets you are most focused on and when you might see the first products being introduced?
Steve Sanghi: That will be answered, Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, Hampshire already had a set of product lines and they were shipping into certain customers. They are predominantly targeted at the industrial segments, where there is touch screen requirements there. And there is a little bit of it that goes into things like restaurant terminals and that kind of stuff. So it is not something that is waiting for some work to be done for revenue generation, it is already in revenue, although it is small in it size. And primarily it is not waiting on a consumer electronics boom, it’s really aimed at the – primarily at the industrial control end of things. It has lots of opportunities we believe in some of the other market segments, and that is part of what Microchip will do is develop and take that technology into these newer segments where we have channel and other coverage capabilities.
Operator: Moving on, we will hear from Gill Alexander [ph] with Douglas Associates [ph].
Steve Sanghi: Hello, Gill.
Gill Alexander – Douglas Associates: Good evening. Could you give us any guess, and you may have mentioned it, what your tax rate could be next year? The range?
Steve Sanghi: Yes.
Eric Bjornholt: Our tax rate will be approximately 15% in that range, somewhere in that 13% to 16%.
Gill Alexander – Douglas Associates: And if you look at the 8-bit field controllable market, what percentage of that market do you have?
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: It has been in the 30s, I would guess about the mid 30s or so, of the programmable segment is where Microchip has our share at.
Gill Alexander – Douglas Associates: Thank you very much.
Operator: We’ll now hear from Steve Eliscu with UBS.
Steve Eliscu – UBS: Yes. This is Steve Eliscu for Uche Orji. First question regarding underutilization charges, when you get to the point where you are no longer incurring that, should we expect some sort of snapback in gross margin back up to somewhere in the 55% neighborhood? Or I think Steve you mentioned about a more gradual change, how are you thinking about that right now?
Steve Sanghi: Well, so the quarter in which we increased production from the current utilization is the quarter you immediately see a bounce back in gross margin. How much you see depends on where you take it. If the demand is so strong and distributors are rebuilding inventory and all that, that you take it immediately from 60 to 100, the bounce back would be very, very dramatic. That is unlikely to happen. So, it just depends on where will our take would be in terms of internal plans for revenue, and based on that, we will set the internal production to that level, and there will be an appropriate bounce back in the gross margin.
Steve Eliscu – UBS: Okay, that is helpful. With regards to the touch area, you talked about inductive touch, you talked about the touch screens with the Hampshire Company, how are you thinking in terms of as a percentage of overall growth that you're getting from touch, the inductive piece and the touch screen, are those going to contribute in a major way to the overall touch growth?
Steve Sanghi: We never break that out. Why would we want to tell anybody how successful we are being into any other area, and that is either attracting competition in our investment or whatever. So that is just too detailed of a breakdown.
Steve Eliscu – UBS: Yes, I was just looking qualitative. I guess – okay, that is fine. One last question, just based on your guidance, it seems like you're looking for essentially zero interest income, if I did the math right, is that the right way to think about it, the interest and other?
Steve Sanghi: No, I don't think so.
Eric Bjornholt: No, that is not correct. We're still earning interest income.
Steve Eliscu – UBS: Can you give a range that might be helpful there?
Eric Bjornholt: Yes. So I think maybe what you’re thinking is, on the interest income line, we are earning income that we have interest expense associated with our convertible debt, which is about $6.3 million per quarter. So I guess we look at the net of those, it is a very small number.
Steve Eliscu – UBS: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.
Brendan Furlong – Miller Tabak: Good afternoon gentlemen. How are you doing? A quick question on 16- bit, I don’t know if you can offer some color on fiscal year 2010. Obviously you are growing 8-bit this quarter, what are your thoughts going forward on 16?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's been growing very strongly. We expect it to continue to grow well into fiscal year 2010. It is obviously growing a lot faster than Microchip average, and that trend is not abating. We expect it to do very well in fiscal year 2010.
Brendan Furlong – Miller Tabak: And my second question would be one of your private equity competitors seems to be under a little bit of stress, do you think that's offered some benefits in the next couple of years, well next year, I would say?
Steve Sanghi: It's been benefiting us for the last ten years, we'll continue to benefit.
Brendan Furlong – Miller Tabak: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And it appears at this point that we have no further questions. Gentlemen, I'll turn the call back over to you for additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Okay. We will be seeing many of you at conferences we go to this quarter. Which is the next one?
Eric Bjornholt: Thomas Weisel Conference.
Steve Sanghi: Thomas Weisel Conference coming up, so we will see some of you on the road. Thank you very much. Bye, bye.
Operator: Once again that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful afternoon.

===== 2009 Q2  (2008-10-23 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Steve Sanghi - President and CEO Gordon Parnell - CFO Ganesh Moorthy - EVP Eric Bjornholt - VP of Finance
Analysts: Doug Freedman - American Technology Research John Pitzer - Credit Suisse John Barton - Cowen & company Chris Danely - JPMorgan Harsh Kumar - Morgan Keegan Ray Rund - Shaker Investments Uche Orji - UBS Craig Ellis - Citi Romit Shah - Barclays Capital Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs
Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology fourth quarter fiscal year 2008 financial results conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip Technology's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, [Jerril]. Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, and our 8-K current reports that we have filed with the SEC, that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Gordon Parnell, Chief Financial Officer, Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President, and Eric Bjornholt, Vice President of Finance. During the quarter, we, together with ON Semiconductor, made an offer to purchase Atmel Corporation for $5 per share. In this transaction, Microchip will sell the nonvolatile memory, RF, and auto business segments of Atmel to ON Semiconductor. Microchip also intends to sell the ASIC business segment to a third-party. Microchip will therefore keep the microcontroller business segment of Atmel. As of this conference call, we have not received a response from Atmel, either publicly or privately. Microchip is very committed to completing this transaction, and will keep all of its options open based on Atmel’s response.  We announced the retirement of Gordon Parnell, and appointment of Eric Bjornholt as a Chief Financial Officer, effecting the beginning of calendar 2009. This transition of CFO will continue as scheduled. However, Gordon Parnell has decided to stay with Microchip, and has accepted a newly created position as Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions, reporting directly to me.  Disappointment will extend to Microchip's management bandwidth as we take on the Atmel acquisition to which we remain extremely committed. I would like to thank Gordon Parnell for his excellent financial stewardship of Microchip during which he built significant trust with investors and analysts. I also want to thank Gordon for accepting the new position of Vice President of M&A. His experience and background at Microchip will be of tremendous advantage in this role. I also thank Gordon for training his replacement, Eric Bjornholt, and I look forward to working with Eric. And now, I will pass this call to Gordon Parnell.
Gordon Parnell: Thanks, Steve. I am very pleased to be staying with Microchip and very excited about my new responsibilities and hope to continue to deliver significant value to the business, to my focus in these areas. Let's get on with the call information today. Eric and I are going to be commenting on our second quarter fiscal year 2009 results. We will review geographic data, discuss our balance sheet, and cash information, and Steve and Ganesh will also give their comments on the results and outline our guidance for the December quarter and update other matters that are pertinent to our business. The four of us will then be available to respond to any specific investor and analyst questions. Our net sales for the September quarter were at record levels $269.7 million, up approximately 0.6% from the sales of $268.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up approximately 4.3% from net sales of $258.6 million in the prior year's first quarter. In earnings per share, we are continuing to include additional information in our press release related to share-based compensation, SFAS 123(R). Our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of the adoption of this accounting standard and also a charge related to the sale of Fab 3, which was in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Our earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were a record $0.45 per diluted share, an increase of 2.7% from $0.44 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter and an increase of 18.8% from $0.38 per diluted share in the prior year's second quarter. GAAP earnings per share in the September quarter were $0.41 per diluted share, inclusive of all share-based compensation expenses, and the impact on earnings related to share-based compensation was approximately 8.3%. Geographically, Asia’s revenues were up sequentially, while both Americas and Europe were down in the September quarter. Asia continues to improve their revenues effectively in the September quarter, growing 6.3% sequentially, while the Americas and Europe were impacted by economic and seasonal factors in both territories, resulting in those regions being down sequentially, 2.3% and 6.2% respectively. Asia continues to be the largest geography for Microchip, representing approximately 48.9% of total sales. Europe represents 27.1% of sales and the Americas approximately 24% of sales. This measurement is based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes for our customer's needs, but does not necessarily represent where the design activity is taking place, or where the consumption is occurring. Operating P&L levels, as I mentioned, FAS 123R expenses are excluded from our non-GAAP Information, and this is initially where I will report. Our gross margins were 61.62% in the September quarter, establishing new record levels. Our total operating expenses were 26.2% of sales, compared with the prior quarter, which was 26.4%. Research and development costs were $28.7 million representing 10.6% of sales. Sales and general administrative expenses were $41.8 million, representing 15.5% of sales. Both the areas of operating expenses made modest improvements compared to the prior quarter. On a full GAAP our gross margins including the share based compensation, were 60.9%, and total operating expenses were $77 million, or 28.5% of sales. The tax rate for the September quarter was 18.1%, both on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and the percentage of cash that is invested in tax advantage securities. The dividend that we declared today, of $33.09 per share, was an increase of approximately 9.4% over the same quarter in fiscal 2008. And the dividend payment associated with this declared dividend will be approximately $62 million that will be paid out in the current quarter. I will ask Eric to walk you through the balance sheet information for the September quarter, and other related items. Eric.
Eric Bjornholt: Thanks, Gordon. I have been very fortunate to work with Gordon Parnell over the past 13 years, and I'm honored to follow in his footsteps and become Microchip Technology's CFO in January. I also appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's call, and I am looking forward to meeting many of you in coming months. I will be reviewing some of Microchip Technology's key metrics today. Inventories on Microchip Technology's balance sheet were $126.8 million representing approximately a 110 days after the end of September. Deferred income on shipments to distributors was $103.5 million, up by $6.4 million from the balance in June. At September 30th, distributors were holding 35 days of inventory. The combined inventory in our balance sheets and our distributor’s represents a 145 days of total inventory, similar to the inventory levels as of the end of fiscal 2008. At September 30th our receivables were a $120.9 million, a decrease of $14.9 million or 10.8% from balances as at the end of June. The reduction of receivables reflects excellent collections performance with shipment linearity in the quarter. Customer balances beyond terms are at very low levels. As of September 30th, Microchip’s cash and total investment position was approximately $1.519 billion. During the quarter, Microchip generated net cash flow from the business of approximately $129.4 million. Payments related to our cash dividends of $33.08, were $62.2 million and the cash in our stock buyback activity was approximately $100.3 million. We anticipate building approximately $85 million to $95 million in operational cash in the December quarter prior to dividends and stock buyback activity. Capital spending was approximately $46.3 million for the September quarter. Depreciation expense for the September quarter was $23.9 million versus $25.4 million for the same quarter last fiscal year, and $23.2 million in the June quarter. Our capital expenditures forecast is currently $115 million, and appreciation forecast is approximately $95 million for fiscal 2009. The capital expenditures forecast includes approximately $35 million, relating to the addition of a new building in Thailand, in support of our assembly and test requirements, and a new building for R&D and support operations in India. I will now, ask for Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now comment on the individual product lines. Let’s start with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was essentially flat on a sequential basis and was up over 5.5% from the year-ago quarter. Our flash Micro controller business meanwhile hit another record and was up over 2% on a sequential basis, and up 14% from the year-ago quarter Flash microcontrollers now represent over 77% of our micro controller business. We are on pace to ship over 1 billion microcontrollers in calendar 2008 and expect the 7 billionth cumulative microcontrollers shipment to occur sometime in December of this year. Moving to development tools shipped, we had another record quarter with 35,282 development tools that were shipped in the quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of record development tool shipments, and we also shipped our 700,000 cumulative development tools in the quarter. Both of these milestones are indicative of continued strong design and activity, and acceptance of our solutions. That should bode well for future growth. Our 16-bit microcontroller business had another good quarter and achieved record revenue as well. Revenue was up approximately 17% sequentially and up 76% from the year-ago quarter. We shipped 5,069 16-bit development tools in the September quarter, bringing the total 16-bit development tools shipped to-date to 53,310. The revenue growth and the development tool shipments results reflect our continued strong design win momentum across the broad range of customers and application, and the number of volumes, 16-bit customers, grew by approximately 15% sequentially to 1,641 in the September quarter. Our 32-bit microcontroller product line continues to make good progress. We now have 17 products in production. Customer interest remains very high and we have a large number of 32-bit designs that are incubating across a broad range of customers and applications. Revenue shipments commence to several of our early adapter customers although the revenues still small at this stage of the product line. While we know the design in cycles for most 32-bit customers will be long, we are optimistic about the product line's contribution to our overall microcontroller growth and leadership position. Moving to our analog products, the analog business was up approximately 12% sequentially, and was up approximately 21% from the year-ago quarter, achieving another record quarter for revenue. The strength in our analog business reflects the results of a three-pronged strategy we embarked on several years ago. First, it was to attach to Microchip microcontrollers, and this has been amplified by the greater analog content we find and in our more advanced 8, 16 and 32 bit microcontrollers. Second, was to attach the microcontrollers from other suppliers, which also gives us the beech head in those applications to win without microcontrollers in the future. And third was to win, wherever analog is required, attaching to FPGAs, DSPs, and ASICs etcetera. The investment in expanding our sales force over the last few years, as well as our focus on providing lower power products, the super specifications and short lead times, continues to attract new customers to Microchip for our analog solutions. This is reflected in the number of customers buying our analog products over the last 12 months having grown by 10%, to 14,080 customers. On serial EEPROM, our serial EEPROM business was down approximately 2% sequentially, and the pricing declined moderately quarter-over-quarter. Last week we announced the acquisition of Hampshire Company, a leader in the touch screen controller market. Microchip already has very strong market momentum with our mTouch sensing product portfolio. Hampshire’s touch screen product portfolio enabled us to extend this momentum and offer our customers a broader range of industry leading user interface solutions. We are excited about the possibilities we see in applying Microchip scale and geographic reach to exploit the full potential of Hampshire’s product portfolio. Let me now pass it to Steve, for some general comments and our guidance for the December quarter. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon again. Today I would like to first reflect on the results of the September quarter, then I will provide guidance for the December 2008 quarter. I am very pleased with our execution in the September quarter amidst one of the most challenging business environments that we have seen. Despite this environment, we made new records in the net sales, gross margin, and non-GAAP earnings per share. It was also very pleasing to see that we achieved strong growth in all of our strategic product lines, with 16-bit microcontrollers, flash microcontrollers, and analog all making new records. We also shipped a record number of development tools for the fourth quarter in result providing evidence of continued strong design momentum on our products. During the quarter, we also saw some continuing investor concerns about China during and after Olympics. We completed the quarter with a record sales in China, which were up 10.7% sequentially. Now I will discuss the guidance for the December quarter. By this time, you have seen the December quarter guidance from several semiconductor manufacturers, and large multinational electronics distributors. They are all seeing weak bookings and substantial concerns in the economy due to financial crisis and credit crunch. The story at Microchip is not very different in that respect. Our book-to-bill ratio for September quarter was 0.93. Our starting backlog for the December quarter was significantly lower than our starting backlog for the September quarter. We have seen week bookings so far in October. It seems that customers and distributors are frozen in their tracks, and do not want to release orders. The business situation is extremely difficult, with liquidity and credit issues reducing visibility, making revenue determination very challenging. With that backdrop, and after our internal and customer facing review processes, we expect our net sales for December quarter to be down 8% to 16% sequentially. With such a large drop in sequential revenue, we expect our inventory to grow substantially. To keep this inventory growth from spinning out of control, Microchip will implement a two week shutdown in our fab facilities at the end of this quarter. We will also implement a one week shutdown in our assembly and test facility in Thailand. We will also ask all employees to take one week off unpaid during the balance of this quarter. We needed this revenue guidance to get into the public domain, so that we can take the information deeper to our employees, factories and suppliers. Our track record of managing gross margin impact and cutting operating expenses during prior recessions has been very good. We again expect to be able to mitigate the impact in gross margin percentage and cut some of the operating expenses, including cutting bonuses, freezing new hiring, taking some attrition and reducing all other discretionary expenses. By taking all such actions, we expect to achieve a non-GAAP gross margin percentage between 59%, and 60%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between 26%, and 27%. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $0.35, and $0.41. I also want to assure investors that Microchip will maintain its commitments to dividends. Despite sharp decrease in revenue, we expect to generate approximately $85 million to $95 million in free cash flow this quarter. Our dividend is fully supported by the operational cash flow generation. We are not able to provide complete GAAP guidance because the impact of the acquisition of Hampshire Company on our GAAP financial is subject to a purchase price allocation which is not complete yet. I recently read a T.J. Rodgers paper on the issues with GAAP accounting with interest and I find myself completely in agreement with T.J., therefore I will provide GAAP guidance without the impact of the acquisition. GAAP gross margins are expected to be about 70 basis points lower than non-GAAP. GAAP earnings per share are expected to be about $0.04 and $0.05 lower than non-GAAP earnings per share. The acquisition of Hampshire Company is expected to be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings per share. With that, Jill, would you please poll for questions? 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question today is from Doug Freedman with American Technology Research.
Doug Freedman - American Technology Research: Hi Steve. Thanks so much for taking my question. Clearly it is a tough environment out there. Can you give us any color on where you see turns for the quarter? How are you managing? Whether you are seeing any pockets of inventory? It appears we are trying to pull down production at the same rate as demand is coming in. Do you think you are doing a good job of balancing that?
Steve Sanghi: I look at this as a more of a demand destruction and inventory correction. Although any time you have reduction in demand, then any inventory anybody has appears multiplied and it looks like more inventory than they need. But the cause of that is not high inventory anywhere at our customers or channels. The starting point from this is really reduction in demand because of credit and other financial economic issues. We are managing it realtime and have taken swift action to allow reduction in our expenses, reduction in all sorts of discretionary travel and other expenses, and to reduce the inventory build by scheduling a two-week shutdown in our factories here in fab, and all the other actions I described.
Doug Freedman - American Technology Research: Thank you so much.
Steve Sanghi: You're welcome.
Operator: And our second question is from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Good afternoon, Steve. I appreciate your taking the question. Given how volatile the environment is with your own business, how comfortable are you with able to making a good evaluation assessment on the Atmel acquisition? If your partner ON were to pull out of the acquisition, would you still be committed to moving ahead with it?
Steve Sanghi: Regarding Atmel, we have tracked them for a long time and understand their business. We are in several of those businesses like microcontroller and eSCORE. We have not been provided any due diligence so far to really be able to confirm our assumptions and we are hoping for Atmel to come to us and want to get into meaningful negotiations and provide us some due diligence, which they have not been able to. While this environment is rapidly changing, we believe the Atmel acquisition is a long-term opportunity to build value for our shareholders, and it will take several months for us to acquire, even if it turned friendly tomorrow. So, I think the short-term severe reduction in demand that we are seeing is really not meaningful in terms of analyzing the Atmel acquisition. The second part of your question was what would happen if ON were to pull out. ON has headquarters here locally in Phoenix and I meet with them all the time including a meeting just two days ago and ON is fully committed to this acquisition. They are making good progress in lining up financing and we believe that both of us are jointly committed. We are also making a very, very good progress and at this point have several options for interested parties for the ASICs business.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Okay, thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Okay.
Operator: And our next question is from John Barton with Cowen & company.
John Barton - Cowen & company: Thank you very much. You’ve made comments about cutting down the fab production by shutting down for two weeks at the end of the quarter. If that addresses this quarter and making the assumptions, its going to be a level loading until that point. If we continue to see weakness into the March quarter, how would you address it at that point?
Steve Sanghi:  I think to go back to is, we have seen these environments before. Here history back in 2001 at the tech bust, we had a significant demand reduction like this right after events in 2003. We saw some impact in 97, due to the Asian financial crisis. So, the history could be a judge. We have short-term impact, which we managed through these shutdowns, and some time reparative one it could be done in subsequent quarters also, but eventually with strong proprietary business model, underlying substantial growth in 16-bit microcontrollers and merging 32-bit, strong growth on the high-end of 8-bit microcontrollers, analog and others. We always bounce back and we always have in the past and there is no doubt in anybody's mind that we will, we shipped a record number of development tools last quarter. As I have said before, nobody buys these tools to play games on them. All you can do is design with the products. So, design wins momentum and the demand creation efforts continue unabated. It's just that the customers are buying less products short-term because their own concerns about liquidity, credits and other things and temporarily they’re like deer in the headlights; they’re stopped in their tracks and not releasing orders. We don't really believe that such a deep drop in revenue is really sustainable over the long term.
Gordon Parnell: Just another reminder for investors maybe some of you may know have a history with Microchip. But as we managed through these various events in the industry, with the proprietary products mix due to the long lived nature of our products, we do not take obsolescence. We don’t have obsolescence problems with this period. We manage it upfront similarly to what we're doing to-date, but we haven't seen any impact from that side of a business and anticipate that we can manage this event just as effectively.
John Barton - Cowen & company: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question is from Chris Danely with JPMorgan.
Chris Danely - JPMorgan: Thanks, guys. To follow up on John's question. Assuming this tough environment does extend to the March quarter, and we do have another down quarter, can we expect you to trying to hold OpEx flat and gross margins flat? What would happen to your inventory in that case?
Gordon Parnell: First of all, we wouldn't today expect the March quarter to be down. I think after such a steep drop, usually there is some sort of bounce because it always drops too far. Also, we have shown that a number of times with after drop following quarter is moderated, but taking a question, if that were to happen, then we will address that question at that time. Doing another shutdown or reduce starts or take some other actions to cut expenses and keep the draconian actions we are implementing in terms of discretionary spending cut and pay freeze and all those types of actions will have to continue longer or maybe even deeper.
Chris Danely - JPMorgan: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan.
Harsh Kumar - Morgan Keegan: Hi, Steve, can you talk about the timeframe on Atmel acquisition; obviously it doesn't look like the Board is coming back to you, so how long are you prepared to wait and what happens next? 
Steve Sanghi: Hello Harsh. That question you should be asking Atmel. Right now the ball is in their court. We made an offer and we need a response, we have not received it. We may receive it along with their earnings release possibly next week and we may receive it tomorrow and we may not receive it even next week; we don't know. But next step is theirs and if the response is not coming in due course, then with the help of our advisers we will frame the next steps and we have several options. 
Harsh Kumar - Morgan Keegan: Steve, if you don't mind giving us a picture by end markets, maybe which were some of your end markets that were worst hit and if there were any bright spots at all?
Steve Sanghi: We have really no end market commentary. We serve a very, very broad end markets with over 63,000 customers and have really do not give any end market breakdown anymore.
Harsh Kumar - Morgan Keegan:  Thanks, and Gordon, congratulations on your new position.
Gordon Parnell: Thanks Harsh.
Operator: And your next question is from Ray Rund with Shaker Investments. 
Ray Rund - Shaker Investments: Thank you for taking my question. Steve, given that you have announced your intention or at least desire to purchase Atmel and you name a price, is there anything that stops you from buying Atmel stock at the current market price?
Steve Sanghi: First of all, welcome back, Ray. That’s a sign that stocks may have gone low enough
Ray Rund - Shaker Investments: Well, I’ve been here all along.
Steve Sanghi: Haven't seen you lately, welcome back.
Ray Rund - Shaker Investments: Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: In answering your question, no. Nothing stops us from buying Atmel stock other than the normal issues, there are limits on how much you can buy based on Antitrust Hart-Scott-Rodino Clearance, at 5% you have to file and there are some other restrictions about that. They have a poison pill, there are various regulatory restrictions along the way. But no, it doesn't stop you.
Ray Rund - Shaker Investments: So, have you actually been making prudent purchases up to the limits of the stock at these lower prices?
Steve Sanghi: We're not prepared to answer that question.
Ray Rund - Shaker Investments: Okay. Thank you very much, Gordon, good to see that you will be continuing and thank you for taking my question.
Steve Sanghi: You are welcome Ray.
Operator: And your next question is from Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS: Thank you very much, can you hear me?
Steve Sanghi: Yes.
Uche Orji - UBS: Thank you. Two questions, first on the Hampshire acquisition. Can you give us an idea what will be the incremental revenue contribution, and you have your own touchscreen controller, Hampshire brings on and then when you -- if and when the deal with Atmel completes, you will also have incremental technology. What do all these technologies bring? Do they bring end market exposure customers or complimentary technologies.
Ganesh Moorthy: Let me see if I can take your question in parts. This is Ganesh. With respect to the revenue contribution from Hampshire, I expect it will less than $1 million dollars in this quarter, so it’s in that size. We certainly see -- we don't have a touch screen controller solution in our portfolio today. We have touch sensing for buttons and sliders, that kind of stuff in our portfolio. So Hampshire gives us an expansion or extension of what we offered today in our [Entouch] portfolio. And with respect to the Atmel product line, it is probably too early to talk about them. We will give you an update on that at a future date. We see that they have touch solutions that are complementary to what we do. But right we are focused on how do we provide our solutions from Entouch for touch sensing and touchscreen control for Microchip.
Uche Orji - UBS: Thanks. And in terms of Steve, in terms of Gordon's new role, it sounds like a much more role that could extend just beyond if and when the Atmel deal goes through. This means we will expect a more active role in terms of consolidation in the marketplace and if that were to be the case, would you still maintain your commitment to paying a dividend?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. Microchip is absolutely committed to paying dividends as I said earlier. We are generating a very, very large cash flow from operations, and short-term, there is some inventory build that is going to happen, despite taking some shut down actions. But longer term, as that inventory goes back down, it even further generates even a high level of cash generation. There is no problem in Microchip's profitability or cash generation, and we are fully committed to not only paying dividends but continuing to grow the dividend on a quarterly basis Gordon's role purely is driven by -- Atmel is a significant acquisition, requiring due diligence, a lot of regulatory action, significant amounts of work, At Microchip, we have no such person fully committed to really doing that kind of work. So, I do it in my spare time, Ganesh does it in his spares time, everybody else does it. And there is a fair amount of work, and the amount of time it has taken just for Atmel to respond, I don't know really what that means. So we are prepared, we are prepared now with Gordon agreeing to really do this full time. It help us expand the management bandwidth to be able to take really all those actions and with his financial background, knowing everybody at Microchip, a long history and knowledge of our product lines and gross margins, cost structures and others, I think Gordon’s skills will be very, very useful. Now, you mentioned something broader about consolidation. I am not ready to be a proxy of the industry of consolidation in earnings. In grand scale, anyway. But Microchip has a number of small acquisitions on its plate, like the Hampshire Company. This one we were able to complete, another one of a similar size, we lost in the last three, four months. But there are two or three others that we have on our plate and one, two of those we may or may not be able to complete in the next three to nine months. But Atmel is a big one and the small ones required some attention also, so Gordon will be spending time on all of those.
Uche Orji - UBS: Thank you very much. One last question, I didn’t see reference. I dialed in a little bit late. I know you said bookings continue to weaken, how much turns are you planning in terms of this quarter’s mid point guidance and if you can reference that in terms of historical chance level for Q4 that will be helpful?
Gordon Parnell:  We never really answered that question. It just never correlates to any history. We have said a lot of times, just look at the book-to-bill ratio at this time in the last quarter, was 1.15 and in the conference call we had got in question, why was the guidance so conservative if the book-to-bill ratio was 1.15. You see that we finished the quarter only up about 1%. And this quarter book-to-bill was 0.93 and we are guiding down 8 to 16. Our history and our experience has been that the book-to-bill ratio or amount of turns needed, are absolutely no correlation to the results. Customers some times place the orders early, by the time they place it late, by the time they place them early then they cancel them or they push them out and it will depend on customers' behavior as the demand develops and has really no correlation to a mid-point of terms needed.
Steve Sanghi:   It also driven by the behavior of our distribution partners. We have 65% of our revenue that we’ve recognized on the sell-through basis and if they have a different philosophy on they are holding an inventory one quarter versus another, it affects the book-to-bill ratio and hypothetically the gross shipment components. So, that is that for the complexity of that one metric.
Gordon Parnell: Because we don't take the gross shipment to distributor as revenue, but its get into the book-to-bill components, so book-to-bill absolutely has no correlation to the actual sales out from the distribution and our revenue recognition. So, sorry can't really answer that very well.
Operator: And our next question is from Chris Danely with JPMorgan.
Chris Danely - JPMorgan: Can you talk about what the effects of the credit crunch are having on your distributors?
Steve Sanghi: The distributors have reasonable inventory today and most of our larger distributors are reasonably funded and there is no problem. Some of those smaller distributors around the world and regional territories could see some pressure, but I think the bigger pressure is really their ability to ship it to their customers, who have less credibility than they do. Microchip has 63,000 customers worldwide and we just don't really know the situation of every single customer out there. And that’s where the issues are, not really directly with Microchip channel so far.
Chris Danely - JPMorgan: Okay and then is my follow-up, it sounds like the ASIC business took a hit this quarter. Do you expect it to continue to lighten the growth of your other businesses and can you just give us a few words of explanation on what’s going on there?
Steve Sanghi: ASIC business did not take a big hit at all. ASIC business did quite well. Your assessment of taking a big hit is driven by inaccurate assumptions about the split of the 8, 16, 32.
Chris Danely - JPMorgan: All right, thanks.
Operator: And your next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Yes, Steve. Thanks for taking the follow-up question. In your response to an earlier question, you talked about your expectation for the March quarter not to be down. And I guess is given the limited visibility and given the fact that a demand down, driven down in terms of a little bit less predictable than an inventory downturn, what gives you that confidence especially if the credit issue resolve itself probably go into a recession? Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: I can't prove anything to you at this point in time. Visibility is limited. I made that comment looking at a lot of the historical parallels, as I have seen various industry events materialize and how our business has behave. Many times, we have had a sharp correction in a single quarter followed by a small increase.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Any color just around geographic comments for the December guidance?
Steve Sanghi: I don't have really the breakdown by geography, but historically, Europe is weaker in December quarter always because the significant holidays at the end of the year. America is also tends to be weaker because of large number of holidays. In Asia, it is usually stronger in the December quarter because their real holidays don't come in till the March quarter, when the Chinese New Year takes place there.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Maybe it actually still be up sequentially?
Steve Sanghi: I do not know. Such a large change in over 8% to 16%, when I don't believe now with all the geographies will come out.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks, again.
Steve Sanghi: You’re welcome.
Operator: And our next question is from Craig Ellis with Citi.
Craig Ellis - Citi: Thanks for taking the question. Steve, the offer for Atmel has been out for about a month and a half now. I am wondering if you can offer some feedback that you might be hearing from either channel partners or customers on that proposed deal. 
Steve Sanghi: The offer for that was made on October 2nd. So it has been out for 21 days, three weeks, not a month and a half yet. I have largely talked to a lot of investors and analysts till that time and we have purposely not tried to talk to customers or distributors in a great length. There are lots of rules and issues related to it. So we issued a Dear Customer letter, which is posted on our website, you may be able to see it there. This essentially is saying that Microchip will have access to a much more expanded portfolio of product installations to meet the needs of our customers and other than that we don't really have any feedback from that channel. My guess would be when I really engage with them and partially I have been waiting for Atmel's response before we engage with any of them. My feeling is that the response would be very, very positive.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: On a separate topic, looking at the capital budget for this year, the company is at $150 million, I think that is flat or up from where we were a quarter ago in terms of what we're looking for given the guidance for the current quarter. Why wouldn't we have seen that come down?
Steve Sanghi: We are making no new capital commitments right now, with the guidance coming down that much. There `is a lot of activity to push out existing orders of various items, which were ordered when there was growth expected. Last quarter was a record quarter. And going into the quarter ago, we were not expecting this quarter to be down. Actually we were expecting some growth. A number of businesses are growing, like 16Bit and Analog and others. So plus there are always mixed issues, handler for a different package, something for some other stuff. So there is a lot of stuff in order. And some time again, you need this guidance to be in the public domains, before you can go aggressively work that with your suppliers and vendors in canceling or pushing out equipment. If you start to do that, ahead of time before announcing this, then it leaks in the market place and causes some problems.
Gordon Parnell: Craig a larger part of our capital this year is in brick and mortar. We know that we are going to need the extension, expansion and time, maybe not as quickly as we originally thought, but it is still an important part for us. We want to go ahead and complete that. So, there is no flexibility related to that component of our capital.
Steve Sanghi: That’s worth $35 million, there the $115 million is really the brick and mortar in Thailand and India.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Thanks.
Operator: And out next question is from Romit Shah with Barclays Capital.
Romit Shah - Barclays Capital: Good afternoon. Steve, regarding the Atmel deal, would you still consider financing the deal with stock?
Steve Sanghi: Will be still consider financing that deal with stock? Well, that offer is in cash. And like I said before, the next step is for Atmel to come and engage with us in meaningful deliberations and give us some due diligence, so we can understand what it is worth inside and then sit down with us and try to carve out -- I can't really answer that question without really knowing anything about it.
Romit Shah - Barclays Capital: I think you said previously that you were open to issuing stock to get the deal done. I think when you announced that the stock was 26 or 27, and I was wondering if you were open to it with the stock down here?
Steve Sanghi: It is a good question Romit. I admit I am not pleased with where the stock is now and offering stock when it is so low. Really it doesn't present a very good proposition but think about this. I can buy the stock from the market and then give it to them. So it is equivalent to paying cash. Think of it as maybe a two-step solution. When I give a $100 million in stock, you can buy $100 million of stock from the market at 21 – 22 and then give them that stock, it is equivalent to giving them $100 million in cash. So there are a lot of things that can be worked, but they have got to be meaningful negotiations with Atmel privately, not really in the public market place like this call.
Romit Shah - Barclays Capital: I think the reason why I bring it up is, about a year ago, you made a big bet on microchip, and announced a fairly large buy back when the stock was 27, 28, now, it is at 21, 22 and I was just wondering if your mind set had changed.
Steve Sanghi: Mindset had changed regarding what? Did you expect a year ago we will have a global crisis? If that is the case I want to see you.
Gordon Parnell: Every stock has taken a substantial hit over the last two months. And these are uncharted waters that we are all going through in relation to what we thought 12 months ago and it's a whole new ball game.
Steve Sanghi: After we bought the stock it went to 42. That's right. It went to 42 as high. And then if you were one person in the world, who knew what was going to happen here, with the S&P down 40%, then we should meet. I want to pick your brain.
Romit Shah - Barclays Capital: All right. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: And your next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Goldman Sachs.
Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs: Yes thank you. Following up on the Atmel deal, you mentioned product line expansion. Can you give us a little color in terms of motivation behind the deal? If I think about three different buckets be it product line expansion being one, consolidation in an industry that needs it and is very fragmented, and then number three, just some economic value to Microchip doing the deal. Can you put any waiting behind some of those different scenarios in terms of the motivation behind the deal?
Steve Sanghi: I really can't put the waiting behind I think all three points are valid and those are some of the rationale for the deal we have describe before. It provides customer a much more complete solution with very strong 8-bit product line and strong 16-bit product line from Microchip and it combined a very strong 32-bit product line, combining our 32-bit portfolio along with theirs and it provides significant value to Atmel shareholders and still leaves the value to be created for our shareholders, as we apply our manufacturing strength and management strength and infrastructure to improve that business. So, I think it’s a good deal for everybody. That’s a rationale.
Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: You’re welcome.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. So, I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Sanghi.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you for all. You know I think you all know that these are completely uncharted waters. Every semiconductor company that has announced the results have been just absolutely, something people didn't expect starting from Linear Technology, whoever the first one. I am really so glad that I was in the first one this time, I have been in few times and that’s not pretty usually, not pretty being later either, but here we are and we show you that we have managed through these times very, very well, better than any of our competitors in the past. And we will show you again this time and we will see many of you on the road as we visit some of the conferences in this quarter. Thank you.
Operator: We thank you for your participation on today’s call. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Microchip Technology First Quarter Fiscal Year 2009 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Please go ahead sir.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. Let me first welcome you to Microchip's earnings conference call for fiscal first quarter 2009. I'll pass this call to our Chief Financial Officer, Gordon Parnell for our financial results. Gordon?
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Steve, and good afternoon everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding the future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 2008 and our 8-K current reports that have been filed with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today as well as Steve is Ganesh Moorthy, our Executive Vice President. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2009 financial results reviewing geographic data and discussing balance sheet and cash information. And Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, outlining our guidance for the September quarter and update other prevalent matters regarding our business. We will then all be available to respond to specific Investor and Analyst questions. Net sales for the June quarter were a record $268.2 million, up approximately 3% from net sales of $260.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter and up approximately 1.6% from net sales of $264.1 million in the prior year's first quarter. We're continuing to include additional information in our press release related to SFAS 123(R). Our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of the adoption of this accounting standard and a favorable adjustment related to tax reserves in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Our earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were a record $0.44 per diluted share in the June quarter, an increase of 4.6% from $0.42 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter and an increase of 12.1% from $0.39 per diluted share in the prior year's first quarter. GAAP earnings per share for the June quarter were $0.40 per diluted share, inclusive of all share-based compensation expenses. The impact on earnings related to share-based compensation in the June quarter was 7.6%. Looking at geographical information, Asia revenues were up sequentially, while both Europe and Americas were down in the June quarter. Asia bounced back very strongly in the June quarter growing 11.5% sequentially. The most significant portion of growth we experienced was from our China region, which grew 18.2% sequentially as we reported in our press release of today. The Americas and Europe regions were impacted by economic factors in both territories resulting in those regions being down sequentially 1.4 % and 5% respectively. Asia continues to be our largest geography, representing approximately 46.3% of total sales. Europe represented approximately 29.1% of sales and Americas approximately 24.6% of sales. I'd remind you this measurement is based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes for our customers, not necessarily representative of where the design activity is taking place, or where the consumption is finally occurring. Taking a look at operating P&L levels, initially I am looking at gross margin and operating expenses prior to the effects of share-based compensation in the initial review here. Our gross margins were 61.6% in the June quarter, establishing new record levels for the company. Our total operating expenses were 26.4% of sales in the June quarter compared with the prior quarter, which was 26.8% of sales. Research and development costs were $29.1 million representing 10.8% of sales. Sales and general administrative expenses were $41.8 million representing 15.6% of sales. The improvement in total operating expenses reflects movement towards our longer-term goals in this area that we have shared with investors. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation were 61%, and total operating expenses were $77 million or 28.7% of sales. The tax rate for the June quarter was 18.1% on both the GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax advantage securities. The dividend that we declared today of $0.338 per share was an increase of approximately 2.4% sequentially, and an increase of 14.6% over the same quarter in fiscal 2008. The dividend payment associated with this declared dividend will be approximately $62.5 million and will be cashed out in the September period. Turning our attention to the balance sheet, our inventories were $125.8 million at the end of June, representing approximately 110 days, which was down two days from the inventory levels as of the end of March. Deferred income on shipments to distributors was $97.1 million, up by $1.7 million from March reported information. At June 30th, distributors were holding about 32 days of inventory using the same calculation as I used for the inventory days that I just mentioned. Based on distribution sell through activities, the inventories in the distribution channel reflect approximately 1.71 of sell through. The combined inventories on our balance sheet and at our distributors represent now 142 days of total inventory, down by three days from the March levels. At June 30, our receivables were $135.8 million decreasing by $2.6 million or 1.9% from balances as of the end of March. Although net sales in the quarter, the June quarter increased sequentially, 3% as I indicated. Net sales in the June quarter were less back-end weighted compared to the March quarter, and that combined with excellent customer payment performance offset the sequential increase in revenues. Our payment performance by our customers continues to be in good shape with minimal balances beyond terms. As of June 30th, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1,553 billion. During the quarter, Microchip generated net cash flow from the business of approximately $118.3 million. Payments related to our cash dividend of $0.33 were $61 million and cash used in our stock buyback was approximately $23.6 million in the quarter. We anticipate building approximately $110 million in operational cash in the September quarter prior to dividends and any stock buyback activity that we may be involved with. Capital spending for the period was approximately $21.7 million in the quarter. Depreciation expense in the quarter was $23.2 million versus $26.4 million for the same quarter last fiscal year and $22.9 million in the March quarter. Our capital expenditure forecast is currently $110 million and depreciation forecast is approximately $95 million, both for the full fiscal year 2009. The capital expenditure forecast includes approximately $30 million relating to the addition of a new building in Thailand in support of our growing assembly and test requirements. Now, I ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Executive Vice President: Great. Thank you Gordon and good afternoon everyone. I will now comment on the individual product lines. Let's start with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business achieved record revenue and was up 3% sequentially and up 2% from the year-ago quarter. Flash microcontroller business meanwhile hit another record and was up 3.5% on a sequential basis and up 11.5% from the year-ago quarter. Flash microcontrollers now represent 75.5% of our microcontroller business. Development tools, which is one of our leading indicators were very strong again achieving another record with almost 35,000 development tools shipped last quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter of record development tools shipments indicative of continued strong design and activity and acceptance of our solutions, and this should bode well for future growth. Moving to our 16-bit microcontrollers, this business completed another good quarter and achieved record revenue as well. Revenue was up 5% sequentially and up 60% from the year-ago quarter. We shipped over 4,200 16-bit development tools in the June quarter bringing the total 16-bit development tools shipped to date to over 48,000. The revenue growth and development tool shipment results reflect a strong design win momentum across the broad range of customers and applications and the number of 16-bit volume customers grew by over 13.5% in the quarter to 1,433 in the June quarter from 1,261 in the March quarter. In terms of 16-bit customers overall volumes, that number continues to remain in the several thousands. Our 32-bit microcontroller line continues to make good progress. We now have 11 products of the 32-bit family that are in production with several more that are sampling. Customer interest has been very high and the industry accolades have continued to come in for this product line. We have a large number of designs across the broad range of both customers and applications that are starting to incubate and while we know that the design cycles will be long, we are optimistic about the 32-bit line's contribution to our overall microcontroller growth and leadership position. Moving to our Analog products, our analog business was up 2.5% sequentially and up 8% from the year-ago quarter, achieving another quarterly record for revenue. The number of customers buying our analog products grew to over 14,000 from 13,400 in the previous quarter and we continue to be encouraged by the level of design and activity and the breadth of customers that this activity is occurring at. Finally, on our serial E-squared business, this business was also up over 2.5% sequentially, and we returned to a pattern of growth after two quarters of sequential declines. The pricing in this marketplace declined moderately quarter-over-quarter. Let me now pass it on to Steve for some general comments as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Steve?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Ganesh and good afternoon everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the June quarter, then I will provide guidance for the September 2008 quarter. I'm very pleased and proud of our execution in the June quarter amidst one of the most challenging business environments that I have seen in a while. Despite this environment, we made new records in the net sales, gross margin and non-GAAP earnings per share. It was also pleasing to see that we achieved growth in all of our product lines with microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers and analog all making new records. We also shipped a record number of development tools providing evidence of continued strong design momentum on our products. With this growth and comparing it to our competitors' reports, it is clear that we are continuing to gain market share after a perceived pause in the market share gains last year due to our exposure in the U.S. housing market. During the quarter, we also saw some investors' concerns emerge about the possible negative effect of earthquake in China. This concern was very hard to understand because we were having record quarter in China. At the end, we completed the quarter with record sales in China and were up a whopping 18.2% sequentially. Against the backdrop of these results, we are disappointed by the level of carnage done to Microchip's stock price by reports of a slowdown in China. Now I will discuss the guidance for the September quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio for June quarter was 1.15. We achieved all-time record bookings in the June quarter. Our starting backlog for September quarter was significantly higher than our starting backlog for June quarter. We are also on a path to complete the month of July as the best first month of the quarter ever and better than the month of April last quarter. We have seen lead-times for many of our products push out for two to four weeks and that was partially responsible for some of the strong bookings last quarter and continuing into the current quarter. Bookings are great because it builds backlog and operational visibility, but we only recognize revenue when we ship the product to our direct customers or through distributors sell through. In revenue recognition, we're not seeing the kind of strength that we are seeing in bookings. We're also mindful of continuing challenges in the U.S. economy, effects of strong euro as well as summer holidays in Europe and the effects of high energy prices globally. There is also possibility of some disruption with Chinese government shutting down factories within 200 miles of Beijing to clean up the air for Olympics, although many customers are moving production to other factories outside this 200 mile radius. So taking all that into consideration and after a very comprehensive review processes, we expect that our net sales for September quarter to be up 0 to plus 3% sequentially. We expect to achieve another record gross margin between 61.6% to 61.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $0.44 to $0.45 and our GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $0.40 to $0.41. With that, Irene, would you please poll for questions? Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. First we'll go to Chris Danely with JPMorgan Equity Research.
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan: Thanks Steve. It looks like I was a little off on my China prediction there. Can you just talk about what you saw as the area of strength there and then talk about other goes out in the world?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, thanks Chris. China was the strongest geography overall in the world. And overall, Asia did quite well too outside of China. China was up 18.2% and overall Asia was up about 11.5% or so that Gordon mentioned. Lot of the business we do in China are really exports back to mostly U.S., but some to Europe also. We will never know the exact number because of lot of the products really moves around. But a significant portion of the business that is done in China is really by multinationals doing manufacturing there. So, at the end, the strength of overall business in China comes down to back to our strong demand creation efforts here in U.S., through our own efforts from the last two or three years and continuing efforts of demand creation in China and Asia, where we also added a lot of resources to further take control of the demand creation. And I think, we've been talking about it for a while and you kind of seeing the results now show through in the demand creation efforts, resulting into revenue. We are doing business with record number of customers. At the last count, I think we had mentioned 60,000 customers, we didn't quite count them prior to this earnings call, I believe the number has grown further. We're doing business with lots of additional customers. However, because of the economy, every customer is buying less product than they are buying otherwise. So, run rates are smaller, but we're doing business with record number of customers. So, when you do the overall math, record number of customers even buying slightly less products overall is resulting into sequential growth, less sequential growth than we would like otherwise, nevertheless business is still growing. We grew in March quarter 3%; we grew in June quarter 3%; we're guiding September quarter up 0% to 3%. So, you can see that we're heading for significant growth over the four quarters here compared to where some of the Dataquest and numbers SAE numbers are. And I was just handed a note, our total customer base worldwide is now over 63,000.
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan: Great thanks.
Operator: We'll now go to JoAnne Feene with FTN Midwest Research
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest Research: Yes, thanks for taking my call. I had a question about some of the new products. The 16-bit and the 32-bit and also your efforts in analog. Last quarter you had thought that you might end up doing sequential growth in 16-bit in the range of I think you said 12% to 15% and in analog, something in the order of 8% to 12%. And if you even consider it a bit wider than that this quarter. Can you help us understand what the hold [ph] up is there?
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: The growth doesn't always come linearly quarter-by-quarter. You've seen prior quarters, where we've had 16-bit growth 30% and 40% sequentially. So, we take our best shot at the beginning of the quarter, but customers can place, it can be a month off one way or another. But if you look at it on an annualized basis, I think that's the much better way to look at the growth.
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest Research: Okay. So you're still feeling like that's the kind of number we should think about quarter-to-quarter to generating annual forecasts for both of those areas it sounds like?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think the... some of the comments that I made in general about record number of customers, but everybody, they are buying less quantity than they will buy otherwise, it holds good for analog and 16-bit also because they go into similar market exposures where we have others. We usually do not break out sales by product line at the start of the quarter. We report them at the end of the quarter. Once in a while we've taken the liberty to kind of point out what was driving the growth, and we mentioned the numbers in analog and 16-bit. In hindsight, looking back at it, probably was an error. So, we're not repeating that this quarter. The analog customer base became a new record as Ganesh mentioned earlier, the 16-bit microcontroller was a new record. However the number of units everybody bought was lower than really what we had anticipated. So, we still sequentially grew 3% sort of middle of the guidance range. But, our internal expectations were a lot higher.
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest Research: And if I could follow-up, you talked last quarter about how you probably saw the bottom in December. And then, you guys sort of led the industry and you were seeing a turn? Do you still feel that way about the market, you're expressing some caution here? Are you seeing anything in terms of order trends, it sounds very positive that gives you still that confidence even though you're being a bit cautious?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well I think... I think there is a brand new economic phenomenon taking over the world which is the high energy prices, a very strong euro, extreme economic weakness in U.S. whether it's headed for recession or not. Our comments back in December time frame were really coming out of the inventory correction or whatever more back that happened, the first wave of housing issues back in September and November time frame. We did recover from that, and then we talked about our internal demand creation effort worked quite strong and was keeping us ahead of really the general market environment in the industry. We did perform to that. We were up 3% in March, up 3% in June guiding up for September. So, in general, I think we feel pretty good about it, but at the same time we have to give you caution about the global market environment. If you look at all the earnings reports we have been tracking for the last week to two weeks, TI on down, the guidances that are coming in almost minus 3 to plus 3, centering around zero. So, that reflects the overall what is being seen in the global economy. We feel we're doing slightly better than that because of some of the efforts we have put in.
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest Research: Okay. Thanks very much.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Welcome.
Operator: We will now go to Doug Freedman with American Technology Research.
Doug Freedman - American Technology Research: Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about the fact that you're seeing your lead times expand and the fact that distribution seems to be willing to place orders on you. Steve, you've mentioned the TI call, where we saw distribution sort of signaling that they really didn't want to carry some inventory here at this time. Can you just comment on that versus what you're seeing?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we're seeing very strong orders from distribution and we are seeing distributors willing to give us visibility as well as willing to place inventory. Our distribution inventory isn't growing. Last quarter, distribution inventory was 1.7 months, down from 1.8 months a quarter before. So that result isn't any different. However, Microchip takes revenue recognition at sell through. Texas Instruments takes revenue recognition at selling. So, they get directly impacted by what distribution takes in. We do not get impacted by that, we only get impacted by what sells out and the sales out were pretty good even though the distribution inventory declined. However, the strong orders reflect that we're building backlog, we're getting good operational visibility, and part of that is because of strong demand. And we've had some specific package issues also, two or three packages demand, just tripled and quadrupled on our sales where certain volume customers decided to take one package versus the other. So, couple of lead times went out, and that kind of created the effect of people wanting to secure more product. And pretty soon it kind of spread across the board. So, the bookings were very, very strong and we have good visibility from distributors going all the way into September. Having said that, it's not like distributors are stocking inventory and building inventory, even if they were, that wouldn't affect our revenue.
Doug Freedman - American Technology Research: Correct understood. Can you talk whether you are seeing any impact you mentioned the packaging, are you seeing any impact from commodity prices and flowing through or people [ph] or your suppliers starting to try to raise prices or any of that impacting, or do you see or are you concerned about that?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, yes, gold prices are up 2x and aluminum and copper and some of others are similar, the natural gas prices, transportation costs and really all those have gone up. So, nobody can escape those. We are doing record yields in our factories, record outputs in our factories. So to some extent, countering some of those effects, we are pleading with our customers and many of them we are not giving any price reductions. We maybe have done some selected price increases to pass through some of the cost of the commodity prices, and we still produce to record gross margin, and not a whole lot higher than the prior quarter, but nevertheless a record. And we are in that asymptotically approaching that 62% non-GAAP gross margin that we have been guiding you towards and it's 61.6% right now. So, it's really within 40 basis points of that, and will take a few quarters to get there, because there is a lot of headwind in terms of commodity pricing.
Doug Freedman - American Technology Research: And my last question for you. On the capital spending line, you're showing that you're going to spend, I believe, it's $110 million this year. Can you give as an idea of where that's targeted at? And that will be my last one. Thanks so much.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: The capital is pretty spread out, largest amount of capital out of that is assembly and test where we have to really add capital one-to-one when we're growing there to add capital. The fab portion is a lot smaller because as we have mentioned to you before, we have $1.6 billion revenue worth of installed capacity in the fab, and we only have to add small incremental amount of capital to get there, because we have purchase aggression fab where they are heavily loaded with equipment. So, the largest portion out of the $110 million is assembly and test. Also included in that $110 million is the $30 million of brick and mortar building which depreciates over 25 to 30 years. So, don't look at the $110 million of capital as and $95 million depreciation as if the depreciation would grow. Take that $30 million out and then the capital only becomes about $80 million, which would really depreciate over shorter time and current depreciation is $95 million. So, the net depreciation in the company is still dropping, the $30 million building is a one-time cost which will depreciate over many, many years.
Doug Freedman - American Technology Research: Terrific. Thanks for the detail.
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: No. I think that covers it very fully.
Doug Freedman - American Technology Research: Okay.
Operator: We'll now go to Jeff Rosenberg with William Blair & Company.
Jeff Rosenberg - William Blair & Company: Hi. Could you give us an update, I think you've talked about in recent months some noise in your bookings as it relates to the Arrow transition. Can you talk a little bit about how that's played out?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think, as you see by the results, it has played out quite well. There were speculations by some on the Street that this would be a huge negative and we never understood how it could be huge negative. For two years or so, people were saying, "Well Arrow wasn't doing anything.” So it was a negative for Microchip and we've terminated them, and then there was the report again that would be negative because we terminated them. You can't have both sides. They were not doing anything; so terminating them would only be positive which is really the case. They were really not doing anything, the Arrow transition has been completed, all of the Arrow business have been successfully transitioned to other distributors around the world to Future Electronics, to Avnet, to Silica in Europe, which is a branch of Avnet and to some of our other regional and local distributors and catalog distributors around the world. So that transition at this point in time is complete and I will think it's an extremely good transition. The resulting distributors now are extremely charged up, doing demand creation, adding dedicated resources. As we speak, we're undergoing our annual masters' conference in Arizona, which is our annual strategic, technical exchange in the view with our customers. It's a record attendance over 1,000 people in attendance. People are paying huge amount of money to come here with 110 degree heat out in Arizona which clearly shows that people are interested in our products coming to learn it, paying money to truly come here and there are large number of distributor field application engineers here also as we they are engaging, or want to learn and want to go out and sell our product. So, the entire distribution momentum has really turned very positive.
Jeff Rosenberg - William Blair & Company: Okay. Thanks. And then the other question I want to ask you was just looking at the strength you're seeing at 16-bit maybe wonder in general about whether you are seeing stronger demand? If there is any difference in the demand trends you're seeing, high-end mid-range, low-pin count products, I mean it's the 18 series, 16-bit, any... seeing in different trends. Now, what you're seeing in your baseline products versus your real low-pin count products, I don't know if there is anything to be gained there from a different trends you might be seeing across your product line?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Let me pass it to Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy - Executive Vice President: There's really nothing specific about 16-bit necessarily. I think 16-bit is growing faster obviously from a smaller base. But, we are seeing strength across all of the different architectures.
Jeff Rosenberg - William Blair & Company: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll now hear from Craig Hettenbach with Goldman Sachs.
Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs: Yes. Thank you. Gordon, on the operating margin front, going forward, is there anything in terms of efficiencies to be gained there, or do you think that operating margins grow more with the revenue growth going forward?
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Well, we have directed 62% overall gross margins from, on a non-GAAP basis. So, and as Steve said, that will take several quarters to realize as we look at our operating expenses line, we expect to continue to make some efficiency improvements overtime. But again, we want to make sure that we offer the appropriate investment from an R&D and a sales infrastructure and chemical support for our customers as we go forward. So, again we expect to see some modest improvements over time getting to our corporate goals in that area.
Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And if I could follow-up. Steve, any new updates for us on the acquisition or M&A environment out there?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I would say the M&A environment continues to be difficult. Stock prices are down quite substantially just from six months ago, or a year ago. Ordinarily, that would really mean there should be opportunities, but no management teams like their stock prices, they all think the stock prices are unduly knocked down by the Street and everybody is waiting for their stock prices to get to old highs and they want premiums above that. Very few deals are getting done. I think, I just watched the roster and not hearing a lot of announcements. So, we continued to be interested in the proposition. We have the cash to do it, we have the currency to do it, we have some desire to do it, but we are very selective. We don't want to... our growth has largely been organic, but if a right kind of acquisition where to come along, we will be quite interested in it. But we're more interested to not do a bad deal than to do a good deal. So, we'll pass on to bad... good deal to avoid a bad deal and good deals are not easy to come by.
Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs: Okay. So it sounds like more tuck-in type deals, if deals happen in the near to intermediate term?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, there is nothing near to intermediate term. There is nothing... we're not anything close to that... close to that you can call it near-term.
Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We will now go to Romit Shah of Lehman Brothers.
Romit Shah - Lehman Brothers: Yes. Thanks a lot. Steve I'm still just trying to get my answer on the revenues coming in towards the lower end of your guidance and the backlog being so strong. Can you just spend a little time telling that linearity in the quarter and does that explain part of the disconnect?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think the quarter was quite linear, and in fact the quarter we just finished is one of the most linear quarters we have. The March quarter is non-linear because the Chinese New Year, the September quarter is non-linear because of August shutdown in Europe and December quarter is non-linear because of all the holidays at the end, the June quarter is probably the most linear quarters we go through, was it any different Gordon?
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Yes. I think it was really in the order that you indicated. I think one of the key element, it's, Romit is the extension of lead times and specific areas that we have spoken to and that customers have given us an improved visibility in terms of backlog in those areas because of an extension of two to four weeks in particular areas of our business. So that's certainly one element that's important to take into consideration as you look at our results.
Romit Shah - Lehman Brothers: Is it fair to say that the six-month backlog has grown at a faster rate than the three-months backlog then?
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: I really wouldn't know what those statistics are.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think three months backlog is up quite a bit also. I don't know if the six months has grown faster than three months. Nobody has asked the question that way so, we haven't looked at it.
Romit Shah - Lehman Brothers: Okay.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: As I mentioned the three months backlog, starting backlog on July 1 was substantially stronger than starting backlog on April 1. However I've been broken record on it for many, many years. Book-to-bill never correlates with our end-results and starting backlog never correlates with our end results. And Street is obsessed with it, maybe it makes sense for other people's business or in the commodity business, where you're competing with others to get the orders for the current quarter in DRAM or Flash or analog. In our business, it's a designing business, and once we have won the design, the business is ours. It doesn't matter whether you get the order on July 1 or you got the order on June 30. So, therefore don't read way too much into it. I simply look at it as an operational visibility, we can be more efficient in starting the wafers, manufacturing the product, planning the capacity with more certainty. But if you get larger orders before it simply means the turns are going to lower because the customers gave you their orders.
Romit Shah - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then just lastly on the strength in July, have you guys seen North America and Europe start to come back or is the strength building driven mainly by China?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: The strength is driven by Asia, yes, China in particular and Asia in general. The North America business is really quite strong, because again I would emphasize that a good portion of what we do in China is really North American customers simply manufacturing there. So while the U.S. economy is totally sick, our U.S. business is very healthy and if you were to magically measure it by where the business is consumed, rather than where it's manufactured, then you will see that our U.S. business grew very handsomely. We created a tremendous demand in U.S. despite a very, very soft economy.
Romit Shah - Lehman Brothers: All right, thanks a lot, good luck.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: From UBS we'll go to Uche Orji.
Uche Orji - UBS: Thank you very much. Steve just a quick follow-up on the distribution ... distributor relationships. How would you now rate the agreement with Avnet's Memic in terms of incremental demand creation? Has that been tracking in line with what you expected? And then also, can you just update me on your headcounts in terms of how you also drive in the manipulation internally and specifically headcounts in China versus the developed market? So two questions there.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, our distribution relationships are the best they have been in a very long time. They are better than what they were pre-conflict with Arrow, because in the new distributor relationships, we are getting very, very strong and really dedicated resources from Avnet in future. In Avnet, we are not in the larger Avnet, which is Avnet Electronic Marketing. We're in the Memic branch of Atmel... Memic branch of Avnet, where none of our larger competitors are there. TI, Atmel, Cypress, Renaissance, NEC, PHILIPS, Infineon or anybody else, they are all in the Avnet EM, the general purpose Avnet division. We are in the Memic division, which really has Microchip as the only main microcontroller line. I think they have couple of small ones like Luminary Micro. So we're getting lot of dedicated attention of large numbers of apps engineers. We have created a similar structure inside and then large number of regional distributors that we have. In fact, the Chairman and CEO of Avnet, Mr. Roy Vallee is the keynote speaker tonight in front of 1,000 of our customer engineers present at our Masters Conference I talked about earlier in Scottsdale tonight. So, this relationship has been all-time wonderful. However, there is a time to market, so it will take another year or so before you see significant acceleration from the results of the enhanced distributor relationships. The results you are seeing meanwhile in the last two, three quarters are the results of our own efforts where we added a large number of internal Microchip resources to create demand and grow our business. That's what you're seeing here today.
Uche Orji - UBS: Right. And then most of that resource got, in terms of the split in resource addition, U.S. versus emerging markets, [inaudible] most of that is in emerging markets.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We're not going to give you that because that's a good consumption for our competitors.
Uche Orji - UBS: Okay. Fair enough. Just one another question. In terms of how you describe the U.S., in terms of your are creating good demands in the U.S. even though the macro environment is a bit soft. Are you seeing... what particular areas are you seeing these demand creation in terms of end products and can you also comment on things like touch pads because that is like a growth areas for MCU since your relationship with Quantum that [inaudible]. Is that... what are you doing in terms of driving demand within that period?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Microchip has its own touch sense technology we introduced about a year ago. We have very, very large number of design wins. You'll see probably a year from now that Microchip probably makes the largest amount of shipments on touch-based technology compared to anybody including Cypress. We just can't really all share that with you or name any customers, or name any design wins. Your first part of your question was what areas are we seeing this growth. Let me tell you, we are not seeing it in housing and we are seeing it everywhere else.
Uche Orji - UBS: Okay.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We don't want to narrow down any more. So, the housing segment, I haven't given you housing index in a while because I told you before that I was only going to do it for about six months or so. After that, there are new designs and customers moving to Asia and people manufacturing here and there and so many moving parts and it becomes very, very hard to correlate. But we continued to look at it internally, continue to try to track it internally. The housing index was slightly up March to June. Why I don't ask, why it was up? I think it was up because few new designs went to production over there, but the housing index was up slightly, but nothing to write home about. So, our business is growing really outside of housing. I'm actually quite proud of Microchip people that very quickly shifted some of the resources to other areas of the business, took some low-hanging fruit and very, very quickly able to negate the impact of the housing by growing our business in all other channels worldwide.
Uche Orji - UBS: Right. And what about automotive?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Automotive business, you read the story, you read the news. The U.S. automotive business is pretty sick. We are doing better elsewhere in Europe and Asia, but the overall automotive business is not growing.
Uche Orji - UBS: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll now going to Craig Ellis with Citi.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Thank you very much. Steve, I think early in the call you mentioned that there were some packaging issues that contributed to some lead time elongation. Can you identify if those packaging issues have been resolved, and if not, when would you expect that to happen?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: The packaging issues have been resolved. In fact, some of the additional capital we have added is in those areas to try to tool up those packages internally. Remember, we do about 70% of the assembly ourself and about 30% of the assembly is outsourced. We do nearly 100% of the test ourselves. So, we've added some additional capital to improve both the test capacity for those packages as well as bring some more internal capacity for those packages that are underlined just outside. So, as we speak, we've made very, very significant progress. All the lead time have not come down yet, but we believe that going out of this quarter, we shouldn't have any impact because of packaging.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: And would you expect lead times to have... I don't know how much they've moved up, but would you expect them to come back in a little bit as you make headway on getting shipments up, given the back-end investments that you have made?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Probably not completely, because the next quarter is front-end-loaded quarter because of the holidays. So, people have to place their orders for October and November, and we're likely to do see strong backlog, so... that continues to really put pressure on the lead time. So, I don't think they will fully recover.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Okay. And then maybe just a longer-term question for Ganesh. On the 16-bit business, it's my understanding that while you got 150 or so products out there due to the time it takes to get a design in, maybe half of them or less are actually generating revenues. So, if that so then what kind of visibility does that give you into the... the growth of that business over the next four quarters or so, given the revenue faction you're seeing from those products that already are generating revenue?
Ganesh Moorthy - Executive Vice President: Of the 150, I would say, about a third of them are really in revenue-generation, the other two-thirds are all in design-in phase from the time they were introduced. I think we get a fair amount of customer design-in visibility, we are obviously involved at many of those designs, we're helping those customers overcome the issues in the way they are getting to production. And so this over... as we go quarter-by-quarter, you'll see more and more of these products being introduced over the last one to two years. Getting to the point, where their applications are tested, validated and go into production. And so we expect 16-bit to benefit from that and we will continue to see a sustained growth rate that is above what our corporate average is for some time to come.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Okay. And then quickly on the 32-bit business, I know that development tools are seen as good proxy for growth prospects. When will development tool shipments be sufficient to start to give you an idea of what the uptake for the 32-bit product line will be?
Ganesh Moorthy - Executive Vice President: It's going to be a little more complex, because many of the development tools on 32-bit are also shared with 16-bit. And so I don't know if there is an accurate indicator from just development tools alone. However, what we do track is, customer engagements and how many of them, how far along they are, when they are going to... when they are planning to go into production et cetera. And by looking at those indicators, we believe that 32-bit is very much on track without expectation that it will have a design-in cycle that is at or slightly above where the 16-bit design-in cycle have been. And 16-bit has been about an 18 to 24 month design-in cycle.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Ganesh.
Operator: We will now go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Yes. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions, just a couple of follow-ups, Steve, on the geographic breakdown just when you look at the Europe revenue being down sequentially, how much of that do you attribute to sort of macro weakness versus the fact that March kind of represent a difficult to compare?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Europe has a strange revenue profile. We internally call it the Euro curve. Large portion of our European business is really through lots and lots of regional distributors. Largest distributor in Germany, and largest distributor in France, the largest distributor in Italy, in Spain. They are all regional distributors. They are not the global distributors. So through the regional distributors it's very much dependent on what the local number of working days and holidays and all that pattern is. Europe has the largest number of working days in the month... in the March quarter. In the June quarter, they have... the late part of the June there are some holidays, there also... Easter comes in April. August is close because of summer. Then they have holidays in December quarter. So, we usually every year see a majority of our growth from Europe in the first quarter. This time in the March quarter, we were up about 17% some number like that.
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I think it was in that region.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: In that region of 16% to 17%.
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: In double digit.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And then June quarter will be up, often flat-to-down slightly. We were down a little more than we would like to be in the June quarter and that was because of the economy and strong euro. The September quarter in Europe is always down because of holidays in August. We're modeling down little more than what we ordinarily would do because again... because of strong euro. And December quarter is again always flat-to-down because of slightly less number of working days and then the following March again is really always a very, very big quarter in Europe. So that's sort of our profile. We are slightly off that profile, the drop was deeper than we would like and we're modeling the September drop to be deeper than we would like.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: And then see, this is the first time you've given out China's sequential growth. I understand you have been giving it out... you gave it out because there is something concerned in the marketplace. I'm just wondering related to that number, is that kind of how China is being growing in the last several quarters. Was this an acceleration or help me understand kind of to put that number in a little bit of perspective?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we broke it out this time because there was a China specific call, which did some major damage to the stock. So, we thought we needed to answer that that China was not an issue. We don't plan to break it out in future, unless there was... in future it could be a specific issue in Italy then maybe we will break out. If we break it out the numbers in 100 different ways we just get... then you just latch on to every single number and it's impossible to go through that.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Well, I guess the reason why I am asking to your point, just given some concerns that... the strength might be because of some disruptions around the Olympic. I'm just kind of trying to get a sense of, how we get comfortable with the fact that this wasn't anomaly ahead of the Olympics and you could see demand slow there?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It was not an anomaly ahead of the Olympics now. June quarter is traditionally a very strong quarter in China and you also you have an easier comparison because of the Chinese New Year in the March quarter. So driven by that because March quarter has one less amount of week, so that itself is responsible for about 7%. So if you take out 18% growth and take out about 7%, then you get to about 10%, 11% growth and China has been growing very, very strong and our expectation in the September quarter is also a majority of the growth comes from China.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Great, that's helpful. Thanks guys.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will go now to Mark Lipacis with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley: Hi, thanks for taking my question. How... going forward, how should we think about the dividend growth. You've been pretty consistent with growing it. Should we think if you guys targeting some kind of a pad as a percentage of free cash flow or should we think about this growing with the cash flow? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We have never targeted a payout ratio. The problem we have with payout ratio is, you could have a very strong quarter and then you pay a lot and then you have a weaker quarter, let's say the cash flow declines in the given quarter because of back-end loaded or less receivables or whatever and then you lower the dividend and the market doesn't respond very well to these kind of gyration. So, our feeling is that we're probably the only company that grows the dividend every quarter, that's what we're committed to do. Overtime as the numbers become substantial, the increase becomes smaller, as we have started doing in this current quarter. We grew it by $0.808 versus increasing it by about $0.01 before, but we want to grow the dividend every quarter. So no matter when an investor buys the stock either before the dividend or after the dividend, they can still continue to see dividend increases. If you increase the dividend once a year like many companies do then there is a lot of speculation around prior to the dividend announcement and people sell it before. So stock goods have some volatility just driven by the dividends. So, our commitment is to increase the dividend every quarter, overtime the increases become smaller, but we are not targeting any kind of payout ratio.
Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Very helpful, thank you.
Operator: And we will take a follow-up question from Chris Danely.
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan: Thanks for it. Just a few follow-up questions. So in terms of the lead times extending, is that on a certain product line or is that across-the-board and then also it sounds like you... you are saying with that those lead times probably come in the December quarter?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well certain specific packages lead time went out little more than normal, but the lead time that can have little bit to even on the all other products also because a lot of the equipment is common, lot of the test equipment, packaging equipment is common. So with a 1.15 book-to-bill ratio with a tremendous backlog when you get all the backlog, you get booked up. So, when the new orders come in they have to be scheduled out. So, our sense is that these lead terms will probably be stable from here and stay in this range for quite some time.
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan: Okay and then in your prepared remarks you talked about high bookings but due to some revenue recognition that wasn't translating into sales. Am I misinterpreting that or could you just expand upon that a little bit?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: What I said is that bookings are great because it build backlog and operational visibility, by operational visibility really what I mean is if I know what to build then I can build it with much more accuracy and I can batch process it rather than breaking FedEx all the time. When you don't have backlog, you don't have operational visibility, then you're building it to a forecast, you are building it to a guess what the customers will come and buy and then you have more tendency to be out of mix on a short-term basis. Therefore you are less efficient in trying to meet their demands. So, operational visibility is naive. But strong bookings and strong backlog does not result into a very, very strong revenue because we only recognize revenue when the distributor ships the product out. And another investor was asking question relative to TI. TI said that the distributors were lowering inventory. We do not get impacted by distributors lowering inventory or increasing inventory because we only recognize revenue to what the distributor sell out. And what I said was that we're not seeing the strength in sell out from distributors which is our revenue recognition consistent with that 1.15 book-to-bill ratio which somebody would like to translate into 15% growth. And we're not seeing that kind of strength in sellout. Hence we have modeled that into the guidance that we have provided.
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan: Thanks. That's helpful. And last question, with the stock selling off here a little bit, why wouldn't you guys crank up the buyback?
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We never said we will not, or we are, or we will or we will not. We have been in a quite period, we don't buy stock when we have inside information. So, we basically did not execute any stock buyback after we entered the quiet period. The window for us opens on Monday and what we will or will not do, you will probably see that in the 10-Q.
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And it appears that's all the time we have for questions. Mr. Sanghi, I'll turn the conference back to you.
Steve Sanghi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you very much everybody. And we'll talk to some of you on the road as we go to some conferences and otherwise talk to you next time in the next earnings call. Thanks everybody.
Operator: Again, that does conclude our conference. We do thank you for joining us.

===== 2008 Q4  (2008-04-29 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Gordon W. Parnell - VP, CFO Ganesh Moorthy - EVP Steve Sanghi - President, CEO and Chairman
Analysts: Harsh Kumar - Morgan Keegan Romit Shah - Lehman Brothers Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan Uche Orji - UBS Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners Jeffery Rosenberg - William Blair Craig Ellis - Citigroup JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest
Operator: Please standby, we are about to begin. Good day everyone and welcome to the Microchip Technology Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2008 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Gordon Parnell. Please go ahead, Sir.
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Keith, and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 conference call. And during the course of the call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, and our 8-K current reports that we have filed with the SEC that identify importance risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President. I will comment on our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 results, reviewing geographic data and discussing balance sheet and cash information, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, outlining our guidance for the June quarter and update other pertinent matters regarding our business. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Let's begin with net sales for the March quarter, which were $260.4 million, up approximately 3.1% from net sales of $252.6 million in the immediately preceding quarter and up approximately 0.9% from net sales of $258.2 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Net sales for the fiscal year 2008 were $1.36 billion, essentially flat year-over-year. In earnings per share we are continuing to exclude additional... to include additional information in our press release related to SFAS 123(R). Non-GAAP results, exclude the adoption of this accounting standard and the favorable adjustment related to tax reserves. The earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were a record $0.42 per diluted share in the March quarter, compared to $0.39 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter and $0.37 per diluted shares in the prior year's fourth quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the March quarter was $79.2 million, which was impacted by interest expense associated with the convertible transaction that the company entered into in December 2007. Net income in the March quarter included the full effects of the transaction with net income being reduced by $3.9 million compared to period prior to the transaction. GAAP net income for the March quarter was $76.7 million or $0.40 per diluted shares, inclusive of all share-based compensation expenses and the adjustment related to tax reserves. The impact on the earnings related to the adoption of share-based compensation in the March quarter was 8.9%, and the earnings per share was favorably impacted by $0.02 related to the adjustment on our tax reserves. Our fiscal 2008 non-GAAP earnings per share were up 6.1% to a $1.57 compared to a $1.48 for fiscal 2007. Our GAAP earnings per share were a $1.40 for fiscal 2008 and included share-based compensation which is approximately $0.13 impact; the sale of Fab 3, about $0.08 impact; and the benefit from various tax matters, which were favorable by about $0.05 combined. Geographic... and sales for both the Americas and Europe were up sequentially, while Asia revenues were down in the March quarter, really all in line with our expectations in entering the quarter. Our results regionally reflect the seasonal impacts in our business in these particular territories. Europe grew 15.6% sequentially and the Americas also grew sequentially by 1.6%. Asia revenues were impacted by the Lunar New Year in many of the territories in the March quarter being down 3.8%. Asia continues to be our largest geography, representing approximately 43% of total sales. Europe represented approximately 31% of sales, and Americas approximately 26% of sales. Again this measurement is based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes for our customers, but doesn't necessarily represents where the design activity is taking place, or where the consumption is occurring. Taking a look at operating P&L information, initially I am using gross margin and operating expenses prior to the effects of share-based compensation. Gross margins were at record levels of 61.5% in the March quarter, and operating expenses were 26.8% of sales, compared with the prior quarter, which were at 26.5% of sales. R&D costs were $28.6 million representing 11% of sales. Sales and general administrative expenses were $41.1 million, representing 15.8% of sales. Operating expenses in the quarter were impacted by the continuing weakness of the dollar on expenses in our international locations, as well as higher bonus allocations as a result... of the results... as a result of what we saw in the March quarter P&L. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins including share-based compensation were 60.9%. Research and development expenses and SG&A expenses combined were $76.9 million or 29.5% of sales. The tax rate for the March quarter was 18.8% on a non-GAAP basis and 13.7% on a GAAP basis which included the favorable adjustment that I mentioned related to our tax reserves. A tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax advantage securities. The dividend that we declared today of $0.33 per share was an increase of approximately 3.1% sequentially, and an increase of 17.9% over the same quarter in fiscal 2007. The dividend payment related to the dividend declared that will be made in the June quarter will equate to approximately $60.9 million. Coming now to the balance sheet, inventories were essentially flat in dollars at a $124.5 million, representing approximately 112 days. This is down two days from inventory levels at the end of December 31st. And deferred income and shipments to distributors was $95.4 million, which was up $2.1 million from the December reported information. At March 31st, distributors were holding about 1.8 months of inventory based on sell-through, down from 1.9 months as of the end of December. And when we combine inventories on our balance sheet and at the distributors, we represent a 145 days of total inventory and this is down four days from December levels. Microchip's receivables at March 31st were a $138.9 million, an increase of $23.9 million or 20.9% from balances as of the end of December. The increase in the balance reflects not only the sequential growth in revenues, but also the back-end leading of revenues in Asia due to Lunar New Year, as well as the transitionary changes in our global distribution network. Payment performance by our customers continues to be excellent with minimum balances beyond terms. In our cash position at March 31st, our cash and total investment position was approximately $1,519 million. During the quarter, Microchip generated net cash flow from the business of approximately $99 million. Payments related to our cash dividend of $0.32 were $60.4 million, and the cash used in our stock buy-back was approximately $173.3 million, representing about 5.5 million shares. Operating cash flow for fiscal 2008 was approximately $476 million and dividend payments for the full fiscal year were $252 million. During the year, we also brought back stock for $1.14 billion, offsetting the net cash received from the convertible transaction of over $1.13 billion. And again that transaction was completed in December '07. We anticipate continuing to build cash operationally in the June quarter, adding about a $120 million in operational cash, prior to dividends and our stock buy-back activities. Capital spending for the March quarter was approximately $20.7 million, and depreciation for March was about $22.9 million. This is versus $27.9 million for the same quarter depreciation wise, and $23.4 million in December of last year. Capital spending for fiscal '08 was $70 million and depreciation for the fiscal year was $98 million. Our capital expenditure forecast is currently $100 million and depreciation forecast is approximately $95 million, both for fiscal '09. Our capital expenditures include approximately $30 million related to the addition of a new building in Thailand in support of our growing assembly and test requirements. I'll now ask Ganesh and Steve to discuss the performance of our business, guidance for the June quarter, and update other business matters. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Executive Vice President: Thank you, Gordon, and good afternoon everyone. I will now comment on the individual product lines, and starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was up 4% sequentially. Our Flash microcontroller business meanwhile hit another record and was up 7% on a sequential basis, and up 11% on a year ago quarter basis. Flash microcontrollers now represent 75% of our microcontroller business. Development tool shipments which are one of our leading indicators were very strong with a record 33,472 development tools shipped last quarter. In fiscal year '08, we shipped a record of 116,832 development tools, 39% more than what we shipped in fiscal year '07, and over the 100,000 per year mark for the first time ever. These strong development tools shipments are indicative of the continued strong activity and acceptance of our solutions and should bode well for future growth. Moving to 16-bit microcontrollers, we had another strong quarter with revenue up 12% sequentially and up 90% over the year-ago quarter. We shipped 3,433 16-bit development tools in the March quarter, bringing the total 16-bit development tool shipped to-date to just over 44,000. In fiscal year '08 we shipped a record 20,575 16-bit development tools, almost twice as many as we shipped in fiscal year '07. The revenue growth and development tool shipment results reflect our strong designing momentum across a broad range of customers and applications. New product introductions continued at a torrid pace as we brought 51 new 16-bit products to market in the March quarter, bringing the total number of 16-bit products now in production to 152. Number of 16-bit customers grew by 13...16-bit volume customers grew by 13%, to 1,261 in the March quarter up from 1,117 in the December quarter and the number of customers of all sizes remained in the several thousands. Our 32-bit microcontroller product line continues to make good progress. 4 more new products began sampling in the March quarter [ph], bringing the total number of product sampling to 11. Customer interest remains very high and the industry accolades for this product line continue to come in. And while we expect the designing cycles for the 32-bit product line to be long, we are very optimistic about its contribution to the overall microcontroller growth and leadership position. Finally, in the area of microcontrollers, the Gartner Dataquest just published their microcontroller market share information for the calendar year 2007. The rankings confirm that Microchip remains firmly in the number one position for 8-bit microcontrollers, 24% larger than the number two company. We believe that the slower growth of the business that we experienced in 2007 was purely the result of our higher exposure to the housing and consumer market segments. But the growth and momentum we have seen so far in 2008, we believe we are continuing to gain market share through the combination of our strong product line offering and enhance demand creation initiatives. Moving to analog products, our analog business was up 8% sequentially achieving a quarterly record for revenue, many more opportunities that we have been incubating for some time started [ph] to ramp into production and we see more such designs poised to continue this trend in the coming quarter. We continue to be very encouraged by the level of designing activity and the breadth of customers this activity is occurring and for our analog business. Serial E-squared memory products, our business was down over 6.5% sequentially even though the pricing environment was more challenging, we maintained our discipline of not chasing low [ph] revenue growth. Let me now pass it to Steve for some more general comments and our guidance for the June quarter. Steve?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the March quarter, then I'll discuss the macro environment as we see it, and finally, I'll provide guidance for the June 2008 quarter. I am very pleased with our execution in the March quarter amidst challenging industry conditions. Our original guidance for net sales for the March quarter was minus 2 to plus 4% sequentially. We achieve near the high end of that guidance with net sales up 3.1% sequentially. We also achieved the high end of our gross market guidance and achieved an all time record high gross margin of 61.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Our original guidance for earnings per share was $0.35 to $0.38 on a GAAP basis and $0.39 to $0.42 on a non-GAAP basis. We achieved the high-end of the non-GAAP guidance and exceeded the high-end of GAAP guidance by $0.02. So, all-in-all, it was a very good quarter in which we resumed growth after two quarters of sequential decline. Now, I will discuss some macro environment as we see it. March quarter continue to validate the scenario that we have been painting for investors. By going into this downturn, two quarters ahead of the rest of the industry, we have left the worst behind us in the December 2007 quarter. Our March quarter was sequentially up and we expected... quarter to be sequentially up too. Many of our competitors have reported revenue declines in their microcontroller business units in the March quarter. This has been consistent with the scenario that we described for the investors where we were more exposed to consumer segment and saw the revenue drop in September and December quarters, while our competitors were more exposed to PC and communication segments and have now seen the drop in the March quarter. Microchip is seeing improving business conditions due to our own superior demand creation efforts. This goes back to 2.5 years ago, when we hired 150 direct sales and field application engineers working directly for Microchip, and we changed our business model with the global distributors especially Arrow Electronics. Some of the commentary we have seen about this change does not reflect an understanding of the reason for the change or appreciate the positive effects of these changes on our business. We believe that these authors have completely missed the tremendous positive effect of 150 direct sales and FAEs and a number of regional distributors we added who have been much stronger demand creators than Arrow ever was. The result of all this is that we have a very strong design in pipeline that we've have been incubating for some time. They are just starting to ramp into production and there are many more designs that are right behind in the next one to two quarters. We did not want to share the fruits of our own labor with Arrow, who has largely acted against us in the last two years. Therefore during the last quarter, we have terminated our relationship with Arrow. We have transferred all of that business in either Avnet Mamec, Avnet Silica or Future Electronics or one of our regional distributors. In the process, we have gained significant additional demand creation resources from Avnet and Future Electronics. We expect that there will be no negative effect of Arrow's termination on our business short term and there would be tremendous positive impact to longer term. While the result of these additional demand creation resources from Avnet and Future will be seen in four to six quarters from now. We are seeing the results of resources we added two years ago now. Our book to bill ratio for March quarter was 1.06. Our starting backlog for June quarter was 8% higher than our starting backlog for March quarter. We completed, almost completed really on our mark to finish our April as the best ever first month of the quarter in bookings. We are starting to see lead times on certain products push-out by week to week, and we are seeing very large number of expedites from the customers. We increased wafer starts in our fabs in March first time in the last nine months and we are preparing our assembly and test facility for the foreseeable rents. We're also mindful of continuing challenges in the U.S economy and its possible affect into the global economy. Taking all that into consideration and after our comprehensive review processes, we expect our net sales for June quarter to be 2% to 6% sequentially. Our growth is driven by strategic product lines. We expect 16-bit microcontrollers to be up 12% to15% sequentially in the June quarter and analog to be up 8% to 12% sequentially in the June quarter. We expect to achieve another record growth margin of about 61.6% to 61.75% on a non-GAAP basis. Now the earnings per share calculation has several moving parts. The dramatic reduction of interest rates from the Fed in March knocks a penny out of our earnings per share from the March quarter base-line. And we have assumed another rate cut after the Fed meeting this week which will affect EPS by another half a penny or so. These effects of lower interest rates are somewhat negated by 5.5 million shares of stock purchased in the March quarter which will have full effect in this quarter. On GAAP EPS the results will one time effect in March quarter which positively impact in March quarter GAAP EPS by $0.02. This does not repeat in the June quarter and with stock price moved above the strike price for $1.15 billion convert, it adds approximately 1 million shares to the share count. So taking all that into account, our non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.43 to $0.45 which is in the record territory and our GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.39 to $0.41. With that, Keith, would you please poll for questions? Question And Answer
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan.
Harsh Kumar - Morgan Keegan: Hey, Steve and Gordon congratulation guys, tremendous numbers and guidance. Just one quick question, Steve, could you give us an idea of perhaps by end markets, where are your backlog in orders of the strongest? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Harsh, basically with 60,000 customers worldwide, we no longer break that out. Lot of our customers are multi-national customers were build perhaps in all different types of products, consumer, industrial and other, with 65% or 62% of our business really being from distribution. It's very difficult to get the mix of where that product is going. So therefore, we really do not have any further commentary on end market mix.
Harsh Kumar - Morgan Keegan: Got it. Thanks. I will come back later. Thank you.
Operator: We go next to Romit Shah with Lehman Brothers.
Romit Shah - Lehman Brothers: Yes, thanks a lot. Just I wanted to clarify first, was Europe up 16% sequentially? And if so, how do you guys get comfortable that the customers in that region are not getting ahead of themselves?
Ganesh Moorthy - Executive Vice President: Yes, it was up 15.6% sequentially. This is always a very strong quarter of growth for Europe. Coming off the heels of the December where it is extremely negatively affected by the seasonal impact translates into this type of performance in our business. We are certainly mindful over customer base in Europe and as we compare the information we have available to us and consult it with our sales and channel partners, in Europe we have taken that into consideration in terms of our guidance for the coming quarter.
Romit Shah - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. And just a follow-up on the convert, Gordon, can you just explain how the math works now that the stock is above the conversion price. What's the dilution to the share count as the stock theoretically move higher?
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Well, as it moves above the strike price, first of all, you have to remember that this is an instrument that is settled in cash and is treasury waiting for... beyond that. So, it is the same treasury we think that is evident in EPS calculations related to our issue and stock options. We will continue to give the Street guidance on this, as we move forward to at least keep you in tune with what we see in terms of that dilution. If you have any modeling, as you go forward, you can see some of the impact obviously moving above the $34 and change conversion price. Obviously, we don't know where the stock price is going to land. Hence, we've given some level of a range in our guidance in the... in looking forward area of our press release.
Romit Shah - Lehman Brothers: If we assume like a $40 stock price, would that add about 4, 5 million shares?
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Not as high as that, I have to go, do the math offline. But I don't think it will take it up quite that high.
Romit Shah - Lehman Brothers: Okay, alright.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: The share count, it goes up [ph] very, very slowly. This is unlike a regular five year convert type where once it moves above the strike price, essentially you start looking at as converted and all the shares go back in. This is a 30 year convert, where the investor is having no right to ever put the stock back to us. So, it really accretes very, very slowly at the denominator [ph].
Romit Shah - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Yes.
Operator: We go next to Chris Danely with J.P. Morgan.
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan: Thanks guys. Hey, Steve, you gave a nice breakout of what you expect the relative growth rates from your different product lines through this quarter. Can you just talk what you would expect in terms of the product lines for the fiscal year in terms of relative growth rates?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: The fiscal year past or fiscal year coming?
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan: The one we are coming up on.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: I don't have that long-term guidance. We don't really ever give one year guidance, and to break it out by further product line, I can't. I would just venture to get that 16-bit will continue to do the kind of sequential growth we just talked about. And then you can model it your self. Analog is doing also quite strong, has legs on it, and that also could continue to do the kind of growth we talked about.
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And it is my follow-up. Can you just compare in contrast the linearity of the March quarter versus the June quarter?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: March and June quarters are
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan: So How are the bookings in March? Were they stronger at the end or beginning, and then how much of the June quarter is going to be done during the month of June, is it very back-end loaded?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Well there was... March quarter bookings at the end were very strong. March bookings were absolutely very, very strong. April bookings were even stronger heading for an all-time record for the first month of the quarter. June quarter is fairly a normal quarter where we have Chinese New Year in the middle, it is another Europe shutdown like August. It doesn't have a Christmas or Thanks Giving. So, this is the most normal quarter anyway.
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Yes, yes, it's okay. So, March linearity... the month of March was a higher component of linearity based on the Lunar New Year. June is pretty much marched on the week.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: So, this quarter will be rather linear than last quarter.
Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: We go next to Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS: Can you here me?
Operator: Yes sir, your line is open.
Uche Orji - UBS: Thank you. Steve and Gordon, I must congratulates you on these numbers, but let me just look at Q1 guidance again. First of all, I think if I looked at it guess historically, Q1 you tend to grow roughly around 6% sequential. So, when I look at your guidance of 2% to 6%, was commendable in this environment, I kind of think it's... the midpoint is below. Now, if given that Steve, you have been spot and calling the way things are turning, is it fair for us to assume that you feel very cautious on environment even though you have called the bottom for your stock. And if I look at it in context of it you totaled [ph] 10% growth for your company, annually, should I... how will I try to consolidate? And in the final what do you think it's limiting growth beyond just the current macro availability [ph]. That's probably my first question.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Well you have put three or four questions in there. Let's try to sort that out.
Uche Orji - UBS: Sure.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: First thing you said that our normal June quarter is a 6% growth?
Uche Orji - UBS: Yes.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: I think your data is wrong, because I don't recall, last year it was 2%, I don't recall the number year before. We probably haven't done a 6% sequential growth quarter in quite a while. If you do a 6% growth in a single quarter, there would be very, very high growth for the company. And where the markets are growing these days, 6% growth in one quarter would be exceptional growth not lower than the usual. So, I don't really agree with assessment. The second part of your question was, are we being conservative? I don't really know. I think the end results would tell what we were. My feeling is, no matter what guidance we gave over the course of the quarter, as we see a lot of investors. Some push for, why the guidance was so conservative and other push for why the guidance was so high, what's happening in the consumer segment with the headwinds, what's happening in Europe, but Uche your question was really leaning towards that with 15.6% in growth in Europe, are you comfortable Europe is okay. So, this is where we came out after substantial discussion and looking at a lot of data. And rest of it, you get to make the call what you want to believe.
Uche Orji - UBS: Just one more question. If I wanted to specifically push on that, on the market share. You're referring to government data and of course you are number one at [ph] 16%. But we have seen a few competitors grew quite fast if I look at those like Cypress for example, and even a couple of the Japanese, can you just give me a sense of what you're seeing within the competitive market? I mean the data you cited, the companies that grew very strongly, there are a couple Japanese names and of course Cypress has improved about 84% year-on-year. So what can you say about the competitive environment even though you're since already number one. How do you assess your position and especially in the light of what we're seeing from some of the Japanese competitors bouncing back and obviously Cypress?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Well, I can't pick and choose products in areas where in a narrow product line, you can really grow. We grew over 100% fiscal year over fiscal year in a 16-bit micro, and I can quote that too. And you can go try to compare with somebody who got a $1 billion dollar 16-bit business and ask him the question, how come Microchip is growing so fast from a small base and a narrow product line, you can't. If I look at Microchip's growth in certain portions of the 8-bit market and I wouldn't spell out what those portions are for comparative reasons, we had 80% plus growth in certain segments. We consider Cypress as a fairly narrow competitor, where majority of the businesses is in the Tucson's area. That's one area they have really done well. But, in that area plus many other areas, we are growing very, very high, but only $1 billion dollars of Microchip business, you don't get the airtime on a specific segment where we are growing 80%. We run out of time by the time we have talked about the broad beach [ph] front that we're trying to defend, a $1 billion dollar going forward. But otherwise, we have plenty of segments where we're gaining significant market share and where the businesses are going 50%, 60%, 80% and even 100% a year. Beyond that, the company you mentioned was down sequentially, what 30% in this quarter, quarter-over-quarter. So, you could have a single large customer drive the business significantly higher, then take a 25% to 30% sequential drop, Microchip's business has never done that. We have built our business very consistently dividing our business in a very broad array of customers. Top ten customers won't make up 10% of our business, and that's the thing that investors have come to accept from us, significant, predictable results. We had couple of quarters of problems last year, driven by unusual things happening in the consumer and the housing market. We got past that and our business is doing quite well now.
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: And Uche on the Japanese guys, if you go and look in history, these guys have very high market share in Japan. And in the years in which the yen strengthens, they will report much higher dollar term revenue, and in other years, they don't. Just go and look at the last four or five years for those same companies. So it has a lot more to do with the high presence in Japan, and the change in the exchange rate than it has to do with your market share performance on a day-to-day basis.
Ganesh Moorthy - Executive Vice President: And that translates to several of our European competitors, also exactly the same, comment, the weakness of the dollar translates into the reporting stronger Dataquest information, because they tend to be Euro-based and have a higher percentage of their business in any case in their own sphere of influence.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: We believe the entire market growth in microcontrollers as reported by SIA can the accounted for currency change in Europe and Japan, and there was really no real growth, if you were to really go back to the original currencies. Now that's for somebody else to verify but I've seen data to that regard.
Uche Orji - UBS: That's very helpful because I was wondering when the Japanese just decide to bounce back very strongly.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Its share to Japanese in any of our server markets anywhere in the world.
Uche Orji - UBS: Alright, maybe we can it offline possibly, and if I look at the data June '06 you did 6% and '05 and 5%, 11% in '04. So that's what I was referring, but I will figure offline with you. Thanks for your answers.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Okay.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will go next to Kevin Cassidy with Thomas Weisel.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners: Hi, thank you, and congratulations on a great quarter. Your growth in analog, it's the first time you've grown in about a year, can you say is it related to new designs went into production or is it... how much of it is attached to new microcontroller designs?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Well it's all related to lot of new design wins and I think the answer really goes back to what I described as really creating demand creation resources. We were with a structure before where a company like Arrow Electronics essentially had every single analog company they sell for. And we couldn't get share of mine [ph] being a small analog business. We couldn't get the share of mine [ph] in microcontrollers either, they were basically... the way to go to market was really whosever product customer wanted to use they simply sold their product versus truly selling the benefits of our products. So, when we added 150 sales and application engineers ourselves, a portion of those people added were analog experts in various different geography, application engineers which will engage with customers selling the benefits of our products. And with the design cycles and all that you are seeing really it's a result now with a lot of tailwind and you'll see that in this quarter, last quarter and the coming quarters is really we are back to growth.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, so some of these analog designs then aren't necessarily attached to microcontrollers, they are standalone designs.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Well, many are, many aren't, we don't really break it any more. I've described on this call before, we deployed a three phased strategy on analog, the first phase of our strategy which we implemented back in 2001 was to focus around our microcontrollers and try to attach analog products to the microcontrollers. The second phase is the strategy, which we started two, three years after the first phase, was now to start selling analog broadly into any microcontrollers. So if we didn't win the Microcontroller Socket, Freescale or Atmal [ph] or somebody else won it, we still going to be able to sell our analog. So we started to sell analog much more broadly into the general microcontroller market. And that one was quite successful. And the third phase of the strategy was to sell analog anywhere and everywhere in direct competition with TI, Linear, Maxim, ADI and smaller players. So, right now all three elements of the strategies are functional, and so therefore we don't really break it out what portion is attached versus not.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, and if I could ask one other question about the 150 new sales and FAEs you had, where are they deployed, percentage wise, can you say Asia, Europe and North America?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Well, after ten quarters I took the courage to tell the people, how many they were. I wouldn't want to provide any further breakdown and I didn't want to provide that because of competitive reasons, but I happen to do it because I think people on the call needed to understand where the growth is coming from in a very bad economic environment and how the change with Arrow affected and what we did and this is really what we did. Now, I am not going to further break it down regarding how many were sales or FAEs and what regions we deployed them.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Welcome.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeff Rosenberg with William Blair.
Jeffery Rosenberg - William Blair: Hi, you understandably sounded more cautious about the North American market versus the rest of the world, specifically can you talk about your expectations sequentially in June across certain geographies?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: We don't breakout the expectation further by geography; I did not mean to sound more cautious on North America, we have absolutely... the thing with North America is nothing really books here, so lot of the growth we are talking about, a good portion of it is coming from North American customers, but they are all buying in China. So, as we report the numbers like our last quarter growth in Americas was 1.6%, but that's really not real. I mean it's really... it's a customers who does the design in San Jose then buys the product in China. We report that into the growth in China, and that's really not right. There is just no other way to do it that's the only simplest way to really report at where the product was shipped, because the rest of the analysis is very difficult. So, no, we are not saying that the growth is not coming from U.S., lot of it is.
Jeffery Rosenberg - William Blair: Okay and
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Pre-designs.
Jeffery Rosenberg - William Blair: And if you look at the things that a year ago... and I realize this is several quarters back that were more on a drag, are they pretty stable right now and no real noticeable differences in terms of the various customers that you rolled together and those indices you provided us when you give clarity on the weakness in the North American market. Is that whole segment pretty much in line with the rest of your business at this point or is there still a little bit less growth their then elsewhere?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Well, there is less growth there, there is no growth there. You are referring to the U.S. housing index. I stopped reporting the U.S. housing index. As I had originally said I was only going to do it for a couple of quarters, because a lot of moving path, designs go away, new designs come in, you want to a brand new design so the dollar numbers look higher. But that doesn't really mean that segment is stronger, but without giving you the number, the U.S. housing index was minutely up.
Jeffery Rosenberg - William Blair: Okay.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Slightly up.
Jeffery Rosenberg - William Blair: Okay, thanks
Operator: We will go next to Craig Ellis with Citi.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Hi, thanks, nice job on the quarter guys. The first question is really a clarification. Steve, you mentioned that you are seeing some lead time stretching out and an increase in customer expedites, can you comment on how broad-based that is? And given the general concerns that we all have about the macro backdrop, do you think that's due to particular end market seasonality, the distribution model changes that the company has made in the past that are now starting to bear fruit or what's driving that increase?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: I think it's a combination of lots of different factors, I'm not sure there is anything to do with the distribution model change, there is, the total amount of inventory left at arrow on the way to being returned is of the order of what?
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: 3.5 million.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: $3.5 million.
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: In DC currency, so.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: So in the grand scheme of things, the amount of inventory which is really, on its way to being return. Therefore not being put to active use is really very, very small, we'll easily be able to replace that, if that was not available. So, it's really not driven by that. I think customers have gotten used to very short lead times. The product has been immediately available, nobody wants to commit anything, nobody wants to forecast anything. So, typically that's why in the entire industry, the visibility have been very low. And we reported our starting back lock was 8% better. So, we were getting strong orders for a [ph] near term product got booked because of those strong orders. So, now the customers who did not place their order wanted the parts like tomorrow, and they are being told they had to wait two weeks. So, that's the kind of thing we are talking about.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Okay, that's helpful. And then a longer term question. It looks like we've got pretty clear visibility toward the company getting to its cross margin target of 62%, but it seems like it's a longer gap to the operating margin target of 37 to 38%. Can you help us calibrate how we should think about the timing with which, how the company feels it can get to its operating margin target?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: The operating target margin we have shown recently has been 37%, approximately, 62% gross margin, non-GAAP by the way, 25% operating expenses non-GAAP, which will give you 37%. Where we are still farther apart is really on the operating expense line. We just reported a quarter at 26.8% non-GAAP, so we're 180 basis points away and the difference really has been not on the expense side but on the denominator, on the revenue side. With two quarter of decline of revenue that we saw last year, it really put that number in the negative direction. We were in the range of 25-25.5 before that, so we were lot closer. And if we had made the gross margin improvements and had not slipped back on the operating expense percentage we'll be in the striking range of that. Considering where we are, and it needs some good revenue growth for I would say six to eight quarters, to really get the operating expenses back in line.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Okay, thanks Steve.
Operator: We'll go next to Craig Hackenbach [ph] with Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, thank you. You mentioned that orders had jumped around a bit in Asia around the Lunar New Year, can you just discuss the other geographies of North America and Europe, how the orders progress through the March quarter?
Ganesh Moorthy - Executive Vice President: They performed well. We saw a good coverage in terms of our expectation on both our direct channel and our distribution network and that's continued into April also. So, no real surprises from that perspective they came in with decent linearity and obviously supporting the results we are delivering here.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. And just as a follow-up, I know you are not breaking out business by end markets, but do you have any comment... commentary around the comm end market in terms of some trends you are seeing within the comm space.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Comm space... that's the lowest exposure end market for us. Historically when we broke those numbers down comm was the smallest segment for Microchip for screen to battery charges for cell phones, and some coin phones and feature phones, and other stuff. That was the smallest segment for us and we have no further commentary on it.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to JoAnne Feeney with FTN Midwest.
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest: Yes, question about your auto efforts. I know that's a relatively new area for... and I am wondering if you could comment on how that's progressing?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Auto is not a new area for us. We have been in auto business for over a decade. And when we were breaking out the numbers, auto was approximately 18% of our business.
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest: And how was that... how have you seen that change over the last quarter, is that something that's picking up?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: There is no significant thing to report, like... we don't really break out the end market anymore. Auto didn't show anything positive to say or negative to say.
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest: Okay. And then just a housekeeping, couple of questions. Can you give us a breakdown of your interest income and your interest expense for the quarter?
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: I can't at the moment, just go to your next question.
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest: Okay. And then on the gross margin a bit, following up on a previous question. Over the next several quarters, what do you see as the potential drivers for further improvement in gross margins?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Well, we have you know guided longer term gross margin non-GAAP to be 62. We are guiding for the current quarter about 61.6 to 61.75. So, you got another 30-35 basis points left. The drivers are same that they have been for number of years now. There is higher volume, so better absorption, depreciation, roll-off, we are adding new capital slower than the old capital is depreciating. The richening product mix, higher percentage of the business being flash, higher percentage of business being analog, higher percentage of the business being microcontrollers, slower growth in memory, just lots of margin in.
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest: And then in terms of your relatively new relationships with Avnet and Future. I am wondering when do you see design creation activity with them really picking up? Do they have a lot of learning to do, in other words, in order to play a stronger role for you in that regard?
Ganesh Moorthy - Executive Vice President: Well, our relationship with Future is not new. Prior to this change, they were our largest distributor. The relationship goes back 18 years, so.
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest: No, on the Avnet side though?
Ganesh Moorthy - Executive Vice President: So, Avnet is newer relationship. We are in the process of training all these people now and like I said in my commentary, the new designs it will create will take about six quarters to revenue, but between now and six quarters lot of the growth from the 150 people that we added, 2, 2.5 years ago and large number of regional distributors we added back then which tool their 6-8quarters and lot of the revenue showing now.
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest: Okay. And any progress on the interest income or interest expense numbers?
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, the income is $12.1 million and interest expense is $6.3 million and the interest expense is all related to a convertible transaction and will continue at those rates as we go forward. The interest income is obviously determined by cash balances and safe fund interest rate changes that may effect our investment elements.
JoAnne Feeney - FTN Midwest: Okay, thanks. That's all for me.
Operator: We will go next to Eric Kobayashi Solo [ph] with Morning Star.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my call. Just wanted to go back to operating expenses for a moment. I am looking at the GAAP OpEx and noticing that they are growing a little bit faster than your revenue grew in the quarter. I wonder is there something there seasonally or is there some extra color to that?
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Well, the operating expenses sequentially from December to March quarter non-GAAP went from, I believe, 26.6% to 26.8%, 20 basis points. The entire amount was really driven by higher conversion in dollars from our expenses in euro and yen and Chinese and other currencies, and there was a little bit effect of higher reserve of the bonuses because March quarter was a lot better quarter, sequentially up, than December quarter was. December quarter was sequentially down. So, a little bit of higher bonus reserve, but large portion of it was really all currency changes.
Unidentified Analyst: I see. And I just wanted to ask a question about the 16-bit line. I wonder, are you seeing strong competitive response from some of the larger competitors against... if you compete against one of their divisions. I just wonder as you move into the 16-bit and 32-bit products whether or not these companies are fighting harder to keep your out?
Ganesh Moorthy - Executive Vice President: Our competition never has been easy to get share away from. So whether it's 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, competition is always been hard and we expect that. We see that on our 8-bit, on our 16-bit. So nothing different from what we would expect in terms of competition.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks very much, and congratulations on a good quarter.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we will take one final question from Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan.
Harsh Kumar - Morgan Keegan: Hey, I'm good. Thank you. All my questions have been answered.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, this does conclude today's question-and-answers session. I'd like to turn the conference back to your speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Well, thank you very much for joining us on this conference call. And there are a number of investor financial conferences we will be going to this quarter, and we will see you, some of that on that circuit. The next time conference is actually where Gordon is going to Merrill Lynch conference.
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Merrill Lynch on present on Tuesday.
Steve Sanghi - President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Thank you very much.
Gordon W. Parnell - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your phones at this time.

===== 2008 Q2  (2007-10-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to this Microchip TechnologySecond Quarter Fiscal Year 2008 Financial Results Conference Call. As areminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turnthe call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Gordon Parnell.Please go ahead, sir.
Gordon Parnell: Thanks Matthew and good afternoon everybody. During thecourse of this conference call, we will be making projections and otherforward-looking statements regarding the future events or the future financialperformance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements arepredictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We referyou to our press release of today, as well as our 10-K for the fiscal yearended March 31, 2007, and our 8-K current reports that we have filed with theSEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's businessand results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip'sPresident and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President. I will commenton our second quarter performance, reviewing geographic data and discussingbalance sheet and cash information. Steve and Ganesh will then give theircomments on the results, outline our guidance for the December quarter, andupdate other pertinent matters regarding our business. We will then all beavailable to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. So let's get going,  the net sales review for September, were$258.6 million, down approximately 2.1% from net sales of $264.1 million in theimmediately preceding quarter, and down approximately 3.5% from net sales of$267.9 million in the prior year second quarter. On earnings perspective, we are continuing to include someadditional information in our press release related to FAS-123R. Our non-GAAPresults exclude the effect of the adoption of this accounting standard, and inthe September quarter the financial impact of the sale of Fab 3 in Puyallup, Washington. Non-GAAP net income for the September quarter was $83.3million or $0.38 per diluted share, a decrease of 3.9% from non-GAAP net incomeof $86.7 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter.And the decrease of 1% from non-GAAP net income of $84.2 million or $0.38 pershare in the prior year's second quarter. We completed the sale of Fab 3 in Puyallup, Washingtonin October 19, based on the initial sale and purchase agreement that was enteredinto during the September quarter. The sale proceeds from the transaction were$30 million, based on the net value of the facility and normal cost associatedwith the sale of the property. The sale resulted in the pre-tax loss of $26.8million. The impact on the earnings, net of tax, was 7.4 cents. GAAP net income for September was $60.7 million, or $0.27per diluted share, inclusive of our share based compensation expenses and thesale of Fab 3 in Washington,I just mentioned. The impact on the earnings related to the adoption of share-basedcompensation in the September quarter was 7.4%. Take a look at our geographic information; both the Americas and Europe were down sequentially,while Asia was essentially flat. Americas wasdown 0.7% sequentially and was impacted by the economic conditions that wediscussed and indicated in our pre-announcement on October 8. Our results in Asia were similarly impacted from our initialexpectations. Europe net sales were impacted by the seasonal effects of businessclosures in the summer period in Southern Europe,mainly with net sales being down 5.8% sequentially. Asia continues to be our largest geography representingapproximately 44% of total sales, Europe was approximately of 29% of sales andthe Americaswere approximately 27% of sales. This measurement is based on where the productis delivered for manufacturing purposes, for our customers, but doesn'tnecessary represent with the design activity is taking place or where theconsumption is occurring. Looking at our operating information, initially I am usinggross margin and operating expenses information prior to the effects of share-basedcompensation, and also excluding the effects of the sale of Fab 3 for thisinitial discussion. Gross margins were 60.4% in the September quarter, close toour all-time high levels of the previous quarter. The sale of Puyallup will have positive impact on grossmargins in future periods, adding approximately 50 to 60 basis points to grossmargins. Operating expenses were 25.5% of sales in the Septemberquarter, essentially flat with the prior quarter, which were 25.4% of sales. Researchand development cost were $26.8 million, representing 10.4% of sales. Sales andgeneral administrative expenses were $39.2 million, representing 15.1% ofsales. And on a full GAAP basis, gross margins including theshare-based compensation were 59.8%. Research and development expenses andSG&A expenses combined were $72.3 million or 27.9% of sales. The tax rate for the September quarter was 20.4%. Our taxrate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and the percentage of ourcash that is invested in tax advantage securities. The tax rate for theDecember quarter on a GAAP basis will include a favorable settlement of a foreigntax matter of $5.7 million. Otherwise, the underlying tax rate is similar tothat of the September period. The dividend declared today of $0.31 per share, was anincrease of approximately 5.1% sequentially and an increase of 24% over thesame quarter in fiscal 2007. The dividend payment to be made in the Decemberquarter will be approximately $67 million. Turning to the balance sheet, Microchips inventory increasedapproximately $800,000 to $124.6 million in the September period, and it nowrepresents approximately 109 days of inventory. On the distribution side, our deferred income on shipmentsto distributors grew by about $3.5 million quarter-over-quarter. At September30th, distributors were holding about 1.9 months of inventory based onsell-through. Combining inventories on our balance sheet and thedistributors, they represent approximately 142 days of total inventory. Combiningboth elements would increase by about 4 days from the prior quarter. Microchip's receivables at September 30th were $125.9 million,a decrease of $1.4 million or about 1% from the balances at the end of June. Payment performance by our customers continues to be inexcellent shape, with minimum balances beyond acceptable terms. On the cash position at September 30th, Microchip hadapproximately $1.249 billion on the balance sheet at the close of the quarter.During the quarter, Microchip generated net cash flow from the business of$119.6 million. Payments related to our cash dividend of 0.295 cents duringthe quarter were $64.1 million. And the cash used related to our buyback of 4million shares, and was approximately $150.2 million. We anticipate building approximately $100 million inoperational cash in the December quarter, excluding the cash received from thesale of Fab 3. And we've purchased 900,000 shares in the current quarter inopen market transactions, using cash from the treasury in the amount of $28.6million. Our capital spending for the September period was $11.7 million. Depreciation expense for the September quarter was $25.4million versus $29.2 million in the same quarter last fiscal year, and $26.4million in the June quarter. Our capital forecast for fiscal '08 is currently 60 to $65million, and depreciation forecast is approximately a $100 million, again, forthe full fiscal year. Now I'll ask Steve and Ganesh to discuss the performance ofour business, our guidance for the December quarter and update other businessmatters. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you Gordon, and good afternoon everyone. I will nowcomment on the individual product lines, after which Steve will walk youthrough our guidance for the next quarter. Our microcontroller business was down just over 3.5%sequentially and was down just over 4% from the year ago quarter. While we'redisappointed with these results, we believe they are reflective of a weakmarket environment, and that our microcontroller product line and marketposition remain very strong. Our Flash microcontroller business was up almost 1%sequentially, and up 3.5% over the year ago quarter, and now represent over 72%of our microcontroller business. So, the drop in revenue in the Septemberquarter came entirely from our older one-time programmable products, many ofwhich are designed into legacy end-products, built for the housing and consumermarkets. Our new product development for over five years has almostexclusivity in Flash-based microcontrollers. Looking at our leading indicator, which is new developmenttool shipped, we shipped 26,344 development tools last quarter. This was asecond highest quarterly shipments ever, demonstrating the continued strongdesign win activity, and acceptance of our products. Moving to 16-bit microcontrollers, we were up over 6%sequentially and up 84% over the year ago quarter. Despite the headwinds in ouroverall, we were able to achieve another quarter of good sequential growth andexpect to post double-digit growth in the December quarter. 16-bit design win momentum and development tool salesremained very strong. We shipped 5,059 16-bit development tools in theSeptember quarter, the second highest quarterly shipments of development toolsfor 16-bit ever. This brings the total 16-bit development tools shipped to-dateto 36,776. Significantly, the number of 16-bit development toolsshipped in the first six months of fiscal year '08 was almost three times thenumber shipped in the first six months of fiscal year '07. During the quarter, we also released nine more 16-bitproducts to production, bringing the total number of products and productionnow to a 101, and we expect to have approximately 150 products in production bythe end of fiscal year '08. The number of volume 16-bit customers grew to 1,018 in theSeptember quarter, up from 897 in the June quarter and in terms of 16-bit customersof all volume that number remains in the several thousands. Moving to analog products, our analog business was flatsequentially and down just under 3% from the year ago quarter. Our analogproducts are designed into many of the applications that our microcontrollersare designed into, and experienced some of the same headwinds we saw in ourmicrocontroller business. The number of customers buying our analog productsgrew to 12,833 from 12,627 in the previous quarter. Our [Serial E2] memory business was up over 7.5%sequentially and was up over 1.5% from the year ago quarter. Sales were helpedby strength in the PC market segment, as well as normal seasonality in thisbusiness segment. Pricing declined moderately quarter-over-quarter. Now let me pass you to Steve for some general comments, aswell as our guidance for the September quarter. Steve.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you Ganesh, and good afternoon everyone. Today I wouldlike to first reflect on the results of the September quarter then I will discussthe thinking behind the sale of Fab 3 and the resulting capacity available toMicrochip. Then I will provide guidance for the December 2007 quarter. We experienced very challenging industry conditions duringthe quarter that led us to lower our guidance in the preannouncement of October8. I am disappointed that conditions in the U.S. housing market have continuedto deteriorate and some of the effects of the credit crunch have filtered intoour consumer segment outside of housing. We have seen these through theweakness in our Asian business, related to U.S. multinationals, the fracturingat Asian subcontractors. This has resulted in sequentially down revenue forMicrochip. I am disappointed by the market reaction to our pre-announcementon October 8 and I would have thought that the credibility that we haveestablished over many years would have stood for more in the face of difficultbusiness conditions. I am confident that future results of Microchip will vindicateus, and regain investors' confidence. One of the main questions in investor's mind is, isMicrochip losing market share? That question is not any different than the onewe have fielded at other occasions in the past when we missed a quarter,because of a significant disruption in the marketplace. Other similar eventswere the Asian financial crisis in 1998, SARS epidemic in 2003, inventorycorrection of 2004, and the military coup in Thailand affecting our operationsin 2006. At each of these occasions, the investor’s first reaction wasthat market dynamics have changed, and Microchip was losing market share. Yet,a quarter or so later all the other companies felt the same issue, and weshowed that we continue to gain market share. Some of these data are already beginningto appear. For example, Arrow Electronics, the second largest componentdistributor, this morning, guided their components revenue to be down betweenzero and 7.5% for the December quarter. With Arrow as a proxy for the semiconductor industry, youwill see this affect in many companies' results. Freescale just announced theirresults, and their TSPG Group where Microcontrollers are housed, was down 4.5%sequentially. Altera also just announced their results, they missed theirguidance too.  They were down 1%sequentially and guided down zero to 4%. Xilinx was also flat sequentially andguided down 5%. Both Altera and Xilinx recognized revenue at sell-through, fromdistribution, just like Microchip does Now, I saw some hints of softness in Texas Instrumentsnumbers too, however they are sell-in revenue recognition, which cushions theirresults a bit. So, we are also starting to get some correlation with sell-in versussell-through revenue recognition companies. Now in the past at such occasions investors also felt that Microchipsgross margin was not sustainable, as we have shown our gross margin hascontinued to hit new highs after each of these events. At each of these eventsour inventory also rose and investors felt that an inventory write-off wascoming, yet Microchip did not write-off inventory, because the lifecycle of ourproduct is very long. We are facing one of those events again, and there is plentyof data around. Our housing starts have been cut in half. All the companiesexposed to this sector; home builders, lenders, transportation companies, andothers, are feeling the pinch. We have detailed the impact on Microchip througha U.S. housing index, as well as examples of several customers on a no-name basis,that were down 17%, 20% and 26% sequentially. We have also shared the data fromappliance design magazine, showing how far some of the end applications are,like air conditioners, heat pumps, furnaces, residential water heaters andcooking equipment. And now with data coming from Arrow Electronics, Freescale, andXilinx, it points to the economic softness spilling over in other segments aswell. So in spite of these challenging conditions, we will continueto focus on our business and continue to make improvements. So that as thehousing and consumer sectors stabilize, we see strong growth in our business. So let me give you an update on some of the things that weare doing. First, the sale of Fab 3, there was a culmination of several factorscoming together. Now Fab 3 was not listed for sale, although some of the excessland around Fab 3 was for sale. We received an unsolicited offer for the wholesite. Secondly, we are qualifying a new proprietary technology inFab 4, which significantly extends the available capacity in our two Fabs. So, we now believe that our current equipment set will takeus to $1.6 billion of revenue, with nominal capital equipment additions. Andwith further equipment additions in Fab 4 and some in Fab 2, we can take thetotal capacity in our two Fabs to $2.2 billion. Thirdly, we're having good success in producing several ofour products in foundries. We believe that the capacity available from thefoundries will take our available capacity to $2.5 billion and beyond.Therefore, as we received this unsolicited offer in Fab 3, we believe that wewill not be using Fab 3 for many years into the future. In addition, with many leading-edge technology companiesgoing to 300-millimeter, the large number of 200-millimeter Fabs, fully-loadedwith equipment, will become available to purchase at very economic prices inthe future. Therefore, we decided to close the sales transaction on Fab 3. Theresult will be a 60 basis-points improvement in our gross margin and about$27.5 million additional cash in our treasury. Number two, we are continuing to introduce new 16-bitmicrocontrollers at a rapid pace. We have significant momentum on this productline. Despite significant headwinds, we were up over 6% sequentially and upover 84% over a year ago quarter, and we expect the double-digit growth in16-bit microcontrollers in the December quarter. Number three, despite short-term revenue and earningscompression, we are continuing to increase dividend paid to the investors atthe current dividend rate and the stock price, The dividend is about 4%. And number four, we have said for some time that our stockbuyback plan is opportunistic. We purchase stock when we think that theinvestors no longer understand the story and have thrown out the baby with thebath water. We believe that now is such a time, therefore we have beenaggressively buying back stock which Gordon has detailed for you. Now let me provide you guidance for the December quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio for September quarter wasapproximately 0.94. December quarter is also a seasonally weak quarter forMicrochip. With customers in-housing and consumer segments uncertain abouttheir businesses, we expect many customers to take longer vacations andschedule shutdown days over the holidays. Therefore, we expect our December quarter will be downsequentially because of the level of uncertainly. We are providing a widerrange of guidance than normal. We expect our net sales to be down between zero to 6%sequentially. We expect to achieve record gross margin of 60.8% to 61.1% on anon-GAAP basis, and a non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.35 to $0.38. With that, Matthew, would you please poll for questions?
Operator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conductedelectronically. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from RomitShah with Lehman Brothers.
Romit Shah: Thanks. Steve, you provided fairly wide guidance for theDecember period. Could you just run through some of the swing factors thatcould get you either to the high end of the guidance or the low end ofguidance?
Steve Sanghi: Well, Romit swing factors really are customers' behavior. Wehave seen in prior cycles when the customers' businesses are soft, many of themhave fiscal years ends and when the businesses are soft, they use holidays totake extended shutdowns or close down the operations or clean their operatingplants, and we're hearing some of that in our conversations with the largercustomers, but those plans are not firm. And we have seen in the last quarter, from some of thecustomers we met, that they told us what they were going to buy in the quarter,many of them were down significantly to that expectation. So, customers don'tknow themselves in this timeframe what they are going to do, because they arerelying on their businesses doing better and their end customers buying. And when the segment confidence in the housing, consumer andother segments continues to slip and you are starting to see that happening nowin some of the other segments through Arrow and Altera and Xilinxannouncements, which were not available at the time of our preannouncement, andmany investors felt that we had a stand-alone problem. We can now start to seethat there is some company there. And so believe our customers don’t know and it will reallydepend on customer's plans and behavior really where those numbers will comeout.
Operator: Our second question comes from Chris Danely, J.P. Morgan.
Chris Danely: Thanks, Steve. Hey, Steve, now that we're sort of workingaway through these things, how do you compare this downturn or correctionversus the previous problems we've had, and I guess the reason I ask is that,assuming that the December quarter is down that would be three out of fivequarters with negative growth and I think the only other time that happened wasthe tech bust. So if could just take a step back and kind of compare this timeright now versus the previous downturn?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the tech bust was driven by PCN communication sectorand this particular bust at least for us was driven by housing and consumersegment. But during the tech bust in average PC, communication company was down50% to 90% in revenue and in this segment we assume the people in the housingand consumer segment down 20%, 40%, 50%, although not as much down as in thetech bust. Now, if the company was exclusively exposed to that segmentalone then we will be down as much as some of the home builders are 50%, 60%,70%. We are actually up year-to-date, if you look at the numbers. We were up 3%in March, then we were up 2% in June, and we were down 2% in September. So year-to-date we are still up 3%. That is whatdiversification is doing. We are exposed to many different sectors and sodiversification does work, but when a single segment is not just soft, goesdown 4%, 5% it's busted, it's down 50%. At that point in time with significant exposure to thatsegment, some of the numbers we have posted, I think they are unavoidable, butthe numbers do show that the diversification does work. And I can't image acompany in the PC and communication sector, if their sectors were down 50%,those companies will be down similar, and we are up 3% year-to-date. So take iteither way you like.
Operator: And our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with GoldmanSachs.
Simona Jankowski -Goldman Sachs: Hi. Thanks very much. Steve, just curious if you can updateus on your book-to-bill, I know it's not always a good predictor, but you didsay it was about 0.94 at the time of your preannouncement. And if we were justthe kind of flat line that, so it imply a minus 6% guidance at the mid point. I am just wondering if you've either seen an accelerationsince your preannouncement or if your expecting one to give a guidance range that'sa a little bit above that kind of a mid point?
Steve Sanghi: Well, Simona, you may remember from, dozens of conferencecalls our book-to-bill never correlates to the end revenue we achieved, wenever had. There are a number of time when book-to-bill as one and we achievedsignificant sequential growth and when the book-to-bill is less than one and wedo better, much better than that. So, we have never found a good correlationbetween book-to-bill and actual number, so.
Simona Jankowski -Goldman Sachs: So, suffice to say that we shouldn't reach our guidance asyou having seen some kind of improvement or acceleration in the trend you havetalked about a month ago?
Steve Sanghi: No, I notes or any of my colleague's notes didn’t point toany change in business. We were down 2% and we are guiding down 3 at the middlepoint in 0 to minus 6. So we don't want you to read anything other than what weguided.
Simona Jankowski -Goldman Sachs: Sure. And then, I definitely agree with whatever you aresaying about pointing to Arrow and Altera and some of the other negativeearning's reports coming out of semis. I did want to ask you about a couple ofspecific comments made by some of the other component suppliers, one was fromFairchild, actually pointing to pretty positive trends in their white goods businessand then TI microcontroller business specifically was pretty stable. Justcurious if you can contact us for may the trend and exposure you have versusthose particular competitors?
Steve Sanghi: Well, this is another phenomena that we have seen at numberof these events and I highlighted to a little of that in my commentary.Fairchild, TI both these companies recognized revenue at sell-in, whilemicrochip recognizes revenue surely at sell-through worldwide. And we have seenin numerous times the ability it gives the companies to manage the revenue in asell-in situation by simply asking distributors to take little more inventory. If you were take outward inventory build at the distributor'slast quarter. If we have recognized that for revenue then our results will bebetter too. And we have seen many of these companies, they just fall harder,because they can't really build that inventory forever when distributioncorrected in the phase of weakening condition. So, Arrow guiding 0 to minus 7.5, what you think they willbe doing with their inventory. And you will see that results spillover to allthese companies who are sell-in revenue recognition companies. We have seenthis music so times that I am reasonably confident that you will see that, andwe are starting to see it already.
Simona Jankowski -Goldman Sachs: Sure, that's fair. And then just last quick question is oninventory at your end customers. One of the trends that I'd like to track isthe microcontroller shipments relative to the long-term trend line, and we haveseen a pretty significant divergence in the last few quarters wheremicrocontrollers are well above the long-term trend lines. We often look atthat as an indication of inventory build at the end customers. So just curious if you have anyway of kind of checking your-- I know you have a lot of fragmented and small customers, but do you have asense whether some of their reduction in their orders and forecast are a resultof them reducing their own inventory in addition to their demand weakening?
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh, do you have any sense of that?
Ganesh Moorthy: My sense is that customers never really know, and it's verydifficult to discern softness in business versus changes in inventorypositions. So as best as we can tell, they don't tell us they are decreasingtheir inventories. We know that they are building less and that's why we seeless orders on us.
Simona Jankowski -Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi: Simona, I would add that softer build rates at the customersand inventory reduction is really tied at the hip. Anytime a customer startsbuilding less because of weaker demand for their end customers, the firstimpact they see is they find higher raw material inventory, based on what theyhave to build. So, part of the reduction always is an inventory correction,because their end product demand is weak. So, I've not been able to separatethem in the past, and I believe they are really joined at the hip.
Simona Jankowski -Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: We have a follow-up from Romit Shah with Lehman Brothers.
Steve Sanghi: Hi Romit.
Romit Shah: Hi, Steve. Arrow talked about Europeslowing down or not coming back in September and that trend pretty muchcontinuing through October. That was the one region that came in line with yourexpectations. Are you expecting Europe to growin the fourth quarter, or would you expect it to be down at the other regions?
Steve Sanghi: We're usually fairly cautious in Europeevery summer because of the European holidays. We've seen that so many timesthat we usually do not count on Europe reallyto be up in the summer quarter. So even though Europe was down 5.8%, which wasmore down than any other geography around the world, we simply said that wecounted on that Europe is always down. So Europe was quite weak. And as far as December quarter is concerned, we haven'tbroken it down, but I don't believe we are counting on Europeto be up in December.
Gordon Parnell: No, I think Europe tends tohave as it gets into middle of December a lot higher percentage of ourcustomers and the distributors get more extended normal seasonal vacation time.So that's a fact that we're considering here also.
Romit Shah: Okay. And if I could just lastly, does your long-term grossmargin target change with the sale of the Fab?
Steve Sanghi: No, it really does not because long-term target we kind ofcounting on either using it or selling it. And we no longer believe that we'regoing to use it for many years, because we have figured out a way to extendexisting fabs much longer, based on the numbers you have heard before in termsof what the capacity was. That number is a lot higher today based on lot of the thingswe have done in technology. So, our long-term target, no, it doesn't notchange.
Romit Shah: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: And we have a follow-up from Chris Danely with J.P. Morgan.
Chris Danely: Hi, thanks guys. Can you hear me?
Operator: Your line is open.
Chris Danely: Okay, great. Just making sure you can hear me. Hey, Steve,do you expect the OTP microcontrollers to continue to trend down. Can you justgive us a sense of what do you think is going to happen in that part of yourbusiness going forward?
Steve Sanghi: The OTP microcontrollers have been kind of trending downslowing for long time, because even though the life cycle of our products isvery long, after five years of not adding any products in that eventually havebeen rolled off. But, growth at the flash microcontrollers has been making itup quite significantly. Last quarter, we sequentially grew only 1% in flashmicrocontrollers because of challenging business condition. So it did not override the decline of OTP, and the decline of OTP was also more severe becausesome of these products were in older models and older legacy products, that'swhere the customers are correct when they are not building enough products. Sowe will expect OTP to continue decline but not certainly at the pace we sawlast quarter.
Chris Danely: Sure. And you've always maintained that you would ratherkeep your margin then chase after this sort of higher volume lower marginopportunities. So if you were given the choice and things start to get a littlebit more competitive, would you rather lose some share in certain areas ofmicrocontrollers and keep your margins high, or would you choose to -- if youwould impact your growth rate, would you choose to maybe get a little bit moreaggressive on pricing and sacrifice a little bit on the margins side?
Steve Sanghi: Chris, I have not faced that situation in the microcontrollerbusiness in 15 years and I won't expect that would happen. We will continue togain market share with excellent gross margin. So, I don't need to look at the hypothetical,because I don't think that it will happen.
Gordon Parnell: We have always said, we have got many levers in the grossmargin side and we have always talked about using some of those cost advantagesback at the marketplace to make it more uncomfortable for competitors. And that'swhat we have been dealing with for years and so it does not really change.
Chris Danely: Okay and that leads to my last question. Now that you guyshave given guidance, if you look at the total years 2006 and 2007, when you getbigger competitors in 8 bit Atmel has roughly doubled your growth rates. Sowhat gives you confidence that you are not losing share to them.
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, the share is calculated as the share of the overallmarket. If you look at one year, two year, five years, ten years, or any periodof time, we have substantially outgrown the market. The numbers I have lookedat from 2001 to today, we have outgrown Atmel in 8-bit micro. Now, you can really pick a different timeframe, and pickyear the year or two year, or any period in time and one company of the othercompany could come on top. But we are -- you lose share when you are going lessthan the market. We have never gone less in the market.
Chris Danely: Okay, thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: The other think I would say Chris is that the generalfeedback we are receiving from investors and some of the analyst commentariesthat somehow there are tremendous market pressures on us. Your gross marginquestion hinted towards tremendous pressure that we somehow crash on ASPs orsomething like that. We like to show you that we are not seeing any of that. Thebusiness is stable. It is good, other than the issues we have identified andconsumer in other markets. So our gross margin last quarter was excellent. Weexpect it to go higher this quarter. We are able to handle the normal decline in ASP’s and allthat we’re seeing through the normal avenues we have available of costreduction, yields, new technologies, depreciation rolling off and all theadditional benefit of really not paying for the Fab 3 sitting idle. So, I liketo really put your concern to rest that seized by the market forces of Atmel oranybody else.
Chris Danely: I would like to put my concerns to rest too.
Steve Sanghi: I wish there was more I could help you with.
Operator: And moving on, we will hear from Craig Ellis with CitiInvestment Research.
Ken Sill: Hi, thanks for asking my question, this is Ken Seil callingfor Craig Ellis. Steve, when I look at the overall annual growth rate from fiscal’03 to fiscal ’07, it’s around 12%; they are expected to be flat for fiscal’08. How should we think about the , on the intensity if you want to get backto that level of growth rate? And also, is that the same type of growth ratestill reasonable level to expect going forward?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I’m sorry I haven’t been able to figure out, inaccurate growth rate that I would like. Last one or two quarters you wereasking the projected years out. I really have no ability to do that.
Ken Sill: Okay. And then may be switching gears a little bit. When Ilook at the sequential growth in analog, its slowed quite a bit over the pastsix quarters or so, based on our model. Should we expect to see some return toprevious growth rates within analog, despite some of the near term headwinds oris there need to be a small acquisition to support that level of growth that wesaw in fiscal ‘06?
Steve Sanghi: I think that’s a good question, analog is a good questionand something we're pondering over ourselves. I think the growth in analog wehave found it challenging. We've had reasonably good years, last year was agood year, we were up 24%, we grew the year before. However, staring from theinventory correction it happened in December quarter when most analog companieswere down. Most analog companies were down even in the March quarter. Ithink we saw significant issues with our analog also. And our analog businessis also somewhere tight to really where we sell our microcontrollers becauselot of it is selling to same customer. So our analog exposure is also somewhat like ourmicrocontroller exposure in similar segments. So that has been hit by housingand consumers and those kind of things also. So having said all that, I wouldaccept that we are finding the growth in analog challenging, and we'reinternally looking at ways to really boost that.
Ken Sill: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And moving on we will hear from Jeff Rosenberg with WilliamBlair.
Jeff Rosenberg -William Blair: Hi. Steve, could you elaborate a little bit on your use offoundries, how much of your business, have you increased the amount ofopportunity you see in outsource manufacturing? And what sorts of products areyou thinking make sense to go that way?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I don’t know if I can give that detail, but onequestion you asked is how much of our business is foundries today? It's fairlysmall, it's under 5%. But the key question in the foundries for Microchip hasbeen since, we have not historically used foundry can we be successful at thatmodel, can we successfully develop products, can we add enough of our own IP tomake the resulting products come out at a gross margin, which could meet theMicrochip model rather than since the foundries make gross margin, would thatsubstantially lower our model. We have worked through those challenges and have found thatwe can successfully develop products, analog and microcontrollers and another,basically products in all different segments, where it will cost significantprocess development inside Microchip, substantial R&D investment insideMicrochip to develop those products inside Microchip. We are now found that we can take these relatively smallerbusiness plans and since we don't have to develop the technology portion of theR&D, we can go to foundries. We can actually build an equally successfulmodel with them, as we are achieving with our overall business. So, there are good number of products, which have beendesigned, which have been released to production, they're ramping. So ourfoundry portion of the business is growing and we think in the next five years,it could be 10% higher depending on the success of those products. So, I thinkthat's the difference.
Jeff Rosenberg -William Blair: Okay. And then a second question on inventories with thatlooking like a tracking to about a 120 days this quarter, I mean can you giveus some feel for what level of revenue you need to get back to before you feellike you can start to bring that down, and how we should think of that relativeto what it means for your gross margin over the next few quarters?
Steve Sanghi: Gordon
Gordon Parnell: I think the sort of break-even position is about $260millionish a quarter in terms of inventory sale. Below that, we are going toadd somewhat to our inventory balances at this point.
Jeff Rosenberg -William Blair: Okay, thanks.
Operator: And moving on, we will hear from Gil Alexander with DarphilAssociates.
Gil Alexander -Darphil Associates: Good evening, Steve, can you give us some guidance at thispoint as to the dollar sale of your 16-bit or you rather hold off at thispoint?
Steve Sanghi: Gill, I would rather hold off, I think it seems to be verycompetitive information about somebody who will pay money to get that.
Gil Alexander -Darphil Associates: Fair enough. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: I appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with ThomasWeisel Partners.
Kevin Cassidy -Thomas Weisel Partners.: Thank you for taking my questions. Lotof my questions been asked but, is the -- who bought the Fab 3, can you saythat?
Steve Sanghi: It was sold to a developer essentially who is going to dosomething with the excess land, something with the building, and something elsewith the fabs. So he was really not a semiconductor manufacturer.
Kevin Cassidy -Thomas Weisel Partners: Also the fab will be taken out a commission.
Steve Sanghi: That's been out of commission for many years, it was just anempty show.
Gordon Parnell: We don't really know what the purchasable will do with thesite.
Kevin Cassidy -Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And moving on, we will hear from Kevin Rottinghaus with ClevelandResearch
Kevin Rottinghaus: Thanks. Could you give us an indication that maybedistracted you see the memory market, was that is attributable or is that allthese end market base or something else going on?
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh
Ganesh Moorthy: Your question is about the memory market?
Kevin Rottinghaus: Yes.
Ganesh Moorthy: You know memory always has a seasonably strong Septemberquarter. So, some of the strength we saw last quarter was attributable to that.And as you seen, we have memory sales that go in to some of the officeautomation market and we saw some of the strength in that segment reflect inthe memory as well. So, those are the two combinations of factors in lastquarter's memory results.
Kevin Rottinghaus: Okay. And with I guess forecast for continued strength inPCs, would you expect that segment continue to track well for the Decemberquarter?
Gordon Parnell: The various factors, so segment strength is only one, thereare other seasonality factors and memory usually has seasonal weakness as itgoes into the December quarter based on other market segments that it sellsinto as well.
Kevin Rottinghaus: Okay. How about the percentage of revenue throughdistribution this quarter?
Gordon Parnell: 64% to 0.65% so not a whole.
Kevin Rottinghaus: Stayed the same.
Gordon Parnell: Big shift.
Kevin Rottinghaus: Okay. And then any changes on headcount or could you give usany kind of update on headcounts since the last K?
Gordon Parnell: There is no real significant change in terms of overallheadcount for the business at this point in time.
Steve Sanghi: Factories are flat, sales force has built, divisions arewell staffed, there is minor changes here and there, any replacements ifsomebody leaves or minor adds here and there, but under business conditionswe're really not growing headcount anyway.
Kevin Rottinghaus: Okay. Just last question for me, just strategically, do youany thoughts kind of on the need to be more involve in kind of the 32-bitmarket or you kind of comfortable with the product portfolio as it is speakingeither near-term or long-term?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we are a microcontroller supplier and when we used toget that question on 16-bit, we couldn't answer it similarly because we don'twant to give a hint to any other competitors what we might do in future, buteventually we did the 16-bit, and the financial result is we will eventually dothe 32-bit, but we can give an hint of when we might need it. Our products today dsPIC and PIC24 16-bit products areextremely competitive in the 16-bit world, our 16-bit architecture, whichactually is 24-bit wide inside and 16-bit on the output side. Its 50% faster inperformance compared to ARM7 which is a 32-bit architecture. And so we have apowerful architecture revenue share. We compete with 32-bit microcontrollerseveryday with our 16-bit and come out winning lot of times.
Kevin Rottinghaus: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instruction) Moving on John Pitzer with CreditSuisse.
Amit Saraf: Thanks. This Amit calling in for John. Just outside of theconsumer industry in 3Q or the consumer ad market, I mean do you believe yousaw any unusual strength that might have offset the consumer weakness or evenin the early days of Q4 here? Was there any unusual activity in any of yourother end markets?
Gordon Parnell: I think that there nothing particularly that stands out. Ithink some of the segments that’s have seasonal strength. In the third quarterwe saw strength too. So you have seen companies that are PC exposure who haveseen some of the strength there. We have similar strength in that segment inthe third quarter, but nothing out of the ordinary that I would call out.
Amit Saraf: Okay, and then--
Steve Sanghi: My general answer really would be that -- we're ahorizontally structured company that serves to 58,000 customers around theworld and we are really usually not segment focused unlike many companies we'reorganized by the end market segments and build special products for endsegments. We do no special products for consumer or communicationsegment or BC segment. Our products are standard, catalog kind of products thatgo horizontally across many markets. So, most of times, we don't really knowwhere we are selling, because we are not organized sold that way. 65% of abusiness is really through distribution and lot of times, we don't really know,where it is going. We have provided you some special inside look on thishousing segment, that required a lot of work and painstakingly, we created anindex for you to give you inside as that sector was sort of getting invested.But that isn’t translate to really our inside knowledge into any of the othersegments.
Amit Saraf: Okay. Understood. And then I guess the thoughts and I guessits difficult, but may be you can answer the second question. I mean, just as aballpark estimate I know a lot of your products go through distribution andit's hard to estimate. But could you say what percent roughly of your businessgoes to consumer today and may be what percent roughly is exposed to U.S.consumer or the areas seen some of this extreme unique weakness in themarketplace?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the U.S. consumer has been 35% or so of our businessand we don't really know what portion is U.S. consumers, because fair amount ofa product built in Asia another place is really lands up being in U.S. and getsold to consumer. Secondly, even though we highlight consumer to be 35% of ourbusiness, there are many other applications that have consumer likecharacteristics, is a battery chargers for a cellular phone, a communicationproduct or a consumer product is a radar detector for an automotive, a consumerproduct and an automotive product is a radio and a car, a consumer product andan automotive product. So I think these are very overlapping application and weare in every single of those of applications. So if you look at just brand consumer I think you arelooking at a consumer behavior than consumer is two third of the economy,everybody knows that. And so we really see that going to affect in our businessand U.S.consumer is really half of the world’s consumption. So those are big numbers. But again, I come back to what I said earlier, despitechallenging conditions in that large of a market segment numbers are downslightly and if you look at our guidance its starting to now correlate with lotof a companies who have even less exposure on the segment, which is trying totell me that some of that sentiment of consumers and corporate executives inthe industrial segment and communication segment is starting to filter into theentire thing.
Amit Saraf: Understood, no I think it was helpful to hear yourdefinition or view of consumer, which we are starting to witness. Thank you.
Operator: And we do have another question in the queue, this comesfrom Doug Freedman with AmTech Research. Doug Freedman -AmTech Research. Hi guys thanks for taking my question. Some of them havebeen answered, but if you can also give your view at the analog and tax rateand what is happening with some new entrance into the microcontroller arenawhere we are seeing more programmable solutions that incorporate integratedanalog. Can you offer your view there and what you see the outlook andopportunities for Microchip to benefit?
Steve Sanghi: Microchip to benefit in analog?
Doug Freedman -AmTech Research: In building integrated circuits that have both the analogand microcontroller, not just working for analog attached.
Steve Sanghi: 90% of Microchip’s microcontrollers have analog on them. Socomplaint could come from outside. Just focus on just that segment and call itsomething different than a microcontroller, and at a small base it could growand it could look for a while, but Microchip ships close to over $700 millionto $800 million of revenue in microcontrollers, which has a substantial amountof analog on it. We have lots of those products in our portfolio also and havehad them for years.
Doug Freedman -AmTech Research: So, is this an area that you expect to be growing, or is itsomething that you're going to focus more energy on, is there…?
Steve Sanghi: We don't really make a microcontroller today that doesn'thave a substantial analog on it. Our microcontrollers at Microchip are not puredigital engine microcontrollers. I don't believe we had made anymicrocontrollers in the last several years, and over 90% of Microchip'smicrocontroller portfolio and probably over 85%, 90% of our revenue inmicrocontroller, are microcontrollers with substantial analog on it. Ratherthan system on a chip I call them system on a peak SOP.
Doug Freedman -AmTech Research: Okay, great.
Steve Sanghi: To many of the customers we refer to those peakmicrocontrollers as system on a peak because they have all the required analogon it also. I think that's partially also we find that customers where, whenMicrochip goes with a microcontroller seeking design, many times the analog onit customer lands up using it on our microcontroller. And therefore, we may notwin that analog circuit. But if the customer was using somebody else'smicrocontroller maybe didn't have as much analog, was purely a digital, thenyou could find an analog part from Linear or Maxim or TI or somewhere. And I think part of our analog challenge is really driven bythe most of our analog IT is also available integrated with ourmicrocontrollers. So therefore every time we go if the customer needs amicrocontroller and in analog, the analog gets cut out because we bundle itwith a microcontroller. Does that make sense to you?
Doug Freedman -AmTech Research: Yeah, absolutely. As a result of that, do you think thatthat's part of the opportunity that you have in terms of seeing sort of ahigher ASP per system, and if they are more of trend to incorporate more analoggoing forward to get more system [on tech]?
Steve Sanghi: I think we're -- Ganesh, do you want to comment on that, Imean that's what we have been doing for years.
Ganesh Moorthy: It's what we've been doing for a long time and if you lookat our product line progression, the complexity of analog that we haveintegrated has just gone up overtime, and clearly some of the reasons why weget the gross margins that we get to get the ASPs that we get is because of theoverall system value we are bringing on these systems on effect.
Steve Sanghi: So if the market share we have gained for years and years inthe phase of a flat or declining EBIT market for years -- when we were growing,we were adding value essentially, putting lot of analog and improving ASPs. Andso it's not something new, I think that's on the top of the list in terms ofwhat we're doing, adding analog and other peripherals on our microcontrollers.
Doug Freedman -AmTech Research: Okay, excellent. Changing gears a little bit. Can you talk alittle bit about your good market strategy? I know you've in the past changedyour channel strategy from time to time. Can you give me a summary of howcomfortable you are with how it's working right now and what your view of itis, is it something that you're looking at maybe possibly trying to find toomany ways?
Steve Sanghi: The channel strategy is working well. Initially the reactionof some of the channel partners was negative based on us loading gross marginand taking some of that and pulling them into demand creation effort, and someof that was misunderstood by some of the channel partners thinking thatMicrochip will take all that business direct. And after two years plus, two to four years depending onwhich phase of that program you talk about, where we started it four years ago,a market share gains have continued. Last year was a record gain of marketshare. Channel partners have reengaged, because Microchip didn't take all thatbusiness direct and they thought our business from distribution is still verysimilar, it's almost 65% than we were had four five years ago. So, I think there is always room for improvement and gettingmore effort from all of its channel partners, no matter where they are. Andusually nobody is ever satisfied because in this business you got to ask formore and we'll continue to do so, but there is really no -- the channelpartners are not broken, those relationships are not broken.
Doug Freedman -AmTech Research: All right, treat. Thank you for your time.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. Iwill turn it back over to Mr. Sanghi for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you very much everybody for attending. We'll see someof you on the road, as we travel to various conferences and explain our marketposition further and I will talk to you in the next conference call. Bye, bye.
Operator: And once again this does conclude today's call. Thank youfor joining us and have a great day.

===== 2008 Q1  (2007-07-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to this Microchip Technology first quarter fiscal year 2008 financial results conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Gordon Parnell. Please go ahead, sir.
Gordon W. Parnell: Thank you very much and good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter 2008 conference call. During the course of the call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Microchip. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, and our 8-K current reports that we have filed with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President. I will begin by commenting on our first quarter performance, reviewing geographic data and discussing balance sheet and cash information, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, outline our guidance for the September quarter, and update other pertinent matters regarding our business. We will then all be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Net sales for the June quarter were $264.1 million, up approximately 2.3% from net sales of $258.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up approximately 0.6% from net sales of $262.6 million in the prior year’s first quarter. Our earnings, we are continuing to include additional information in our press release related to FAS-123R. Non-GAAP results exclude the effect of the adoption of this accounting standard. Non-GAAP net income for the June quarter was $86.7 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, an increase of 6.6% from non-GAAP net income of $81.3 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter, and an increase of 6.5% from non-GAAP net income of $81.4 million, or $0.37 per share in the prior year’s first quarter. GAAP net income for the June quarter was $80.3 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, inclusive of all share-based compensation expenses. The impact on earnings related to the adoption of share-based compensation in the June quarter was 7.4%. The results by geography in the current quarter were mixed. Asia net sales increased by 9.7% sequentially, while the Americas were essentially flat, growing 0.5% sequentially. Europe net sales were down 5.4% sequentially in the June quarter after being up 19% sequentially in the March quarter. Asia continues to our largest geography, now representing approximately 43% of total sales. Europe was approximately 30% of sales and the Americas was approximately 27% of sales. This measurement I’m using is based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes for our customers but doesn’t necessarily represent where the design activity is taking place in our business. Looking at operating P&L information, I am using gross margin and operating expenses information initially prior to the effects of share-based compensation. Gross margins were 60.6% in the June quarter, reaching new record levels. Operating expenses were 25.4% of sales in the June quarter, an increase from 24.5% in the previous quarter. Research and development costs were $27.2 million, representing 10.3% of sales. Sales and general administrative expenses were $39.9 million, representing 15.2% of sales. Gross margins including share-based compensation were 60% and total operating expenses on a GAAP basis, again after the effects of share-based compensation, were 27.8%. The tax rate for the June quarter was 20.3%. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax advantage securities. The dividend that we declare today of $0.295 per share was an increase of approximately 5.4% sequentially and an increase of 25.5% over the same quarter in fiscal 2007. The dividend payment that will be made in the September quarter will be approximately $64.5 million. Now, turning to the balance sheet, our inventories in the June quarter increased approximately $2.8 million to $123.8 million. It is now representing approximately 107 days of inventory. Distribution inventories on the balance sheet fell $1.5 million quarter over quarter and represent approximately 1.8 months based on a sell-through characterization. Combining inventories on our balance sheet and at the distributors, they would represent 138 days of total inventory. Both elements of inventory measurement being essentially flat in days from the prior quarter. Microchip's receivables at June 30th were $127.3 million, an increase of $2.7 million or 2.2% from balances as of the end of March. Payment performance by our customers continues to be strong, with minimal balances beyond terms. Our cash balance, our cash and total investment position was approximately $1.3 billion as of June 30th. During the quarter, Microchip generated net cash flow from the business of $126.2 million. Payments related to our cash dividend of $0.28, or $61.1 million. Capital spending for the June period was approximately $25 million. Depreciation expense for the June quarter was $26.4 million versus $28.1 million in the same quarter last fiscal year, and $27.9 million in the March quarter. Our capital expenditures forecast is currently $70 million and depreciation forecast is approximately $105 million, both for fiscal 2008. With that, I will ask Ganesh to discuss the performance of our business and Steve will then follow on from there. Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Gordon and good afternoon, everyone. I will now comment on the individual product lines, after which Steve will walk you through our guidance for the next quarter. Let’s begin with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was up 2.5% sequentially and up 1% over the year-ago quarter. While we were not satisfied with these results, they should be viewed in light of market conditions as reflected in the microcontroller business results announced so far by competitors like TI and Freescale’s TSBG group, which is the relevant group for microcontrollers. Freescale TSBG experienced a year-over-year decline in the microcontroller business, while TI was flat year over year as compared to Microchip's modest growth. And on a sequential growth basis, Freescale TSBG was about the same as Microchip, while TI’s microcontroller business was also flat sequentially. Our flash microcontroller business was up 3% sequentially and up 10% over the year-ago quarter. Flash microcontrollers now represent approximately 69% of our microcontroller business. Notably, we shipped our 2 billionth flash microcontroller during the last quarter and believe that this is by a significant margin the largest number of flash microcontrollers shipped by anyone. Looking at one of our leading indicators, we shipped 28,294 new development tools last quarter, which was another all-time record. The record shipment of development tools demonstrates continued strong design win activity and acceptance of our products. Moving to 16-bit microcontrollers, our 16-bit business was up 24.5% sequentially and up 165% over the year-ago quarter. Our 16-bit design win momentum and development tool sales remained very strong. The number of volume 16-bit customers grew to 897 in the June quarter from 735 in the March quarter, up almost 22%. In terms of 16-bit customers of all volumes, that number is in the several thousands. We shipped 8,290 16-bit development tools in the June quarter, the highest quarterly shipment of development tools ever. This strong growth in development tool shipments reflects strong design-in activity augmented by broad, worldwide customer training programs that Microchip has been running. This brings the total 16-bit development tools shipped to date to 31,717. We now have 92 16-bit microcontrollers in production and expect this to grow to be about 150 products by the end of fiscal ’08. Moving to analog products, analog products were up 1.7% sequentially and were essentially flat over the year-ago quarter. The number of customers buying our analog products grew to 12,627 from 12,147 in the previous quarter. For Serial EEPROM memory products, net sales were up 1.3% sequentially. Pricing declined moderately quarter over quarter. After our pre-announcement in June, our Serial EEPROM business performed slightly better than our expectations. We were expecting a sequential decline at that time but instead we pulled off a small sequential increase. Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments and our guidance for the September quarter. Steve.
Steve Sanghi: Thanks, Ganesh and good afternoon, everyone. Today I would like to first reflect on the results of the June quarter, then I will discuss the guidance for the September 2007 quarter. We experienced very challenging industry conditions during the quarter that led us to lower our guidance in the month of June. We met that guidance and were up 2.3% sequentially. We achieved another record gross margin of 60.64% prior to the equity expense charge, and we also achieved an operating profit of 35.2% before the equity expense charge. This quarter also makes the 67th consecutive quarter that we have been profitable, a testament to the resilience of Microchip's business model over many, many business cycles. We shipped a record number of new development tools, indicating strong acceptance of our products and strong design win activity. Before I go into the guidance, I want to give you an update on three factors that led to the pre-announcement during June. The first of these was the impact of a dramatic slowdown in the U.S. housing. New housing starts in the U.S. saw a dramatic decline during the start of the calendar year 2007 and Microchip products usually get bought a few months into the housing build cycle. Therefore, we saw the impact of it during our June quarter. Then we took 10 large U.S. customers and we created a U.S. housing index. Two of these customers build garage door openers, two build air conditioning equipment, two build appliances, two build security systems, one of these customers builds thermostats, and the final one builds irrigation equipment. Our sales to these 10 large customers was down 14.2% sequentially in the June quarter. Therefore, from the base of the March quarter, we created sort of a U.S. housing index for Microchip of 85.8. 85.8 is 100 minus 14.2, which our business was down sequentially last quarter. I must caution you that customers move their designs around from U.S. to Asia, and various new designs go to production. As we are gaining share at these customers, the business can increase with the new designs going to production. In addition, it is difficult to split the volume that contract manufacturers sometimes assign to the U.S. housing, so this index is not very meaningful even just to a couple of quarters out. But over the very short-term, we believe that we can track these 10 customers to give you some insight into where this segment is headed. Ordinarily, due to a large number of customers that Microchip serves, our revenue is fairly stable. At any given point in time, one end-market is going up, another end-market is going down and we have thousands of customers in each end market. It is really very hard to track any end-market segment very meaningfully. However, with a 14.2% decline in this segment, we had to call it out and it affected our guidance by about one percentage point. By now, you have seen the reports from Sears, Home Depot and Homebuilders confirming the issues related to the U.S. housing market. Now, the other point is despite being down in the U.S. housing area, our overall business in the U.S. was slightly up in the June quarter, as Gordon mentioned. We were up about 0.5% overall in the U.S., which gives you the diversity of lots and lots of customers, that even after this segment being down 14.2% sequentially, we were up slightly in the U.S. The second factor in our guidance was Europe, which was down 5% in June after being up 19% in the March quarter. The Europe sector did actually slightly worse, even after our pre-announcement. We believe that Europe will continue to be weak this quarter, due to seasonal factors. The summer quarter because of the European holidays, they are always sequentially down in the summer quarter. The third factor was Serial EEPROM, which actually did slightly better than we expected after our pre-announcement, as Ganesh mentioned. So it already did better last quarter and it continues to further stabilize. With the update on those three factors, now let me give you the guidance for the September 2007 quarter. As we looked at the September quarter, we took several factors into account. We looked at our own bookings and business activity in various product lines. Our book-to-bill ratio for the June quarter was 0.99, very close to parity but not quite one. The U.S. housing activity is expected to stay depressed with all the sub-prime mortgage mess that we hear about every day. Europe is expected to stay seasonally weak for the summer quarter, so therefore we expect our September quarter net sales to be about flat to up 2% sequentially. Gross margin for the September quarter should be flattish at about 60.6%. Earnings per share are expected to be about $0.39. The earnings per share is without the share-based compensation expense. EPS with share-based compensation expense should be about $0.36. We expect to build approximately $100 million of net cash flow before payment of $64.5 million of dividends that we just announced today and we look forward to sharing this cash with investors, with another increase in dividends in the next quarter. So let me summarize a few key points. Our net sales are expected to be flat to up 2% sequentially and without the equity expense, compensation expense, gross margins are expected to be about 60.6%, operating expenses to be about 24.4% to 25.6% of sales, and earnings per share are expected to be about $0.39. With that, Shirley, would you please poll for questions?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We’ll take our first question from Craig Ellis from Citigroup.
Craig Ellis: Thanks and good afternoon, everybody. Just looking at some of the details of the business, in analog it looks like, at least in our model, that that business is growing a little bit more slowly than it did back in calendar 2005. With the strength in the 16-bit business and microcontrollers overall, do you expect reacceleration as you move into the back-half of the year and next year?
Steve Sanghi: It is correct that the analog business this year has grown slower than it grew back in 2005. If you compare it to really where all the other analog companies are coming in, every single company is actually still down year over year. Microchip's business is not down year over year in analog, although growing slower. That was the first part of your question, but the second part is does it accelerate with more 16-bit. We do have larger dollar content around 16-bit applications with our own analog products versus with 8-bit products. Number one because there is more analog around it and number two, 16-bit application is a new world, so there is not an incumbent and we can get in first, while in 8-bit applications, some other analog guy may already be there. So driven by all those factors, yes, we are doing better with attachment with the 16-bit, and as the 16-bit business gets larger and grows further, gets significantly meaningful, it would help accelerate the analog.
Craig Ellis: That’s helpful, Steve and then with regard to the outlook, in the just completed quarter, there was broad-based growth across the different product lines. Do you expect the modest growth that you are guiding to to be similarly broad-based?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, I mean, as we look at internally, we are only guiding flat to 2% so it is pretty hard to triangulate but internally, none of the divisions currently are looking at a negative. Now, when you are zero to 2, these are small numbers but we don’t really look at any division to go down substantially in any way.
Craig Ellis: Lastly for me, given the 5%-plus dividend increase relative to the revenue growth, it seems like you are saying that you view the revenue deceleration as a temporal issue. Is that correct?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. We basically understand that the revenue deceleration is coming from the significant impact of the housing market and that somehow filtering over to the rest of the consumers. Europe, which is usually seasonally slow -- but the longer term, as we have said before, we have not tied the growth in dividend to growth of revenue or earnings. Investors have asked us do we have a ratio in mind and we largely say that no, we do not have a ratio in mind. Our cash earnings continue to be substantially ahead of really the GAAP EPS earnings and therefore, we are committed to continue to increase dividends for well into the future and are not deterred by temporary interruptions of a quarter or so, driven by cycles or events.
Craig Ellis: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Next we’ll hear from Michael Masdea from Credit Suisse.
Michael Masdea: Thanks a lot. Steve, ever since you switched your accounting and moved to a sell-through, you’ve done a very good job of managing the inventories, et cetera, but it does like Europe got a little out of control, given the growth last quarter and the fall-off this quarter. Is there anything from a systems perspective or anything different that you are doing that maybe caused that to happen, that we can prevent that in the future or am I missing what happened over there?
Steve Sanghi: I think you are missing the change from sell-in to sell-out really was our distribution, where we do not recognize sales through distribution as revenue until distribution ships it out. When we changed it back in 2003, Europe has always been based on sell-out. That change in 2003 was made in Asia. In Europe, we have been at sell-out for the last -- ever since we have been public and even before. If this Europe negative inventory issue we are talking about is really either at the European OEM customers or customers or our distributors. We did not have a higher distribution inventory in Europe and that distribution inventory did not change in the last two or three quarters. We just had a significant growth in sell-out and distributors were giving us a significantly higher forecast regarding what the sell-out would have been in the June quarter, and distributors did not really realize that sell-out because they saw some inventory correction at their end customers where they had shipped a lot of product in January.
Gordon W. Parnell: You know, the backdrop for Europe, Europe has been very strong for several quarters. I think if we look back over the last two fiscal years, it has been probably the strongest geography that we had at Microchip. It is certainly possible that the end customers of our distributors, with that as a backdrop, perhaps got ahead of themselves in some way in terms of what they saw as demand from their own economy and perhaps some of those factors have affected it. But certainly our ability to have any changes in that end-market, the customers’ demand in the distribution channel, is really based on their own outlook on their business, the economic factors they see at that point in time.
Steve Sanghi: If you look at some of the results that have come out from distribution so far, they are really pretty lukewarm. [inaudible] results haven’t come out yet but Arrow’s results have and the June quarter was essentially flat and was down 2% last year, and for the September quarter they are forecasting their components business to be minus 4.3% to up 1%. So the distribution is not forecasting very good results overall for their components business, so --
Michael Masdea: That’s helpful. I appreciate it. Gordon, on the lead time front, what were your lead times? The reason I ask partially is because some of the -- I guess a few of the analog companies at least have seen some extending of lead times. I wanted to see if yours have stretched at all and also if your competitors or some of the -- might not be the right word but some of the others out there, if their lead time is stretching, is that impact the bill of materials lead time at all?
Gordon W. Parnell: Our lead times are three to five weeks and really haven’t changed substantially over the last few quarters. It is certainly with longer lead times in different parts of the board, it is possible that can have an impact on the business differently. The fact that we have shorter lead times perhaps results in us not having as much backlog visibility in some way, shape or form. And so, you know, it is an inter-related board that our customers are trying to populate.
Michael Masdea: Last quick one -- you guys filed a lawsuit against Shanghai Haier. I just want to understand what kind of impact per quarter in terms of spending. Is it material? Secondly what is your ultimate goal, given that can be sometimes a tougher route to go for a lot of the U.S. companies?
Steve Sanghi: The impact is really very small. These things take a long time. Some of the customers we have litigated in Taiwan in the past can take years, so it is really nothing. There is no short-term impact on expenses of any kind. They are trivial. As it gets well into it, these are not mega-lawsuits like you’re used to with some other U.S. company to U.S. company. It is really on a very small segment of products and longer term, we have taken similar actions against customers -- no, not customers, sorry -- several competitors in Taiwan very, very successfully. We took an action similarly against a U.S. company years ago. The company used to be called Phoenix Semiconductors and they don’t make those copied products anymore, so our success in enforcing our intellectual property has been relatively pretty good and that’s why we’ve enjoyed very, very good margins over long periods of time. Here, we are not talking about the entire Microchip portfolio. Our product line is very, very vast. It is really at the bottom end of older microcontrollers that Microchip has been making for 10, 12 years now where there is some breach of intellectual property, and in due time we’ll take care of that.
Michael Masdea: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next we’ll hear from Chris Danely from J.P. Morgan.
Chris Danely: Thanks, guys. A question for Steve of Ganesh -- have you guys talked to those 10 customers, sort of housing related, that pushed out in the June quarter? And if you have, what are they saying about their September quarter? Are you getting any commentary from them regarding their inventory levels or how long this is going to last?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, yes we have. Basically they are not very confident in their own forecast because they read the same headlines like all of us read, and just today’s over 300 points market drop in the middle of the day, largely the headlines I read were driven by housing and sub-prime woes and so on and so forth. The customers are forecasting this quarter to be sequentially down on their own business for those 10 customers that I mentioned, so the U.S. housing index, as I -- don’t try to correlate that to a U.S. housing index that you may hear from homebuilders and anybody else, because within these 10 customers, we may have additional designs going into production, people moving to Asia -- it is just really complicated. But rather than not having anything, I try to really take a judgment and try to give you an indicator, which could give you a feel for really how our business is doing at these 10 customers. In the September quarter, that business is expected to be sequentially down.
Chris Danely: Okay, and then Steve, you raised the dividend and clearly you are still confident in the business model. I’m just curious as to why you wouldn’t be buying back more stock.
Steve Sanghi: I think we have said many times before that we buy stock really at occasions when we feel that stock is substantially under-priced, to the point where the market has thrown the baby with the bathwater. Last time, I’ve given examples before, the last time it happened was during SARS, where a significant event happened and Shanghai and Beijing were ghost towns and our business was very substantially impacted. But the market reaction of that was somehow we lost the recipe and the market has gone to 16-bit and our margins were not maintainable and so on and so forth. We haven’t seen really that kind of reaction in the market this time. It seems to be investors understand what is happening and housing is a well-known phenomenon. It is being talked about every day. Having said that, where the stock has come down from the highs of 42 before, and depending on what the market reaction is in the coming days, there is -- you know, the board has a chance to really rethink that and trigger that any time they feel it is reasonable. We have a large amount of stock buy-back authorization in place and we are not going to signal to the investors when we start acting on it.
Chris Danely: But it is fair to say if we get another 15% sell off, you guys would think of stepping in?
Steve Sanghi: That would be signaling. That would be giving you a definitive answer. I can’t give you a definitive answer at what point and time the board and management will meet and think it is the right time.
Chris Danely: Okay, thanks.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Next we’ll talk to Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski: Thank you. I think in the past you’ve indicated that consumer is about a third of the business. I know it is difficult to track how much of it goes into the U.S. versus overseas but is there any guideline roughly you can give us of how much of your business overall is exposed to the U.S. consumer?
Steve Sanghi: One thing we want to separate is the consumer versus housing, because consumer versus housing are not the same. Housing we are look at things that go into new housing -- appliances, security system, thermostat, air conditioners, garage door openers -- that is housing. Consumer could be anything, you know? Stuff we sell into things consumers buy and all sorts of electronics and entertainment and other equipment. That is not related to new U.S. housing. Some people have asked what is that exposure to U.S. housing? It is very hard to figure that out but I believe our guess is somewhere in the 7% type of range. How we arrive at that is really by looking at these large customers and roughly looking at -- there is a huge tail but roughly what portion of the business is the 10 customers that I talked about. These 10 customers that I talked about are slightly over 3% of our business, so if you just double it, take care of the long tail, it really gets in that range. I don’t know if that really helps you but investors shouldn’t confuse U.S. housing to U.S. consumer. U.S. consumer is still doing well, and you are right -- a third of our business worldwide is consumer but our U.S. overall business last quarter was slightly up.
Simona Jankowski: That’s very helpful. That’s exactly what I was getting at. Just related to that, the U.S. housing market has been weakening for a while, so I’m just kind of curious from your perspective, has the decline been pretty similar in the last two quarters and it is just that in prior quarters, other parts of the business like Europe were strong enough to offset it so it wasn’t observable from the outside? Or is it because that this quarter in particular, the deterioration accelerate?
Steve Sanghi: I think you answered it. We serve 60,000 customers around the world and we’ve been gaining market share tremendously. As you know, Dataquest numbers on 8-bit microcontrollers, our competitors were down last year and we were up nearly 15%, so with that kind of market share gains and a very broad base of customers, we are often able to take the impact of a single segment. At any given point in time out of 60,000 customers, there are customers going up and customers going down, customer who win against their competitors and customers who lose against their competitors. Sometime we’re on both sides of the equation, so we don’t win or lose but other times, we have a customer who loses in their end market. So these kind of phenomena happen all the time. It is a large number and our revenue is very stable, but this was a very dramatic change, number one and the change came in parallel with really another factor in Serial EEPROM and another factor in Europe. And at the top of when most companies are announcing year-over-year negative growth in an otherwise difficult, challenging market, you couldn’t take all of that together.
Simona Jankowski: Thank you.
Operator: Next we’ll hear from Sumit Dhanda from Banc of America Securities.
Sumit Dhanda: Steve, I had a question for you. If you sort of look at your normal seasonality in the September quarter and the five-year average is about 4%, the 10-year average is about 5%. So the delta versus that seasonality is, depending on what frame of reference you choose, about three to four points. Any sense you can give us as to where that delta or what that delta is attributable to? It seems large. Is it just that the backlog and the book-to-bill is not where you would like it to be to be able to guide to normal seasonality?
Steve Sanghi: It is really all of the above. Backlog, but more than the backlog, I think I have historically said that we don’t really rely much on backlog because whether the customer who places the order on the 25th of June or gives it to us on the 7th of July, it doesn’t really make any difference. I think the biggest issues are the housing market is still going down and we know from this segment that we’ll have another negative indicator. Europe would be down this quarter, driven by Europe and any time the market is weak, it can go down more than you think it can go down in a given segment. As we look at the guidance from the rest of the industry, just in the last quarter the Semiconductor Industry Association, Dataquest, InStat -- everybody has dropped the overall semiconductor growth for 2007 into very low single-digits, like 2% type. It used to be 7% to 8%, which basically means with half the year ahead, which means they are not optimistic on the second-half of the year. Just this week earlier, STMicroelectronics dropped their 2007 industry forecast down to 1.8% from a number which was 5%, 6% type. I think people in general I think are a bit more pessimistic about the second-half of the year, and therefore all that is accounted in the guidance in the September quarter.
Sumit Dhanda: I don’t want to belabor the point but just as I dig through this, you indicated that your housing exposure is about 6%, 7% and your exposure to Europe is about 30%. It almost seems like you would need to see declines of the same magnitude you saw last quarter to see that two or three point delta. Is that the right way to think about it, your housing exposure is down sequentially another 15% and maybe Europe declines another 5% or 7%? Is that what you are baking into your forecast?
Steve Sanghi: I don’t know how to split that out in so many portions but I think when you are trying to triangulate back to an average of the last X number of years being 4% or 5%, your basic assumption is starting from that the industry conditions today are average of the last 10 years, and from there you are trying to subtract out a specific effect of housing or Microchip specific. I don’t believe that the industry conditions are average right now. I think the industry conditions are below average. I am looking at guidance and announcements from most companies. I think Microchip is one of very few companies that are up year over year. Companies like TI and [Xilinx] and [Altara] and [inaudible] announced today and a bunch of large companies. They are all down year over year and they are not talking about huge growth. Everybody’s talk has gone down in an announcement for the last 10 days. I don’t think that you should start from an average industry condition of Microchip growth to be 4% to 5% and then try to subtract the specific factors. I think you have to take a good sized judgment that the industry conditions are not average.
Sumit Dhanda: On a different note, either you or Ganesh could answer this question, in terms of your 16-bit microcontroller products, not as a percentage of revenues but as a percentage of your design portfolio, which I think you have disclosed in the past, has it moved substantially from the 25% type number? Is there an update you can give us on that metric?
Ganesh Moorthy: I am not sure we have provided that metric. Are you referring to --
Steve Sanghi: He’s looking at the number of products, like we have 92 products out of the total.
Ganesh Moorthy: In that sense, it is probably close to that same ratio. We have about 450-ish total microcontrollers. 16-bit is about 100, a little bit less than 100, about 92, somewhere in that range. So it’s in that 20%, 25%.
Sumit Dhanda: Would you expect an acceleration in that in the near future? I would assume so, or if not --
Ganesh Moorthy: As we invest in 16-bit, we are not dis-investing 8-bit, so we still have substantial 8-bit investment, substantial market share yet to gain. You will continue to see a steady drumbeat of 8-bit products from us, even as we bring out a substantial number of 16-bit products. In terms of acceleration, we’re telling you you should see us close to 150 products by the end of our fiscal year ’08, so that’s 50% more than where we are at today.
Sumit Dhanda: Thank you very much.
Operator: Next we’ll hear from Jeffrey Rosenberg from William Blair.
Jeff Rosenberg: I wanted to follow-up on that 16-bit question as well. Of those 92 products, how many of those have been it the market for -- I don’t know if two years or more would be the rights sort of timeframe to think about when they’ve had a chance to start to ramp to a reasonable volume of revenue. How would you look at it that way in terms of kind of by class, how many of them have been in the market long enough where they are reaching that point?
Ganesh Moorthy: Very good question. So there is probably one-third of them that have been around for more than two years. A lot of the newer products have come out and are still in their design cycle. The early customers may have gone to production but there are many, many more that are in the incubation stage that are not yet in production.
Jeff Rosenberg: Okay, thanks. And if I could ask one more, Steve, in terms of parsing things and looking at different segments, how -- do you think Asia will have a growth rate that is somewhat softer than you would have normally expected as well? I mean, just thinking about the non-housing related consumer and the ramp seasonally, are you seeing that or is that muted as well?
Steve Sanghi: A lot of the U.S. customers produce in Asia, so our Asia number really has a substantial amount of export from Asia back to the U.S., so if you are looking at some pessimism here then yes, it will reflect in the Asia number too. The numbers we have internally baked in for Asia are a bit lower than I would have like to see.
Jeff Rosenberg: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Next we’ll hear from Kevin Cassidy from Piper Jaffray.
Kevin Cassidy: Thank you for taking my call. You had mentioned that the Serial EEPROM, the business got better after the pre-announcement. I wanted to know what changed that made that business get better. Did ASPs go up?
Steve Sanghi: No, it is not that the ASPs went up. I think a significant portion of our business is always distribution, which we only recognize when we get a distribution sales report and we don’t have it all the time. We get these periodic reports and I think in the final, as we tally the numbers, the distribution sales out were slightly better. Some time even if you get an earlier flash report, we get a total but we don’t really get a breakdown by each product line, so distribution says okay, I sold out so much. They don’t really periodically give you a breakdown of every product line every week. When we finally got that number in early July, there was a bit more business, I believe, Gordon, of the type of $0.5 million plus?
Gordon W. Parnell: $0.5 million to $0.75 million.
Steve Sanghi: $0.5 million to $0.75 million more had moved in the category of Serial EEPROM. This business is what, a $30 million business, roughly per quarter? So that is sizeable and that can change it from slightly negative to slightly positive.
Kevin Cassidy: What percentage of the memory business goes through distribution?
Steve Sanghi: Very dissimilar to really what the rest of it is.
Ganesh Moorthy: Two-thirds of it is through distribution.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay, so since it was through distribution, were you able to tell what market segment it was?
Ganesh Moorthy: Our memory business is very similar to the rest of the business. It is a very broad-based number of customers, applications, markets it goes into. There is nothing unique about memory in one market segment.
Steve Sanghi: I must say that this $0.5 million to $0.75 million change from one product line to another product line, E-squared to micro, micro to E-squared, analog -- they happen all the time. They happen every quarter but they don’t get the scrutiny. We don’t really forecast for you what every product line will grow every quarter. We give you the numbers at the end and we see the change internally. This is a -- we are talking about a $1 billion business and 60,000 customers. These kinds of changes happen all the time. Now, coming off a quarter where we had a negative pre-announcement, we know the investors are anxious to really know more and we work hard to provide you a bit more on the U.S. housing index and Serial EEPROM and all that but these are trivial changes in general over time.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay. I was just looking for what the changes were. Thank you.
Operator: Our final question comes from Uche Orji from UBS.
Uche Orji: Thanks. Can you help me -- I know you’ve talked about this whole housing thing but if I look at the other sub-segments, were there any areas where you saw strength that you thought was notable, at least just for us to get a sense, a proper sense of what are the areas where there have been some improvements. That may be interesting for us to know.
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know, we manage our business by product line divisions, not by end markets.
Uche Orji: Of course I know that.
Steve Sanghi: We do not have an end market, we don’t have -- we don’t have an organization selling into communications or selling into consumer or selling into office automation. Our products are standard, programmable products, exactly the same microcontroller can be used in a cell phone, in a automobile, in a toaster or blender, in a washing machine and a garage door opener. The only difference is the customer has designed it differently in those different application boards, so therefore our approach to market is very horizontal in nature. We can tell you really how product lines did and we are telling you that the 16-bit product line was the runway winner, with over 25% growth, and the other product lines were essentially all were close to, you know, weaker. But we can’t tell you by end market. We saw a significant impact of housing and it took a lot of work to bring you some data and we have done that. But with 60,000 customers and hundreds of end markets, in general don’t manage it that way.
Uche Orji: Fair enough. I understand that. I just was hoping that given how much in housing, we could perhaps get some insight in other areas. But let me ask you a different question -- when I look at Europe, you had a strong performance in March and then things have kind of slowed down. Do you think that the seasonal impacts we have seen out of Europe may be somehow amplified by an inventory correction, given the strength we saw in March? Do you think so?
Steve Sanghi: Is the impact amplified by the inventory correction?
Uche Orji: -- strong performance in March, and then --
Steve Sanghi: I think we admitted that. I don’t know whether you joined on the call late but we talked about that it is possible that the distribution over-shipped to their end customers over a period of time and there was a very, very strong growth in March, 19% growth sequentially, so the end customers were already bullish, the distributors were very bullish in terms of the forecast they were giving us and those forecast were not realized.
Gordon W. Parnell: If your question is about next quarter, I think there is not an overhang from the --
Uche Orji: That’s my question, actually, yes.
Steve Sanghi: Because he was asking --
Ganesh Moorthy: There is no amplification going into the September quarter.
Gordon W. Parnell: If you look at the GDP and other factors in some of the leading economies there, they still are strong. This could certainly have been some level of an overreaction from our OEM and distribution end customers that rectified itself here, or represented itself, I should say, in the June quarter.
Uche Orji: That’s helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Due to time restrictions, the question-and-answer session has ended. I will now turn it back over to our speakers.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you very much and we will see you on the road as we go to various conferences. Thanks.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2007 Q4  (2007-04-27 18:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Q4 and FY2007 financial results conference call. As a reminder today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Gordon Parnell. Please go ahead, sir.
Gordon Parnell: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 2006, and our 8-K current reports that we have filed with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President. I will comment on our Q4 and full fiscal year performance, reviewing geographic data and discussing balance sheet and cash information, and Ganesh and Steve will then give their comments on the results, outline our guidance for the June quarter, and update other pertinent matters regarding our business. We will then all be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions after the comments. To facilitate the review of the information this afternoon, we will be using some PowerPoint slides. You should already have access to those slides. I would also suggest that having the press release available will enhance your understanding of the information we’ll be sharing today. With that, let’s move on to slide two. Our net sales for the March quarter were $258.2 million. They were up 2.9% from net sales of $251 million in the immediately preceding quarter and up approximately 4.5% from net sales of $247.2 million in the prior year’s Q4. Next I would like to comment on our earnings for the quarter, so moving to slide three. In the detail in this slide, we are providing GAAP and non-GAAP information. I want to focus on the non-GAAP initially, excluding the effects of share based compensation and the tax benefit related to a tax settlement as indicated in the press release. Gross margins were a record 60.52% for the March quarter, up 24bps from the December levels of 60.28%. With this result, we mark the bottom of our gross margins in this cycle in December, which were only off our previous highs by 17bps. Opex for the March quarter were 24.52%, down 21bps from opex in the December quarter. R&D costs increased $600,000 in the March quarter compared to the previous period, and SG&A costs increased by $700,000 QoverQ. Operating income for the period was $93 million, or 36% of sales, an improvement of 45bps from the December period. For the purposes of the non-GAAP presentation, a tax rate of 24% was used, that tax rate being in line with the prior guidance we had given the street. Non-GAAP net income for the March quarter was $81.3 million or $0.37 per diluted share, an increase of 3.3% from non-GAAP net income of $78.7 million or $0.36 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter and an increase of 7.6% from GAAP net income of $75.6 million or $0.35 per share in the prior year’s Q4. With that, let’s move to slide four. Here we’re looking at GAAP information. The operating performance on a GAAP basis showed some very similar trends to that that I have indicated. Our gross margins, opex and operating income all showed improvements from the December quarter. Operating income increased by $3.8 million from comparable measurements in the December period. During the March quarter, we completed the process related to a tax settlement. This settlement created benefit to the P&L during the March period of $52.2 million or $0.23 per diluted share. The closure of this matter has allowed us to take a fresh look at our effective tax rate on a go forward basis, and we are guiding to 20% effective tax rate for FY2008. GAAP net income for March was $127.7 million or $0.57 per diluted share inclusive of all shared-based compensation expenses and the effect of the tax settlement. The impact of earnings related to the adoption of share-based compensation in the March quarter was approximately 7.8%, which was in line with previous periods of this fiscal year. Moving to slide five, looking at on an annual basis, net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 2007 were record levels: $1,039.7 billion, an increase of 12% from sales of $927.9 million in the previous fiscal year. This marks the first fiscal year that Microchip has achieved more than $1 billion in net sales. GAAP net income for the fiscal year was a record $357 million, an increase of 47% from FY2006 or $1.26 per diluted share. Moving onto slide six and looking at the comparable performance of 2007 to FY2006, I would like to focus on non-GAAP results. Our record gross margins for FY2007 were 60.4%. This was an increase of 103bps over the results of FY2006. Opex was essentially unchanged as a percent of sales in FY2007 versus FY2006, with operating income for FY2007 of over $375 million, or 36.1% of sales. Net income for FY2007 on a GAAP basis was $325.6 million or $1.48 per diluted share. This represented an increase of over 19% YoverY. Moving onto geographic sales on slide seven: in the March quarter, Europe grew approximately 19% sequentially. Americas were essentially flat and Asia was down approximately 6% sequentially. The March quarter has traditionally been a very strong quarter for Europe and that followed that trend. Asian results are colored obviously by the Chinese lunar new year in that particular region. Asia represents approximately 40% of revenues and Europe approximately 33% of revenues and America is the balance at 27% as shown in the pie chart. This is all based on the quarter ended March 2007 ending data. Moving to slide eight, looking at cash balances, as at March 31st, Microchip’s cash and total investment position was approximately $1.3 billion with no debt on the balance sheet. During the quarter, Microchip generated net cash flow from the business of approximately $100 million prior to dividend payments. Payments related to our cash dividend of $0.265 was $57 million and we also reduced our short term borrowings by $29.5 million. In the fiscal year, we generated a record $470 million in cash flow prior to dividend payments for the year, which was $208 million. Looking at dividends on slide nine, the dividend declared today of $0.28 per share was an increase of approximately 5.7% sequentially and an increase of 30.2% over the same quarter in FY2006. Dividend payments in FY2007 as I indicated represented $208 million and the dividend payment that will be made in the June quarter based on the declared dividend will be at an annual run rate of approximately $240 million. Moving on to some of the balance sheet information on slide 10, initially looking at receivables, receivables increased by 3.7% or approximately $4.4 million during the March quarter. Collection performance was excellent during the quarter, particularly factoring in the geographical impacts of the lunar new year in Asia and the traditionally longer terms for our business in Europe. Receivable balances are in excellent shape with minimal amounts that are significantly beyond established payment terms. Moving to inventory information on slide 11, here measuring inventories without the effects of share-based compensation so that we still maintain a comparative basis. Inventory on our balance sheet declined by approximately $800,000 in the March quarter. It now represents 105 days of inventories, a decrease of three days from December. We are now in the middle of the range for inventories that have supported our business and we’re very comfortable with where we are. Our lead times continue to be short, with the majority of our products being available within three to five weeks. On slide 12, we are looking at inventories at our distributors, which continue to decline. It now represents 1.8 months of sell through, down from 1.9 months as at the end of the December quarter. This is the lowest level we have seen historically and relates to working capital management, not sales activity in the channel. Distributor sell through, in fact, increased by 5.7% QoverQ. When combined with the inventory on our balance sheet, the overall inventory in support of our business is near the lowest levels we have experienced for almost five years. On slide 13, depreciation expense for the March quarter is shown at $28.1 million versus $26.9 million for the same quarter last fiscal year and $29.1 million in the December quarter. Depreciation for FY2007 was approximately $114 million. Capital spending was approximately $9 million for the March quarter and approximately $60 million for the full fiscal year. Some level of projected FY2007 capital ended up being pushed into FY2008 due to the business conditions. Our capital expenditure forecast for FY2008 is now $80 million based on our outlook for this fiscal year. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $105 million for the fiscal year. I will now ask Ganesh and Steve to discuss the performance of our business, our guidance for the June quarter and update other business matters. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Gordon, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now comment on the individual product lines, after which Steve will walk you through our guidance for the next quarter. Please move to slide number 14. Starting with microcontrollers, our microcontroller business was up 4% sequentially and up 6.5% over the year-ago quarter. FY2007 microcontroller revenue hit an all time record at $834.2 million. Our flash microcontroller business was up 7% sequentially, achieving a new quarterly revenue record and was up 21.3% over the year ago quarter. Flash microcontrollers now represent over two thirds of our microcontroller business. Additionally we expect to ship our two billionth flash microcontroller later this quarter, and we believe this is – by a significant margin – the largest number of flash microcontrollers shipped by anyone. Looking at one of our leading indicators, we shipped 24,847 new development tools last quarter, which was another all-time record. The record shipment of development tools demonstrates continued strong design win activity and acceptance of our products. Let’s move to slide number 15. Earlier this month, Dataquest published their 2006 report for 8-bit microcontroller market share. Dataquest’s report confirms that Microchip became the number one supplier of 8-bit microcontrollers in dollar terms for the first time. You’ll recall that we had already achieved the number one position in units back in 2002. Moving to slide number 16, a little more color on the Dataquest information: according to Dataquest, in 2006 Microchip with a growth of 15% was the number one supplier, surpassing Freescale who declined by 12% and Renesas who grew by 4%. NEC, who held the number four position, declined by 12% and ST Micro who held the number five position grew by only 2%. Also for the Dataquest report, Microchip is now not only the number one 8-bit microcontroller supplier, but is also 22% larger than Freescale at the number two position. This results exemplify the strength of Microchip’s differentiated business model in producing sustained, industry-leading results. Moving to slide number 17, on 16-bit microcontrollers, our business is up 41% sequentially and up 135% over the year-ago quarter. Our 16-bit design win momentum and development tool sales remain very strong. The number of volume 16-bit customers grew to 735 in the March quarter from 638 in the December quarter. In terms of 16-bit customers of all volumes, that number is in the several thousands. We shipped 3,278 16-bit-specific development tools in the March quarter, bringing the total shipped to date to 23,427. We now have 92 16-bit microcontrollers in production. Moving to slide number 18, this slid compares the growth of our 16 bit revenue with the high end 8-bit microcontroller product line called PIC18. PIC18 has been a very successful product line for us and was introduced four years prior to the introduction of the 16-bit product line. The graph shows that the growth of 16-bit microcontrollers and revenue is equivalent to the growth of the high-end 8-bit, despite a very demanding comparison including longer design times associated with our 16-bit products. On slide number 19, we have the analog product performance. Analog products were down 3.3% sequentially, however FY2007 analog products revenue was 24% higher than FY2006 and hit an all-time record of $82.7 million. While the market for analog products has been challenging with the majority of competitors reporting significant sequential declines in the March quarter, we appear to have the best reported performance in analog among our competitors and we believe we’re continuing to gain market share. The number of customers buying our analog products grew to 12,147, from 11,687 in the previous quarter. On memory products, the net sales were down 0.7% sequentially. Our pricing declined moderately QoverQ. With that, let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments and our guidance for the June quarter. Please move to slide 20. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thanks, Ganesh. Today I would like to first reflect on the results of the March quarter. Then I will discuss the guidance for the June 2007 quarter. All of the figures in our comments will be prior to share-based compensation expense in order to do a fair comparison to the prior quarters. The figures with share-based compensation expense are all available in the press release. We beat our guidance for the quarter despite very challenging industry conditions and a broad-based inventory correction. Our sequential growth last quarter was higher than all of the semiconductor companies that have announced results so far and most companies have sequential declines. Our net sales were up 2.9% sequentially. We achieved another record gross margin of 60.5%, thus we demonstrated a peak to trough gross margin decline of only 17bps in the cycle and then we achieved another record gross margin just one quarter after the trough. We also achieved an operating profit of 36%. This quarter also marks the 66th consecutive quarter that we have been profitable, a testament to the resilience of Microchip’s business model over many business cycles. We shipped a record number of new development tools, indicating strong acceptance of our products and strong design win activity. The record shipment of development tools is also an indicator of the success of Microchip’s demand creation initiative. In the last several years, we have increasingly taken more direct control of demand creation. We have added Microchip direct resources as well as regional distributors, catalogue houses, design houses and manufacturers’ representatives. All in all, this retuning of demand creation has been very successful. As one evidence of the success of our demand creation program, is that our global distribution net sales were up 9.3% sequentially. It clearly shows that our demand creations efforts are being successful and the customers are then buying the products from global distributors. In addition, the relationship with Arrow is normalizing. The Dataquest report that Ganesh highlighted clearly shows the evidence that the difference in our performance versus the industry’s has widened, further validating our demand creation strategy. Another point I would like to note is that Microchip proved once again that the book to bill ratio of the prior quarter does not correlate to the revenue for the following quarter. In the December quarter, our book to bill ratio was 0.97 and some investors questioned our flat guidance while most competitors were guiding down significantly. We in fact achieved a growth of 2.9%, reaffirming that the book to bill ratio does not predict the next quarter’s revenue. Having said that, the book to bill ratio for the March quarter was 1.01. Move onto slide number 21 – now the guidance for the June 2007 quarter. As we looked at the June quarter, we took several factors into account. We looked at our own bookings and business activity in various product lines, our starting backlog for the June quarter was slightly higher than that for the March quarter. We also looked at the inventory situation. The inventory at our distributors hit another all-time low of 1.8 months. The historical range has been 1.9 months to 3.3 months. As we have talked before, we believe that the bulk of inventory correction was over in the December quarter and the rest of it completed in the March quarter. Our own inventory continues to be in very good shape. Our internal inventory ended at 105 days, down three days from last quarter and significantly lower than our guidance of 111 days. We also looked at lead times. Our lead times remain in the three to five weeks range with most products available off the shelf. Next slide please? The June quarter is also a seasonably strong quarter for Microchip, therefore taking all these factors into account, we expect our June quarter net sales to be up about 5% sequentially. Our internal inventory is right in the middle of our historical days of inventory and we are heading into another up cycle. Therefore we have started to increase the wafer starts in fab 4 in Gresham. We are also increasing production rates in our assembly and test facility in Thailand. We have also increased our capex forecast for FY2008 to $80 million from $60 million actual for FY2007. Non-GAAP gross margins for the June quarter should be up by about 25bps to about 60.75%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be about 25%. The effective tax rate is expected to be about 20%. Non-GAAP EPS are expected to be about $0.40. EPS with share-based compensation expense should be about $0.37. We expect to build approximately $110 million of net cash flow before payment of $61 million of dividends just announced today and we look forward to sharing this cash with investors with another increase in dividend in the next quarter. Let’s move onto our final slide, number 23. So in this I will summarize a few highlights of the business. We have achieved continued strong growth through market share gains in the 8-bit microcontrollers. Dataquest reported that we became number one in 8-bit market share in revenue in 2006. We have gained a traction in 16-bit microcontrollers, demonstrating strong sequential and YoverY growth. In our analog business, we outgrew all other major analog competitors with 24% growth in FY2007 over FY2006. In our gross margin performance, we demonstrated a mere 17bps peak to trough decline during the industry cycle. We have achieved record gross margins again and we have started the climb towards the long-term guidance of 62% gross margin. We have shown strong growth through our unique demand creation model. The revenue coming from our distributors has continued to increase, reflecting that our demand creation efforts are channel agnostic. We have boldly headed into another up cycle. Based on the results I have just summarized, we find ourselves uniquely positioned to continue to gain market share in all of our strategic product lines and outgrow the competition. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Operator: Operator instructions. We’ll go ahead and take our first question from Tore Svanberg, Piper Jaffray.
Tore Svanberg: My first question is on the channel inventories. You said they’re now at 1.8. The historical range is 1.9 to 3.2. Going forward, what do you think the new historical range will be?
Steve Sanghi: Our feeling is that distribution is continuously setting into a mode of higher returns on their own inventory, getting more cycles of inventory. I don’t think it’s ever going back to the high point of 3.3 before. Will it always stay 1.8 or could it go closer to 2 or even slightly higher? That is certainly possible but the whole average inventory distribution will carry and will be much lower on the average than ever before.
Tore Svanberg: My follow up question is can you comment a little bit about how business has been so far in the month of April?
Steve Sanghi: The business in the month of April has continued to be very good. Bookings are very strong. April should be up well over the prior quarter so there are really no issues.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski: With Europe being up 19% for you in the quarter, is that just seasonality or are you starting to see some of the effects from signing some regional distributors there in the last couple of years?
Steve Sanghi: It’s a combination of effects. Europe is seasonally a strong quarter. You know, the March quarter, because the March quarter tends to have no holidays. The other quarters have either Easter or Summer or Christmas or some other holidays. Seasonally it’s a strong quarter but the results in Europe are absolutely tremendous. They go far beyond really what the seasonality would imply. There are significant share gains resulting from our efforts in the channel, adding regional distributors and design houses. A lot of it is adding a large number of our own people who are creating demand. In fact, a bunch of that demand is getting satisfied through the global distributors. Albeit at a slightly lower margin - our global distributors were up 9.3% sequentially, significantly more than Microchip was up in total. The total global distribution issue that has been around for a while in the minds of investors and analysts should really be put to bed here.
Simona Jankowski: Just one more question on the manufacturing side. I think I had initially expected less upside in your gross margins while you were reducing your internal inventories, but it turns out your inventories came down more than you had expected while margin was up more than you expected and it seems like guidance is similar for the June quarter. I just wanted to get a sense of what turned out better than you had thought in the quarter?
Gordon Parnell: I think gross margins were fairly close to what we had guided. Many of the factors in our gross margin continue to be positive. We see depreciation as a percent of revenues continuing to help us to drive gross margin. We see favorable product mix from this current quarter with microcontrollers being a larger component of our business. As we look forward, those will continue to be factors and as we start to increase the activity levels in our business, both in wafer fab and in assembly and test, over time, as those costs begin to represent themselves in subsequent quarters, that will help us to continue to move towards the 62% goal. What was really very important for us was that these revenue levels that both inventory on our balance sheet and in distribution declined showing that we are very well balanced and very well positioned to be able to take advantage of the conditions in FY2008.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse.
Michael Masdea: When you talk about hitting the bottom and going into an upturn, one thing that you typically hope for is underlying demand growth is starting to accelerate, as opposed to just inventory ending. It seems to me maybe that’s more like the latter in this case. Let me know – are you seeing something different, or any sort of acceleration from an actual demand perspective rather than just a supply chain perspective?
Steve Sanghi: I don’t really know how to decipher it. We believe for our business, most of the inventory correction was over in the December quarter as we said before and we actually guided the March quarter to be flat and we actually beat that by 2.9%. The March quarter itself represented some of the growth from various initiatives we have had and new product lines, fixed in that and others under the demand creation efforts. Our June quarter is heading into another strong quarter, partially seasonally and partially continuing to be as a result of those efforts. I do not consider that June quarter guidance to be a bounce up from a depressed March quarter which had a substantial inventory correction. March quarter was actually up. If you compare our results from many of the others we have announced that the results for March quarter were down 7-8%, whatever those numbers were, and they were guiding significantly up for the June quarters. Those results would have the inflection coming from a depressed level to a bounce. Our numbers do not show that.
Michael Masdea: That makes sense. As a follow up, can you give us a sense of your growth you’re seeing right now? What percentage or what piece of it is really coming from what you think is market share gains and going into new markets versus underlying demand and to that end, what do we look for beyond 16-bit and analog. Is there other things we should start to think about for your future?
Steve Sanghi: Michael, we cannot separate the business that we won – whether that given design win that we won is a new demand or market share regained. It’s really one and the same thing. There are customers, new designs come up. Maybe in the prior model they were using somebody else – now they’re using us and that’s a gain of market share. Another guess is the product goes into a brand new application where maybe something else was used. It’s really, with 55,000-60,000 customers we have worldwide, that’s a very, very difficult question to answer. Therefore, our focus really is to continuously build feature-rich products and really market them with one of the best sales system in the industry that really creates demand and continuously focuses on winning every design out there. Sometimes that design is a brand new design. Other times – or most times – the designs are what were previously our competitors designs, so it’s a combination. The other thing you can do is look at how fast the underlying markets are growing. When you look at the underlying markets, how fast 8-bit is growing or 16-bit is growing, or analog is growing, those numbers are available to you from other industry sources and I think the markets have been relatively flat. You know, there is not a strong growth. That would really highlight that much of our success is coming from producing superior products and superior selling efforts and hence a large portion of that is really market share gain.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Danely - JP Morgan.
Chris Danely: Steve, can you give us a sense of what sort of time amount or revenue level it would take to get to your target gross margin? Do you have any target operating margins out there you want to throw out?
Gordon Parnell: Giving you a specific number is difficult. We still see in the next one to two years getting to the 62% range in terms of our guidance. This is on a non-GAAP basis just to make sure we’re speaking from the same currency perspective. As you go further out in time, many of the factors become more difficult to predict. Whether that is product mix or utilization factors or market conditions, we’re always continuing to look for ways where we can grow the business profitably and ensure we can continue to gain market share and drive our top line growth. There’s a complementary aspect to that, Chris, that we think is very important. We are still comfortable with the range over the next one to two years to get to the 62% level.
Chris Danely: The follow up is are you guys seeing anything new or more competitive from the competition, especially now that say Freescale has gone private and seems to be focusing on microcontrollers more?
Steve Sanghi: When is it that they weren’t focusing on microcontrollers! I think we heard that in several different reincarnations when they were rolled out and separated and private and public and back private now. I think you have to separate some facts from rumors and speculations here. Let’s take a look at some of the facts. The VP of Distribution they hired from Microchip a couple of years ago is no longer there. It’s also a fact that his replacement now reports at a lower level in the organization. It’s also a fact that Microchip’s demand creation model has been very successful. I have spoken about it quite a bit already. The rest are rumors and speculations. Why did he leave and what will they do with their program and will they focus on microcontrollers or not – we don’t really care. You’ve seen us over time. We focus our resources on our channel partners and our strategies. We’re several steps ahead, usually, and we focus on our own moves rather than the moves of the competition. I don’t really know what they might or might not do.
Operator: Our next question is from Gil Alexandria – Darfill Associates(?).
Gil Alexandria: Could you give us some color on your tax rate going down to 20% and will that tax rate hold beyond the next year?
Gordon Parnell: As we said in the conference call here and the press release, we have settled a number of years of tax audits related to the change in the $52 million, which is a favorable P&L perspective. Much of this is related to the complex nature of a tax structure of a company like Microchip. We are an international organization with many tax boundaries that we need to deal with and many taxing authorities that again we need to be responsive to. Certainly, as we look forward, provided there are no substantive changes from a tax basis in the main jurisdictions that we are in, we believe that 20% is sustainable.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Chris Caso - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.
Chris Caso: I wonder if you could talk a bit with respect to capacity? You talked a bit about the capex goals for this year. Where do you sit right now in terms of the Gresham utilization rate? Is that something you need to think about in the future in terms of doing some further capacity expansion as we’re looking into the potential upturn here?
Steve Sanghi: There are really no capacity issues short term or even slightly longer term. We have shown slides that we have an installed capacity of $1.4 billion between our two fabs. From the run rate we are running at today, that is substantial head room and we have, in addition, significant clean room space available in the Gresham fab to get another $300 million more than that. We have a capacity all the way up to $1.7 billion and a portion of our output is coming from foundries where we outsource production. Over the next few years, that gives us another couple of hundred million dollars of revenue. We think we have capacity to get to $2 billion, which is substantial headroom, before we have to worry about getting to any kind of capacity issues. Similarly, we have capacity in assembly and test. Now, you know, there’s an ongoing requirement of some equipment – certainly in assembly and test and some in fab – because when we brought the Gresham fab it was not a 100% equipment match to what we needed. As we ongoing increase our production, we have to add certain equipment as we go. That represents the $80 million forecast we have just given you. A portion of that is what we pushed out from FY2007 into FY2008 when the inventory correction hit at the end of the December quarter we basically pushed out several million dollars of capital into this quarter. So you can see that almost at a maintenance level capital of about $80 million or so, we have significant head room in capacity.
Chris Caso: As a follow up, I’m sure you guys saw what Linear Technology decided to do a week ago. There are some other companies in the space that seem to be having a different attitude towards capital structure and taking on debt with part of that being a buyback stock. Obviously you guys are clearly focused on the dividend, but taking a look at what someone like Linear decided to do, would that be something that you guys would entertain? Have you looked at any change to the capital structure such as that?
Steve Sanghi: You have to being with caring about the shareholders and being shareholder friendly. We have been told by investors and analysts over time that we have been one of the most shareholder-friendly semiconductor companies, largely through a very strong dividend program. We were the first ones to start paying significant dividends and we’re now really one of the highest dividend-paying companies in the industry. Your question really is whether we’ll go to the next step and buy a large portion of the company back, together with a convert transaction like Linear did. We are continuing to review such alternatives, but we really have not made any decisions yet.
Chris Caso: But you’d be open to a transaction if it made sense to you guys?
Steve Sanghi: We always look at all available alternatives. In general, we are not fans of financial engineering – we’d rather focus on product development and selling and growing our business. However, we constantly look at all available options for shareholder value and this is really no different.
Operator: Operator instructions. Next we’ll hear from Ian Eigenbrot(?) with Bank of America.
Sumit Dhanda: It’s Sumit Dhanda. Hi guys, congratulations on another solid quarter. I had a couple of questions, Steve or Ganesh, it seems like consistently your flash point controller business outpaces the rest of the 8-bit controller category. Now it’s two thirds of the business. As we are thinking about the long-term growth for the 8-bit category, this continues to be a bigger and bigger part of the mix. Do we really think about the overall growth rates for the category moving higher, or as the 8-bit flash controllers get more mainstream, the growth rate starts to taper off?
Ganesh Moorthy: If you’re talking about the 8-bit market overall, if you’ve noticed over the last several years, you know, that’s been a steady, relatively flat market. What has been growing inside the 8-bit market is the flash and programmable and reprogrammable portions of that market. The story behind our growth has been riding the programmable market share and then with flash the reprogrammable market share. We expect that there is still lots of growth left as more and more of the overall 8-bit market becomes programmable or reprogrammable in its nature.
Sumit Dhanda: I understand that, but my question was inherently it seems like the flash based markets are getting higher growth rates. Do you think that growth rate ultimately comes down or do you think your overall microcontroller category migrates to that higher growth rate which you have had in the flash category?
Steve Sanghi: Both. I think a year ago, the programmable market was about 40% of the total 8-bit microcontroller. I believe numbers this year are about 45% or so. As that flash market becomes a larger and larger portion of the overall market, definitely its growth rates will come down. At the same time, as that becomes a larger portion of Microchip’s business and growing at a faster rate, our growth rates will accelerate. I think the answer is yes to both of them. Somewhere in the middle.
Sumit Dhanda: The follow up I had was that Steve, you mentioned that the relationship with Arrow has ‘Normalized’. Can you just expand what you meant by that?
Steve Sanghi: I think I would look at the larger issue first. The entire worldwide Microchip sales and applications team really has one simple mission, that they execute on a daily basis. That mission is really drive design wins to revenue. We put that as a singular focus and we don’t really focus on the commercial aspect of where the customers want to buy the product. Whether the customer buys the product from Microchip, from a distributor, from the Microchip website or any other way, we think it’s completely in the hands of the customer. We don’t direct the business one way or the other. With a totally non-commissioned sales force, which is unique in our industry, there is no corporate or individual incentive to direct the placement of that business in any particular manner or to any particular channel. Globally, we are dedicated to winning designs and beyond that, we’re channel neutral in terms of where the customer wants to buy the product. Our distribution business five years ago was about 65% of our business. Now our distribution business is about 65% of the business. A lot of the stories and rumors you hear about Microchip is this and that about distribution is just not correct. All we are dong is taking more direct control of our demand creation and a large amount of that business continues to go through distribution because they’re in the field. They carry inventory. The customer can quickly buy the product. They provide additional services like (cladding and canban?) and programming and others. Despite the changes that we have made in the global distributors, our distribution business continues to grow and I mentioned earlier, our global distribution business was up sequentially quite a bit. Now coming down to your specific question, which is really about Arrow. With the resources that Microchip has added and the record demand that we are creating for our product, a lot of this demand is being served through Arrow. Business at Arrow is not falling off the log at all. Our business at Arrow is actually growing. In the March quarter we just completed and we are announcing today, our net sales through the Arrow channel were up 5.4% sequentially – more than the sequential growth of Microchip in total. Therefore the relationship itself with Arrow is normalizing. They’re benefiting, we’re benefiting and our demand creation efforts are really positive for both.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Louis Gerhardy – Morgan Stanley.
John Arne(?): This is John Arne calling in for Louis Gerhardy. Congratulations on a great quarter and congratulations on an equally good outlook. My question actually has to do with expectations for the next quarter. Do you have a turns booking target that you have to hit your goal?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. The turns target is just a calculation based on the guidance we gave you minus the backlog we started at. We do not have that number here but I did mention in my commentary that the starting backlog for the quarter was higher than it was for the March quarter, so it’s a calculation but we don’t have that number nor do we give it out.
Gordon Parnell: It’s more of a subjective element, certainly with distribution having a tremendous focus on working capital and we have seen inventory come down. Often the backlog and the revenue or the product shipped to distribution isn’t indicative of what the point of sale results of that would be also. We look at all those factors in terms of determining what our revenue guidance is and where we think inventories are going to settle on our balance sheet also?
John Arne(?): As a follow up to that, is there a historical turns bookings rate that you’ve had in the past? To give me a better indication?
Steve Sanghi: Over the business cycles the turns required have ranged between 25-75%. I know that doesn’t help you, and we have shown over and over when we used to give the turns required years ago that it does not correlate in our business. It absolutely does not. 90% of our business is proprietary products. The only person you’re competing with is yourself. The customer designed in your product, they can’t buy from anybody else. They’re going to buy from you or one of the channel partners. Therefore whether that business was booked on March 25 for deliver into May, or whether it was booked on April 5 for delivery in to May, it doesn’t really matter. So starting backlog, book to bill, those things have not been meaningful indicators in our business. If you had been a long-term Microchip investor, you would know that I have made that comment hundreds of times and I have shown many, many times, including the quarter we just completed, with a 0.97 book to bill ratio in December. We were up 3% sequentially. Now with a 0.97 book to bill ratio we have a substantially higher turns requirement for March than we had in the December quarter. Yet we beat the number. If we had given you that number in January, there would be a lot of concern. It simply raises volatility and raises concerns and the indicator is not valid.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Jeff Rosenberg - William Blair & Company.
Jeff Rosenberg: Just real quick, I wanted to ask could you tell us what your market share is in the 8-bit market according to Dataquest?
Steve Sanghi: I think Dataquest, the numbers that came out…
Ganesh Moorthy: It’s between 15-16% as measured by revenue. I think we can get you an exact number if you want?
Jeff Rosenberg: No, that’s helpful.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch.
Joseph Osha: Following on from the previous question, is there some point at which you think looking at the TAM that it becomes harder to gain share? 30%? 50%? When you think about this, is there any sort of theoretical limits as to how big you can get in this market?
Ganesh Moorthy: There probably is far out in time. At the moment, we see no real limitations to growth. At 15-16%, that’s 84-85% of the market that is still left for us. As we continue year after year, we find that we’re able to find that growth. I think a lot of that comes because the reprogrammable segment is growing a lot faster than the overall 8-bit market. That’s where we play the largest and that is the portion of 8-bit that’s growing the fastest.
Joseph Osha: So when you thought about it, you haven’t said ‘Okay once we hit 30%’ – obviously that’s a long way from now, but there isn’t sort of a number that you look at and say ‘All right, we can’t get past it’?
Steve Sanghi: In any competitive market with a number of players, it’s not unusual to see the largest player has a 30% plus market. Xilinx has it, Altera have it. TI has it in DSPs. You can look at a number of different markets for people in the DRAM or flash business. Market leader – if you looked last year at our growth versus the number two player, the difference was 27%. Our growth versus – our plus double digits and their negative double digits. With those kinds of market share gains, I think we can continue to grow. Is there a top number somewhere? It’s way out there that we don’t really worry about it right now. While we approach that number, we think our 16-bit product line and analog product line are rapidly coming where over time they become larger and sizeable where they pick up the slack.
Joseph Osha: Sure. That 35% number seems reasonable if you look at other markets. In the 16-bit market, is the competitive environment at all different? As I look at the competitors, it seems to be the same bunch of guys. Has it been different at all?
Ganesh Moorthy: I think it’s very much the same set of competitors. There are some who don’t play in 16-bit, they only play in 8-bit and then they are on to 32-bit. Many of them, if you look at the numbers – two, three, four on 8-bit, they are the same or in that same group of top 16-bit players.
Joseph Osha: Sounds great. Please don’t do a convert!
Operator: Next we’ll hear from Uchay Urji(?) – UBS.
Uchay Urji(?): Just for Steve, if I look at your exposures to the consumer market, at the moment it looks like the global growth is offsetting the weakness in the US. Do you potentially think this could be a problem in the future if the US consumer remains low?
Steve Sanghi: Our business is global. We sell in every country in the world where it’s legally allowed to sell. 75% of our business is outside the United States. With so much focus on the US consumer, it doesn’t really directly correlate to our business. Last quarter, 33% roughly of our business is in Europe so a third of our business is in Europe. A third of the business is in Europe, and while the US is about 25%, some of the business which is in Asia comes back to the US through multinationals and others. If you adjust for that, our best guess is our business is one third in Europe, a third in the US and a third in Asia. We participate everywhere. There is very strong growth in Europe going on right now. Germany and the UK and a lot of other countries are doing extremely well. All the sowing of China gloom and doom scenarios have not come true. Our business continues to do very well in all those geographies. People always talk about the US slowing down. I have heard of that forever and we seem to be more than making up for it to other geographies as well as superior market share gains.
Gordon Parnell: It’s also the content story. It’s true in our consumer products, just as it is in other markets. Just the number of microcontroller opportunities and white goods, small appliances, audio, video, other key markets that we look to continue to also give us a much more positive view of those rather than looking at GDP factors.
Uchay Urji(?): Just another question, if I look at your opex sales, it seems to indicate your opex keeps growing marginally faster than revenue. I assume that’s because of your investment in your direct sales force? At what point does that stabilize and when should we start to expect to see some type of leverage on the opex line?
Steve Sanghi: I don’t think that assessment is correct, unless you’re looking at non-GAAP to GAAP.
Gordon Parnell: Or longer-term perhaps.
Steve Sanghi: Number one, if you just look at the GAAP numbers, they have option expensing. If you look at the numbers a year or two years ago, they were not. It will show that expenses have increased. If you look at non-GAAP to non-GAAP, the long-term guidance we have been giving for a long time is 24-25%. We are seeing longer term in our model – we said it is 25%. We leave some headroom, 50bps to the average. If you need some investments or something it could be closer to 25. Sometimes it could be closer to 24. Last quarter was 24.52, non-GAAP, right in the middle.
Gordon Parnell: We will continue to invest in new products and a design creation model. It’s critical for our business that we deploy those to get the results on the top line that are important.
Steve Sanghi: I think for the entire period of three or four years, we have been making investments in sales and applications to tune up our demand creation model. I do not believe that it has happened at the expense of higher operating expenses.
Uchay Urji(?): If I look at your outstanding buyback, you say there are 1.5 million shares to be bought back that are left in the program. In terms of the choice you make between dividend and buyback, what’s right in those choices then? Should we expect that this program could be renewed or increased? This business keeps generating a lot of cash and well done on that anyway.
Steve Sanghi: Our choice between dividend and stock buyback is unquestionably dividend and has been for a long time. We have stated many time before that the only time we like a significant buyback is when the market throws out the baby with the bathwater, where the story is not understood and we think the stock price is unreasonably depressed because of some concerns in the market which we have not been able to rectify. The last opportunity we had like that was in 2003 during the SARS crisis in Asia. Since then, we have really not bought stock. Since we announced this large buyback a couple of quarters ago, we have not bought a single share.
Gordon Parnell: Just to clarify what is available, we had a 2.5 million share buyback authorized back in 2004 and there is about 1.5 million of that still available. Then in October of 2006, there was an additional 10 million share buyback. Effectively we have 11.5 million shares available to us in terms of the buyback.
Operator: We have a follow up question from Chris Danely with JP Morgan.
Chris Danely: Steve, I think you mentioned earlier that you expected a couple of hundred million bucks of outsourced products in three or four years? Is that true, and can you give us a sense of how much of your products are going through foundry now?
Steve Sanghi: Right now I think the foundry business is about 3.5% of our revenue roughly. We have said over five years it could be 10% of our revenue.
Chris Danely: That still holds true?
Steve Sanghi: What do you mean does it still hold true?
Chris Danely: So according to that it’s a couple of hundred million bucks – that’s the way you got to that number?
Steve Sanghi: Don’t walk me into a forecast! These are bilateral extrapolations. We are developing some products at foundries, we have some business plans where it needs unique processes which we do not have inside and there are reasons to develop them outside rather than spend the money inside. You know – there are a lot of different reasons. Whether it goes to 8, 10 or 12 five years out, you know, don’t pin me down on that.
Chris Danely: Last question – as we look at the rest of the year, how do you expect relative growth rates between E-Squared versus analog versus microcontrollers?
Steve Sanghi: That’s tough to call. Do you have anything?
Ganesh Moorthy: I think for microcontrollers overall, I think analog will be the fastest growing of the three lines. The 16-bit portion of our microcontrollers will be obviously growing even faster than analog, but overall microcontrollers are probably a little lower than what analog is. On E-Squared, we are really not trying to drive growth in it as much as to have it as a complementary product line and it will grow as a natural part of us growing the microcontroller analog products.
Operator: At this time we appear to have no further questions coming in, gentlemen. Is there anything further you wanted to add?
Steve Sanghi: No, we just want to thank everyone for participating and we’ll see you at a conference soon.
Operator: That does conclude our conference. Thank you all for your participation. We hope you enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2007 Q2  (2006-10-26 15:45:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the Microchip Technology Second Quarter and Fiscal Year 2007 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Gordon Parnell, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Gordon Parnell: Thank you so much. Good afternoon and welcome to our Second Quarter 2007 Conference Call. During the course of this call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, and our 8-K current reports that we have filed with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President. I will comment on our second quarter performance reviewing geographic data and discussing balance sheet and cash information, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, outline our guidance for the December quarter, and update other pertinent matters regarding our business. We will then all be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Our net sales for September quarter were at record levels of $267.9 million up approximately 2% from net sales of $262.6 million in the immediately preceding quarter and up approximately 17.9% from net sales of $227.3 million in the prior year's second quarter. On our earnings per share, we are continuing to include additional information in our press release that relates to the adoption of FAS 123R. Our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of the adoption of this accounting standard providing comparability to prior GAAP results. Our non-GAAP net income for the September quarter was at record levels of $84.2 million or $0.38 per diluted share, an increase of 3.4% from non-GAAP income -- from non-GAAP net income of $81.4 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter and an increase of 28.2% from GAAP net income of $65.7 million or $0.31 per share in the prior year's second quarter. GAAP net income for the September quarter was $79.5 million or $0.36 per diluted share inclusive of all share-based compensation expenses. The impact on earnings related to the adoption of share-based compensation in the September quarter was 6%. Our sales in Asia grew by approximately 4.5% sequentially in the September period while both Americas and Europe were essentially flat. In the summer quarter while we got the performance in Europe as being seasonally strong, Asia continues to be our largest geography representing approximately 45% of total sales. Americas and Europe were both at approximately 27.5% of total sales. This measurement is based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes for our customers, but doesn't represent where the design activity initially took place. Take a look at operating P&L information; initially our gross margins, they continue to improve reaching 60.45% in the September quarter. For comparative purposes in operating expenses, this is prior to the effects of share-based compensation; operating expenses were 24% of sales in the September quarter, essentially the same as they were at the previous quarter. Research and Development costs were $26.5 million, representing 9.9% of sales, and sales and general administrative expenses were 37.9 million, representing 14.1% of sales. Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis including the effects of share-based compensation were 26.4%. The tax rate for the September quarter was in line with our guidance of 24% and we expect that to continue for the rest of this fiscal year. The dividend declared today of $0.25 per share was an increase of approximately 6.4% sequentially and an increase of 56.3% over the same quarter in fiscal 2006. The dividend payment that will be made in the December quarter will be approximately $54 million. Let's turn our attention now to the balance sheet, and initially Microchip's inventory, excluding the impact of FAS 123R, inventories were essentially flat in dollars at $114.4 million representing approximately 99 days, a decline of two days from the June quarter. Including the adoption of share-based compensation, inventories were $117.6 million or 101 days of inventory. Distribution inventory continued to be at very moderate levels in all geographies. As of the end of September, our distributors held about 1.9 months of inventory down from two months at the end of June. Combining inventories on our balance sheet and other distributors, they would represent 134 days of total inventory, the lowest total inventory that we have seen in the last five years. Microchip's receivables at September 30 were $123.2 million, lower than the levels at the end of June by $14 million. Payment performance by our customers continued to be strong, delinquency in payments were minimal. The principal reason for the decline in receivables related to distributor inventory reductions that I mentioned earlier. On our cash position at September 30, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1.3 billion with $80.8 million of short-term debt on the balance sheet. During the quarter, Microchip generated net cash flow from the business of $128.5 million. Payments related to our cash dividend of $0.235 or $50.5 million and we also reduced our short-term borrowings by $56.5 million. We anticipate continuing to pay down the short-term borrowings over the next two quarters. Capital spending for September was approximately $17 million for the September quarter. Depreciation expense for the September quarter was 29.2 million versus 27.6 million for the same quarter last fiscal year, and 289.1 million in the June quarter. Our capital expenditure forecast for fiscal 2000 is now $70 million and previously it was $80 million and our depreciation forecast is expected to be approximately 150 million for the full fiscal year. With that I'll ask Steve and Ganesh to discuss the performance of the business, our guidance for the September quarter, and update other business markets. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Gordon and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to make a brief comment reflecting on the results of the September quarter and then pass it on to Ganesh Moorthy who was promoted today to Microchip's Executive Vice President. Ganesh will comment on the product lines and then I will discuss the guidance for the December 2006 quarter. All of the figures in our comments will be prior to share-based compensation expense in order to do a fair comparison to prior quarters. The figures with share-based compensation expense are all available in the press release. We delivered another record quarter in every respect despite very challenging industry conditions in the late quarter military led coup in Thailand. The political situation in Thailand is calm and there are no lingering effects from the coup. We achieved record net sales, record gross margin percentage, record operating profit percentage, record after-tax profit, and also record earnings per share. We also achieved record sales in each of our strategic product lines 16-bit microcontrollers, 8-bit microcontrollers, Flash microcontrollers and analog products. Now I shall pass it on to Ganesh Moorthy for some extended comments on the individual product lines. Congratulations, Ganesh, on your promotion.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Steve and good afternoon everybody. Let me now comment on the individual product lines. Starting with microcontrollers, our microcontroller business grew by 1.6% sequentially and was up 19.3% over the year ago quarter. Our Flash micro Controller business was even stronger and grew by 6.7% sequentially and was up 42.3% over the year ago quarter. Flash microcontrollers now represent over 64% of our microcontroller business. We shipped 16, 275 new development tools last quarter demonstrating continued, strong design win activity. 16-bit microcontrollers our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 53% sequentially in the September quarter and up 210% over the year ago quarter. The growth of our 16-bit microcontroller business continues to be similar to that of our high end 8-bit microcontroller architecture called PIC18 at a similar stage of its market ramp. After 2.5 years since the start of production, we believe 16-bit microcontrollers have reached the tipping point, with a large number of designs reaching production stage. The number of high volume customers grew to 484 in the September quarter, from 349 in the June quarter, an increase of 39%. And in terms of 16-bit customers of all volumes, that number is in the thousands. We now have 78 16-bit microcontrollers in production and four more that are sampling. Based on the momentum we see, we expect 16-bit microcontrollers to be up another 15% to 25% sequentially in the December quarter. Moving to analog products our analog business was up 2.2% sequentially and up 43% over the year ago quarter. The market for analog products has been tough with a majority of competitors guiding to a sequentially down quarter in December. We believe that we are continuing to gain market share in analog. The number of customers buying our analog products grew from 11,546 -- sorry, to 11,546 from 11,369, in the previous quarter; a growth of 177 customers. And on our Serial E-Squared memory business, this was up by 5% sequentially. Business rebounded from the weak conditions of the last several quarters and we continue to focus on serving our strategic customers, whenever we can attach Serial E-Squared products to a microcontroller or analog product. Pricing in this segment remained essentially flat, quarter-over-quarter. Let me now pass it back to Steve, for some comments on our guidance for the December quarter. Steve?
Steve Sanghi: Thanks Ganesh. Before I discuss our guidance for December 2006 quarter, I would like to make one important comparison. This comparison is important before our largest competitor, Freescale Semiconductor leaves the public marketplace, emerging as a private company. Freescale reported that their September quarter sales of TSPG segment where microcontrollers are housed were down 2% sequentially. Microchip's microcontroller sales were up 1.6% sequentially. On an annual basis, Freescale's TSPG sales were up 7%, while Microchip's microcontroller sales were up 19% over a year ago quarter. A substantial difference, so despite the significant questions, we keep hearing regarding Freescale, we're continuing to gain substantial market share. Now the guidance for the December 2006 quarter. As we look at the December quarter, we took several factors into account. We looked at our own bookings and business activity in various product lines. Our book-to-bill ratio was 0.94 and the starting backlog for December Quarter for direct customers, as well as distributors was lower, than that of September quarter. We also looked at the inventory situation. The inventory at our distributors continues to be at the lowest level of our historical range. The historical range has been 1.9 months to 3.3 months. Current distribution inventory is 1.9 months. Our own inventory is lower than the middle of our historical range. The historical range has been 74 to 134 days. The inventory is currently at 99 days lower than the middle point and has been dropping for several quarters. We also looked at lead times. Our lead times remain in the 3 to 5 week range which is the shortest amounts to competitors. Looking at it geographically, we expected this to be a strong quarter for Asia, but we are continuing to see softer build activities. We are engaged with all of our customers, but the run rates in general are lower than expected. In the other two geographies of Americas and Europe, this is a seasonally weak quarter due to Christmas holidays. Taking all these factors into account, we expect net sales in the December quarter to be down approximately 5% sequentially. Looking at the current market conditions, we have lowered our capital expenditure forecast for the fiscal year from, $80 million before to $70 million now. Gross margin for December quarter are expected to be about 60.25%. I'd remind investors that our long-term growth margin guidance continues to be 62%; however, we're seeing a temporary pause in the growth of gross margin due to market conditions. Earnings per share are expected to be about $0.36. This is prior to the share based compensation. Earnings per share with share based compensation expense should be about $0.33. We expect to build approximately $100 million of net cash flow before payment of $54 million of dividend just announced today. And we look forward to sharing this cash within investors with another increasing dividend in the next quarter. So, let me summarize a few key points. Our net sales are expected to be down approximately 5% sequentially and now without the equity compensation expense, our gross margins are expected to be about 60.25%, operating expenses to be about 24.5% to 24.75% of sales, and earnings per share are expected to be about $0.36. With that [Talarie] will you please poll for questions?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Adam Parker with Sanford Bernstein.
Adam Parker: Yeah, hi, guys. Just trying to understand some of the data you're giving us. I mean do you think that the guidance here in terms of being particularly weak is just a function of all demand or do you think there is demand in weakness or do you think there is maybe some of your inventory at your distributors, customers? Or can you help us at all with why they kind of look at it and say maybe this is the second worst December in the history of the company, is it all just macro or --
Steve Sanghi: Well, Adam some of the conditions in the industry are similar to what was experienced in 2004. But it doesn't look as bad as it was 2004. The book-to-bill ratio was better the general environment just does not look as bad. Looking at the other companies guidance, everything doesn't look as bad as 2004. So I'm sure there is some component of inventory. The distributor inventory itself does not affect our sales, because we do not take that as revenue but if distributors' customers have some inventory, that's really hard to get at when you have 50,000 customers and a majority of them being served by distribution. As far as our own customers are concerned which are really the direct customers we serve, that's approximately were 38% of our business roughly?
Gordon Parnell: 35%-36%.
Steve Sanghi: Yeah, so in that range, 36% of our business. Those customers, we don't really see any signs of major inventory correction. We just see the run rates to be lower as everybody seems to be cautious just given the market conditions, GDP, and all of the other data and all of the talk, so everybody is just cautious.
Adam Parker: So, it's just a weakening economy of yours about that, I guess.
Steve Sanghi: I'm sure there is some built-in inventory correction in there at some customers here and there, but it's really not broad-based. It doesn't look to be all inventory correction.
Adam Parker: Okay, the follow-up that I have or the second question I have is you guys made some comments, you made some changes I guess in your distribution network and I was trying to understand if you're feeling that there was too much order fulfillment and not enough incremental revenue generation, can you just talk a little bit about what your strategy there is and how it's evolved and why it's good for you guys going forward?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we have been tweaking our demand creation for a better part of about 40 years now through several layers of changes. In one, we added some dedicated production win reps which only carry Microchip product line and do not carry any other competitor product line. We added a layer of regional distributors in various territories in the world, and regional distributors again do not carry any competitive lines. We made changes to the global network where our experience was that the global network, I would say with the exception of future electronics, was really not creating any demand for us and was largely really all fulfillment, so we adjusted the compensation scheme. So we were paying appropriately only for the demand fulfillment, and with several years into these changes, it's quite clear that we made the right call there and despite lot of (inaudible) on all sides and our sales are growing faster than our competitors. I gave you comparison to Freescale, our funnel is full with demand creation, our 16-bit microcontrollers sales are exploding and went up 53% sequentially, albeit from a small base, and basically, we were seeing that the global distribution network, again with the exception of future, wasn't really creating any demand on 16-bit. We didn't win a single design from them, so we took control of it ourselves, added a lot of direct people, added some reps, regional distributors, and some other things, and the results are very obvious. Our analog business was up 42% over a year ago, or 43, and so all of the strategic product lines are growing, Flash microcontrollers are growing. So in answer to your question, I think that data is here. We made the right call.
Adam Parker: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: And we'll move next to Michael Masdea with Credit Suisse First Boston.
Michael Masdea: Yeah, thanks a lot. I guess I just have another follow-up on the (inaudible) comment. It seems a little bit surprising that these all-time lows and that they are going to further reduce in the fourth quarter, is it the case that there's something that allows them to get even lower than we've seen before or do you think they're pushing too far?
Steve Sanghi: Well, really aren't sure. If you listen to the Arrow's call this morning, they reduced inventories by $200 million quarter-over-quarter, Michael. They took their inventories down by about 12% on their balance sheet, and while they were a little bit more reticent in indicating exactly where they are going forward, they said that lead times were supporting them in their goal of getting tons versus earns basis in their model, and so we've seen that really across the board in many of our distributors as they continue to exercise better control of their capital as lead times continue to be short, and that's just part of the phenomenon that we have to deal with. Now having said all of that, with the type of reductions that our was an instance here did in their inventory, their sales were flat. So obviously the reduction in inventory isn't a reflection of the business conditions that they're seeing directly, much more related to how they intend to manage their business. We can't influence that. Unfortunately, we're not a POP supplier. We're much more focused on creating demand or fulfillment through some of our global distributors to the benefit of Microchip.
Michael Masdea: Okay. That makes some sense. One just follow-up and the second question, which is on the microcontroller side. With such explosive growth in the 16-bit strong growth in Flash, help us out with what was going on with the remaining segment, where the relative weakness at least came from?
Steve Sanghi: Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy: In the September quarter. I think we broke down, so we have growth in the analog business. The analog business.
Steve Sanghi: He is talking micro.
Michael Masdea: Within micro, it is just -- is at the 8-bit and what parts of the 8-bit were relatively weak?
Gordon Parnell: We don't usually break that out. We provide the microcontroller data in its totality, and we put 8 and 16 bits combined there. We break out the 16 in terms of the growth rate, but not the rest of the pieces.
Michael Masdea: Was there -- maybe not in terms of numbers, but was there any segment or is it all just the push off from Asian build where you saw the weakness, the relative weakness rather than just giving us numbers, can you give us a little color?
Gordon Parnell: We have such a broad-based business with so many customers, so many applications and segments, there's not really one piece I can point to which was the sole or primary cause for where we ended.
Ganesh Moorthy: No, if you look at geographically, trying to add to that answer, our European business was very strong last quarter. European Business in summer is always down because of the European holidays, but our business was flat, so that was seasonally good. The majority of the weakness came out of Asia. U.S. was okay, was slightly weak, but the biggest weakness came out of Asia and when we made a press release back in the middle of September, we totally saw that we were seeing a push out and slowdown of the Asian build related to Christmas. Asia business should have been up quite significantly than it was. It was up 4.5%. It was strongest geography, but that was a geography that missed the most regarding what they should have done.
Michael Masdea: Okay, thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: And next we have Romit Shaw with Lehman Brothers.
Romit Shaw: Thanks, given your plans to reduce CapEx by a little more than 10%, is it fair to assume that you guys expect this softness in build activity to potentially spill into next year or is the visibility at this point too low?
Ganesh Moorthy: Well, the CapEx is simply -- we needed to spend the capital in the current quarter and the next quarter to grow to another record sales, basically that's what drives CapEx. We needed to buy some fab-equipment, assembly and test method equipment to get to another record level of sales. With sales down 5%, you don't have to get to another record level and then it will take whatever time it would take to get back to the record sales, so it's a push out of the capital that we would have needed in the next three-six months, which we do not need anymore because sales are lower the record, which means we have largely the equipment in place already and there's always some capital need here and there for some small issues, but there is no incremental capital needed because we do not have to jump the high bar. This is that simple.
Gordon Parnell: And long-term design visibility continues to be strong, so we're very confident in the longer term direction of the business with new products that we've brought to bear. Certainly, the short-term backlog visibility is what we're speaking to as we move into December, but that doesn't give us any concerns as to the future direction over strategic products.
Romit Shaw: Just on OpEx, Steve do you think you have leverage with OpEx, meaning if the current conditions persist, can you bring down SG&A as a percentage of sales?
Steve Sanghi: Well, even in our current guidance, there's a substantial -- you have the numbers Gordon.
Gordon Parnell: Yeah, theirs is obviously at the levels that we've projected, there is a substantial reduction in operating expenses.
Romit Shaw: In absolute dollars?
Gordon Parnell: In absolute dollars, but not in percentage terms and we'll continue to exercise areas where we believe using those elements at our discretion in our business to further the business model, but the backdrop of that also Romit is we have 36 % operating margins, and we're driving this business not entirely for next quarter, but also for the future. So we have to be selective when we make those decisions because we don't want to find ourselves not being able to effectively promote and market our products for future revenue opportunities.
Steve Sanghi: The entire reduction in OpEx from September quarter to December quarter is driven by the variable compensation bonuses and just general tightening of discretionary spending and stuff like that. There is no reduction in headcount, not needed with just extremely profitable. In fact we are continuing to make investments in our 16-bit microcontrollers and our sales force and other strategic areas, they are continuing to be open acquisitions in the company to build for the long term future. We think it's a one quarter problem. If you look at this seems to be similar to 2004, we were down in December quarter 2004 and we came right back up and we grew in the March quarter and grew substantially in the June quarter and this doesn't even look that bad as it was in 2004. So for now, we think internally that this would be a one quarter problem again, because this quarter being down 5%, it sets up an easy comparison for the March which is historically a weak quarter, but then this quarter isn't strong then it makes it easier. So there is really no long term reduction needed in expenses of our R&D expenses last quarter were 9.9% of sales that's about half of the many other technology companies spend. So we're already the most profitable in terms of return on R&D dollars. And we want to keep spending that wisely.
Romit Shaw: Okay. Just one final question on stock compensation expenses. And maybe my numbers are incorrect, but it looks like the stock comp expense increases by a significant percentage this quarter. Any color, Gordon on why?
Gordon Parnell: Absolutely. We've talked about this before. Manufacturing expense starts to flow through inventory into the P&L. That's the absolute reason for it, so there's some timing involved with share based compensation for through inventories into the P&L. So the change is always like primarily driven by that. The reduction in revenues makes some increase in terms of the percentage also, but it's in line with what we said initially of between 7% and 8% when fully deployed.
Romit Shaw: Thank you.
Gordon Parnell: You're welcome.
Operator: And we'll move on to Craig Ellis with Citigroup.
Craig Ellis: Thanks, good afternoon guys. Starting with the clarification on the gross margin line, with the guidance in the calendar fourth quarter, down about 20 basis points, is that a utilization dynamic that's at play or is that more of a mixed dynamic, as we think about the 16-bit business growing and some of the other businesses say the 8-bit and the analog business declining sequentially?
Steve Sanghi: It is pretty much coming out of utilization dynamics. I mean, of the 20 basis points if you just look at the percentage it is up, 60.5%. It's just a very, very small number I mean we are just -- just a minor tweak and the guidance always is plus/minus 20 basis points or 20 basis points difference is really truly very, very small. We have reduced the manufacturing build in the back-end largely because for guiding down them how many units we're going to need and it's just purely a utilization dynamics driven from that. We don't expect much mixed change at all. We expect a healthy increase of 16-bit microcontroller which is positive. Analog should do well and that's positive, and then leaves the 8-bit micro and memory, you know which wherever they will come.
Craig Ellis: Okay, Steve. And then as we think about just uses of cash in the past, the company has been pretty (inaudible) about maintaining a dividend and now you've got the stock buyback plan. Can you just share the thinking on with why you went with the stock buyback plan now and how should we think about your appetite for using that buyback plan?
Steve Sanghi: Definitely. That's a good question. We continue to be committed to dividends and continuously increasing dividends over time. The stock buyback, we have announced today is just basically a measure as we have said before that we only buy stock when we believe, that the street has thrown the baby with the bathwater and that -- you know, last time that happened was in 2003, right after Warren (inaudible) when stock was 17 and people were calling it 12 and it went to 30 within six months. So those are the kind of occasions when we like to buy the stock, when there is a high level of misunderstanding about the company's opportunities. And a single down quarter somehow drives into a downdraft. It did not happen in 2004 and we cannot call it, we cannot predict it, how market will react at this time. So, it's a safety net in place to be ready to buy a large amount of stock. We have money available to invest and we're telling you now in this conference call that the company continues to do extremely well, on all of it's metrics in terms of design wins and new products and gross margins and everything and this is a temporary phenomena driven by the market conditions we're seeing. And I think after street having seen the results of many of the other semiconductor companies who have reported similarly, we hope that the results will be understood. But if there's any misunderstanding, the buyback gives us a safety net.
Craig Ellis: Okay that's a clear message, Steve and one last question for Gordon. Just a clarification on the balance sheet. Deferred income to distribution was down about $13 million sequentially. As I look for precedent in my model, I think the most significant percentage decline since 2001, on a dollar basis, goes back further than that. Is that what you expect going into the quarter and anything that's surprising as you look at that line?
Gordon Parnell: I think it's a little lower than we would have expected, going into the quarter. I think that some of the -- I mentioned our own and other distributors are following similar patterns where they're looking to hold lower levels of inventory and they are supported by the fact that our lead times are continuing to be very short. 90% of our products are available in three to five weeks. They obviously see some level of uncertainty in their business, plus they are trying to improve their working capital management overall. So it's definitely the lowest levels we have ever seen. Today, we expect that to be flat to down, just based on the feedback we're getting, not that that is directly an indication of business conditions, but I think it's directly related to how distributors are managing their business in the current environment.
Craig Ellis: Okay, thanks, guys.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And we'll move to Mark Edelstone with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Edelstone: Good afternoon, guys.
Steve Sanghi: Hi.
Ganesh Moorthy: Hello Mark.
Mark Edelstone: Hey Steve, are you seeing any difference in terms of the order patterns between analog and say the 8-bit controller business, specifically in Asia?
Steve Sanghi: We're not. Very similar, you know we are engaged with all of the 8-bit customers. We're engaged with all of the analog customers and many times the customers are the same. You know where they are essentially buying a kit and both parts go in then and then the run-rates are lower. You know, run rates across-the-board would be seeing bookings and the run-rates are pointing to a lower number than we experienced in the September quarter.
Mark Edelstone: Okay, great.
Steve Sanghi: No customers are going away. Seem to be no loss of market share anywhere. No larger designs going away, not a single major design loss or a major customer loss. It doesn't seem to be just one thing. It's just everybody is less confident about their business.
Mark Edelstone: And then you talked about tightening up things on the backend. Are you also slowing wafer starts at this stage?
Steve Sanghi: We tend to not make wafer start changes, as quickly unless we see a longer term phenomenon and the reason being to run at the so high yield and so consistency that we run at. The training required in the front-end is much, much laborious. So we don't really tend to move the wafer starts. We just allow usually, we did this again in 2004 also. We just allow the inventory to grow up a little bit and when the sales grow in the next quarter and two, the inventory comes back down and you've seen that a number of times. So no we have not changed wafer starts.
Gordon Parnell: The entry days getting to maybe only 106 at the end of this quarter, Mark, we're still in very good shape. Long life products, no obsolescence issues in our business, that's all and so we're in very good shape from that perspective.
Steve Sanghi: A high point at the end of the 2004 cycle was somewhere in the 118-120 days, somewhere in there. So when we are doing extremely well. We manage inventory extremely well in this up cycle. We kept lowering inventory quarter after quarter for the last five, six quarters almost, and at that time, we could have actually ramped Fab harder with a slightly higher gross margin. We decided to keep the inventory low because in the next cycle we did not want to have to take the Fab down and which is what's happening right now. So we're running the Fab at the same cycle as we ran last quarter.
Mark Edelstone: Right. Now, you're in great shape and I guess what I was trying to figure out is unless we get a big snap back in the March quarter, it sounds like we should probably expect to see another slight uptake in days inventory in the March quarter before maybe starting to head back down again in June?
Ganesh Moorthy: Our internal analysis for the March quarter, obviously I can't give you the guidance here, but the inventory was actually comes down slightly.
Steve Sanghi: And obviously it depends on what the demand environment is.
Ganesh Moorthy: And make revenue assumption, but our inventory actually comes back down little bit from the high watermark we set in this quarter.
Mark Edelstone: Okay, thanks a lot guys.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy: Welcome.
Operator: And we'll move to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski: Hi, thank you. Just a quick modeling question first on your guidance of $0.33 for next quarter. Can you just expand on it, is that's based on a flat share count or should we assume a declining share count behind that guidance just as a starting basis point?
Steve Sanghi: Well, a lot of that is going to be based on what the stock price is over the next 90 days and so we're waiting in there, but we would expect it to be plus or minus half a million shares probably.
Simona Jankowski: Okay. So that didn't include any of that benefit basically if there was a benefit from the buyback?
Gordon Parnell: Didn’t include a large stock buyback.
Steve Sanghi: No, it did not.
Simona Jankowski: Okay. And then the other question, and I'm not sure if you'll be able to really comment on this or not, but it was interesting earlier today on arrow's call, they commented on having a book-to-bill, which was between 1 and 1.1 across their end markets and in particular, commented on reasonably decent demand by their small-to-mid sized customers, and this is something that is definitely not consistent with what most of the other analog components suppliers are saying, so just curious if you guys are in any position to maybe comment on why they are seeing a stronger pattern than yourself and others that you compete with?
Steve Sanghi: I think that that book-to-bill ratio is very encouraging for our sales and for other suppliers generally speaking. Certainly, our book-to-bill ratio is colored by their inventory holding pattern. We look at our book-to-bill ratio for our distributor business versus our direct business. Our direct business was higher than the 0.94 reflecting the fact that they are absolutely taking inventory out of the channel and out of their business, so we see that as a positive indication. They said that their small-to-medium customers really have limited inventory and they see no issues from that, but obviously they did indicate that their larger customers, it's more difficult to see where that's going. So overall, we're quite encouraged, it's sort of confirmed our feeling relatively in the marketplace that this is not a long-term phenomenon that this is really fairly short-term in nature.
Simona Jankowski: Sure, and I guess maybe just to reconcile, so the percentage of your business that is actually direct, the reason that that book-to-bill was not necessarily above one is because those tend to be larger customers. That's why they're direct. Is that the kind of correlation to that?
Steve Sanghi: That's true. The larger customers in general tend to be direct and larger customers have larger volumes, so when they have any kind of reduction, they're more meaningful. If you look at the smaller customers Simona, we have grown our customer base from about 50,000 customers we have recorded in the past to 55,000 customers that we have really calculated very recently. If you look at our analog customers that grew by 177, if you look at our 16-bit customers, they are now in thousands and even the volume 16-bit customers were up 38%. So if you count all of the smaller new customers we're adding, that book-to-bill can easily be positive, but see, we don't take bookings from those small customers. Our distributors take bookings from the small customers so that number could be extremely positive for us too. That's why all of the strategic product lines with small volumes, new customers are all growing.
Simona Jankowski: Okay. So we can really think of that as a somewhat leading indicator for you guys?
Gordon Parnell: I would think so, but the conclusion with Arrow with their book-to-bill ratio that they quoted is they still guided diving on their components business to be flat to minus four. So even with a book-to-bill ratio, that was not the one, the phenomenon of fewer workdays or ship days or other elements are obviously reflected on their overall business also.
Steve Sanghi: It also means the impact of larger customer is larger than even the smaller customers having positive book-to-bill.
Simona Jankowski: Great. Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: Next we have Chris Danely with JP Morgan.
Chris Danely: Thanks, guys. Quick question on gross margins. If we just assume that March quarter revenue is flat or flat to slightly up, does that mean your gross margins would probably be flat or down or up in that environment?
Steve Sanghi: If March quarter is flat, our gross margin probably would be flat to maybe even slightly up.
Chris Danely: Got it. And then Steve, can you just talk about the transition to Ganesh? I mean, can we expect you to completely phase yourself out over the next year and why now? Anything else?
Steve Sanghi: Oh. There's really no, you know, as the press release said, there's really no change in the direct responsibilities that Ganesh has in terms of his managing advanced with microcontroller business, all of the 16-bit microcontroller business, digital signal processor business, you know, any future architecture with developing, he has the automotive business. He also manages the Microchip Thailand plant. So he has substantial responsibility but in the global marketplace today, him and I both travel like crazy, so we have set a system where when I'm traveling, none of the activity has to essentially go on hold because if he's here and if he's traveling and I'm here, so he will just help me in broader functions of the company like strategic planning, our annual operating plans, our quarterly reviews, our monthly reviews and internally and externally and all that, but there is no timetable for me phasing out. I'm only 51 years old. Don't push me out yet!
Gordon Parnell: Chris many of the investors have met Ganesh and when we've gone to conferences and you can expect to see him a little more visible there. Again, helping, he shares a lot with Steve when Steve's traveling, visiting customers or other business activities.
Chris Danely: Okay thanks, guys.
Operator: Next we have Chris Caso with Friedman Billings and Ramsey.
Chris Caso: Yes, thanks. I wonder if you could just clarify some of the earlier comments, I'll let you know what I heard and correct me if I'm wrong. It sounds like that majority of the weakness that you saw coming into the quarter was related to the seasonal businesses that are based in Asia. I guess if you comment a little bit on the daily run rates that I guess you have seen and are seeing in the U.S. and European markets which I guess are a little more tuned to the industrial markets, have those held up or are those daily run rates down also?
Steve Sanghi: Europe is doing very good. What would you say for Americas? I would say slightly weaker.
Gordon Parnell: Slightly weaker, sure, than our expectations.
Steve Sanghi: Europe is doing extremely well. Either we just got a bit of product traction or the general, our regional distribution network in Europe has always been significantly stronger. There are really no regional distributors left in the U.S. They have all been covered by Arrow or Avnet. So in the last several years, we have built the demand creation engine in U.S. And is doing extremely well in Future Electronics is do being extremely well for us. But when you go to Europe, in each of these countries, the biggest distributor in every country we have in Europe is usually one or two regional distributors so that's very, very mature network and over the last several years, they have responded extremely well to our new products, 16-bit analog and others because they never had any competitive line for those products. So we are doing actually extremely well in Europe. Last quarter was really pleasing and the European economies are doing relatively better than U.S and other economies. Asia was the weakness.
Chris Caso: Okay. Well and I guess if you just remind us kind of typical seasonality is as you go into the March quarter? And I guess typically you have more selling days in the U.S and Europe and typically that picks up and Asia turns down. Is that correct assessment?
Steve Sanghi: Yes. I think in many years what we see is Asia has a couple of weeks off during the Chinese New Year, so driven by that, you do less number of days. Asia is usually flattish. It can be down too but it's usually down to flattish. It has an overall growth but because of loss of number of days, it really -- the general growth makes up for the number of days lost. Europe does very well and U.S. Does okay, so we have a good chance of really being up here in the March quarter.
Chris Caso: Okay. And I guess the swing factor there, we will you be watching would be those daily run rates in U.S. and Europe, I guess. For revenue to actually be up in the March quarter then?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, and the daily run rates also in Asia. I mean, Asia has still 43% of the business.
Gordon Parnell: Yeah, right.
Chris Caso: But you would still, typically expect that to be down in the March quarter in a typical year though?
Steve Sanghi: Well the daily run rates are not down. They just have less number of days.
Chris Caso: I see.
Steve Sanghi: If you want the daily run rates to grow and if there's any softness now, we expect that to recover I mean the economy is starting to get positive. The consumer confidence is starting to get positive. Lot of the other consumer numbers came out, were pretty good. So oil prices have come down, so whatever is driving the current weakness, it's already on the way to mending and hopefully, by next quarter we see that the consumer is back on the mend and we want the daily run rates including Asia to be up but then there are less number of days.
Gordon Parnell: Asia comes back from Chinese New Year and generally speaking, the rate of activities in the factories compensates for the fact that they've been off for five or six or seven days. And that's being the pattern that we've seen and that leads into June and September which are obviously traditionally our strongest periods.
Chris Caso: Okay, great. That’s great color. Thank you.
Operator: And next we have [Uday Joshi] with UBS.
Uday Joshi: Hello. Thanks for taking my question. Can you quantify for us the impacts of the Thai Coup, if there was any -- but are you able to make up the lost business during that period and if some of that spilled into the December quarter guidance?
Steve Sanghi: In the Thailand coup we basically were impacted for a portion of just one day.
Uday Joshi: Okay.
Steve Sanghi: The day the coup happened, all the government offices were closed and public transportation system was closed and the airport was closed down and so that was really the only day and you know, if it happened in the middle of a quarter, there will be absolutely no issue. If it happened about ten days or so before the end of the quarter, so it created a flurry of activity and out of -- there was another issue where Thailand changed their airport in Bangkok. They shut down the airport on exactly 29th of September and opened a new airport they have been building for awhile and whoever scheduled that airport start on the 29th of September should be shot. But somebody had a key result to make for the quarter, (inaudible). So there was some flurry of activity there. Altogether, I don't think we lost much. I think we made up most of it but there was some impact in a few hundred thousand dollars, not really very meaningful.
Uday Joshi: And just one last question. Thanks for that by the way, just one last question on the December quarter guidance. Revenues were down 5%, gross margin is kind of flattish and yet the EPS is going to be flat. How do we think about how you're going to flex OpEx and would that be a new run rate to use if you think about the March quarter?
Ganesh Moorthy: No, EPS is down from $0.38 to $0.36 on a non-GAAP basis and it's down a further penny on a GAAP basis, so…
Steve Sanghi: Just look at GAAP to GAAP and non-GAAP to non-GAAP. It's really the FAS 123 really confuses it. The numbers we just announced were $0.38 without the effect of equity compensation and that $0.38 comes down to $0.36.
Uday Joshi: Right.
Steve Sanghi: The GAAP numbers were $0.36 and they come down to $0.33.
Uday Joshi: Okay, that's clear. Just let me just get back on one point. If I look at your June quarter, if I had to look at gross margin on a GAAP basis, also are you able to quantify that for me just so that I can have a clear idea of what the impact is and have a good comparison for June and September and into December?
Steve Sanghi: June quarter was 60.36%
Gordon Parnell: Correct.
Uday Joshi: And this includes this on a GAAP basis?
Gordon Parnell: On non-GAAP.
Uday Joshi: On non-GAAP, on a GAAP basis do you have that?
Gordon Parnell: They were the same. There was no impact of share based compensation in the June quarter, because it wasn't flowing through from the inventory into the P&L. The First Quarter that's going to occur is in the December quarter.
Uday Joshi: Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much.
Gordon Parnell: You're welcome.
Operator: Next we have Tore Svanberg with Piper Jaffray.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, good afternoon. First of all, Steve, you said there's a good chance maybe business bounces back in March. Is that more predicated on what you saw a couple years ago or are you actually also hearing from your customers that this will be a very temporary slowdown?
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know, I'm just reading the tea leaves. What I hear, what I see, you know, the customers are still relatively positive about their business prospects, the new designs we're winning, the economy seemed to be on the mend, when you read the reports from other large consumer giants and the system companies and what they're saying. There's a lot of money going back into consumers pocket to a significant decrease in interest rate. I'm sorry, increase in oil prices and gas prices and stuff like that. So I'm just building a view from that. I don't have bookings to reflect that. That’s just in this environment you don't really get a tremendous amount of bookings for the next quarter year.
Tore Svanberg: Great, thanks. And also, Gordon, maybe I can ask the inventory question little differently. You said combined with the channel the level is 144 days -- 134 days. And that's quite long historically. At what level would maybe the supply chain get nervous? Are we talking about this level or could it go down further?
Gordon Parnell: Well, you know, I think that (inaudible) from the distributors are they feel that they can take it down modestly lower, but I'm not sure that we have the insight to know what their end goals are here, Tore. Certainly our lead times continue to be short. We are well placed to be able to deliver. Part of the concern we have is then, are we really getting brokered to an extent and again, one of the factors that the distributors earn their margin on is based on inventory holding, as well as receivables and design creation and other factors. So it's at a stage where I wouldn't expect to see substantially -- substantial reduction in those channel inventories, but I suspect if you'd ask me that question when it was at 2 or 2.1 months, I might have probably answered the same way. So the right guys to ask are Arrow and Avnet and see if you can get some commentary out of them.
Tore Svanberg: Fair enough. Finally, is your analog gross margin still running ahead of your corporate average?
Steve Sanghi: We don't break the gross margin for product lines for comparative reasons.
Tore Svanberg: Okay thanks again.
Operator: Next we have Sumit Dhanda with Banc of America.
Sumit Dhanda: Hi, just one question. Steve, when you actually lowered guidance for the September quarter, just a little before the quarter closed. My recollection was that your analog business was tracking towards the high end of expectations. Did it see a very sharp slowdown right at the end of the quarter? Though it happened and has that been the area where the slowdown has been the most dominant early through this quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know, I do not think that when we change the guidance for the quarter, we had modeled that new guidance across the product lines to break them out by-product line. You may recall, the coup had happened the night before. And not knowing the impact it would have on our manufacturing plant on a business. And not having fully modeled what the impact of Asia and all that might be, we were going to a conference and we were going to get a ton of questions. And we were -- it was actually your conference?
Sumit Dhanda: Exactly.
Steve Sanghi: Right, yes and we were in the air as the press release had been drafted. So we had not modeled the impact of that reduced guidance which was from 4% to 2% across the product lines. And I don't think we implied anything different. If we did, we had not modeled that completely.
Sumit Dhanda: Okay, because my recollection was that, you had indicated that 16 and analog was tracking behind of expectations. Okay, all right thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi: 16 definitely yes. Analog we do not imply that I think.
Gordon Parnell: I think the volumes in analog are such that it's getting to be somewhat of a more mature business. We certainly didn't have the visibility to imply that. If we said that unintentionally certainly, that was not what we were intending to do.
Sumit Dhanda: Okay thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: And we have time for one more question and that's from Jeff Rosenberg with William Blair & Company.
Jeff Rosenberg: Hi thanks. I guess my question is I may have missed it, but did you give the breakout of percentage of sales of microcontrollers, analog and memory for the quarter?
Steve Sanghi: We did not. We gave the growth, for the last quarters' numbers, but we can also give you the percentage.
Gordon Parnell: Sure. Just hold on one second.
Jeff Rosenberg: While you're looking, I'll ask you qualitative question. On the 16-bit, when you look at the volume customers, is that still heavily weighted towards the dsPIC product lines? Or do you start to see some of the newer product lines from a year ago, begin to enter volume productions -- I mean, getting designs going into production?
Steve Sanghi: The volume of customers obviously is still predominantly from the dsPIC30, but we definitely have the PIC24 and the dsPIC33 starting to ramp in volume as well, but in terms of number of customers, it's still dominated by (inaudible). We have long design cycles if you remember. It takes 24 months to design in, so on average and we have some that are faster but for the most part, today's volume of customers are primarily in the dsPIC30.
Jeff Rosenberg: So, when you look at the dsPIC30 and where it's been successful, I mean do you feel like it's weighted in one action towards niche-type DSP type applications, like motor control and things like that or is it more towards areas where it's the more robust just microcontroller capabilities are really what drives success? I mean, is there a waiting towards where you see the products been the most successful?
Steve Sanghi: Well the dsPIC30 is really is a 16-bit microcontroller with a DSP engine on it. So its core applications are primarily micro Controller applications that need higher computational power and it goes into a very, very broad set of applications. So yeah, motor control certainly is one of those applications, but there are many, many others as well that gets designed into.
Jeff Rosenberg: Okay. And I guess --
Gordon Parnell: On the revenue split, Jeff, so for September, microcontrollers are 80.1%. That's down modestly. It was 80.5% in the prior quarter. Memory is about 12% that was 11.7%, in the prior period and analog is about level at about 7.9%.
Jeff Rosenberg: Okay, thanks.
Gordon Parnell: You're welcome.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer-session. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Sanghi for any final or additional remarks.
Steve Sanghi: Okay thank you very much for joining our conference call and we'll see you on the road at some of the conferences coming up. Otherwise we'll talk to you on the next Conference Call. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude our conference call. We do thank you for your participation.

===== 2007 Q1  (2006-07-21 15:45:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology Q1 and fiscal year 2007 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer Mr. Gordon Parnell, please go ahead.
Gordon Parnell: Thank you and welcome everybody to our Q1 2007 Conference Call. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our 10K for the fiscal year ended March 31st 2006 and our 8-K current reports that we have filed with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO and Ganesh Moorthy Vice President, Advanced Microcontroller and Memory division. I will comment on our Q1 performance, reviewing geographic data and discussing balance sheet and cash information, and Steve will then give his comments on the results, outline our guidance for the September quarter, and update other pertinent matters regarding our business. We'll then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Let’s begin with net sales, our net sales for the June quarter were at record levels of $262.6 million up approximately 6.2% from net sales of $247.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter and up approximately 20.2% from net sales of $218.5 million in the prior year’s Q1. In our earnings per share this is the first period that Microchip has adopted FAS 123R. We have included additional information in our press release and will continue to furnish additional data to assist investors during this transition period. Non-GAAP income excludes the affect of the adoption of this accounting standard providing comparability to prior GAAP results. Our non-GAAP net income for the June quarter was at record levels of $81.4 million or $0.37 per diluted share, an increase of 7.7% from GAAP net income of $75.6 million or $0.35 per diluted share from the immediately preceding quarter, and an increase of 33.4% from GAAP net income of $61 million or $0.29 per share from the prior year’s first quarter. GAAP net income for the June quarter was $77 million or $0.35 per diluted share inclusive of all share based compensation expenses. In fact net income in this period exceeded the March reported levels of $75.6 million, establishing record levels inclusive of the share based compensation costs. The impact on the earnings related to the adoption of share based compensation in the June quarter was 5.6%. Looking ahead after the full effects of this adoption is reflected on our results we expect that the impact will be approximately 78% on net income. Clearly the impact from share base compensation for Microchip is in the lowest quarter for a technology company based on the results reported from our peers. Geographically, sales grew in all territories, sales in Asia grew by approximately 11%, Europe grew by about 3.8%, and the Americas grew by approximately 1.8%. Asia continues to be our largest geography representing approximately 44% of total sales while Americas and Europe were both at approximately 28%. This measurement is based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes for our customer's but doesn't represent where the design activity has taken place. Looking at some of the operating parameters of our business, our gross margins continue to improve reaching 60.36% in the June quarter. Our longer term gross margin target that we have indicated to the street continues to be 52%, this being prior to the affects of share base compensation. Looking at the operating expenses for comparative purposes I’m using operating prior to the affects of share based compensation. Operating expenses were 24% of sales in the June quarter compared to operating expenses of 23.9% in the previous quarter. Research and development costs were $25.7 million, representing 9.8% of sales, sales and general administrative expenses were $37.3 million representing 14.2% of sales. Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis after the effects of share based compensation were 28.2%. our tax rate for the June quarter was in line with our guidance of 24% and we also declared a dividend today of $0.23-½ per share and this was an increase of approximately 9.3% sequentially and an increase of 88% over the same quarter in fiscal 2006. The dividend payments we made in the September quarter will be approximately $50.5 million. Let’s turn our attention to the balance sheet, initially looking at our inventory. In this balance sheet category we have a change in inventory levels related to the adoption of share base compensation and we’re measuring against last quarter on a comparable basis when inventories were $150 million and $160 million. Our June end inventories were essentially flat at $114.9 million representing 101 days of inventory, a decline of five days. Including the adoption of share based compensation inventories were $116.6 million or 102 days of inventory. Our distribution inventory continues to be at very moderate levels in all geographies. As of the end of June our distributors held about two months of inventory and this has been essentially flat over the last six months. Given the concerns from investors we have had related to growing inventory levels on company’s balance sheets and in channel inventories, our overall reductions in inventory levels reflects not only the strength of our business performance but the manner in which we are managing our inventory levels. During September we anticipate that inventories will continue to decline on our balance sheet reaching approximately 95 days, a further reduction six days from levels exiting the June period. We expect distributor inventories to remain essentially flat in the September quarter. Taking a look our receivables at June 30th, they were $137.2 million, this was lower than the levels at the end of March by about $2.1 million with improved shipment linearity in the period and strong collection performance which offset the net sales growth in the period of 6.2%, this area of our working capital contributed to the record cash flows that we experienced in the period. In our cash position as of June 30th, Microchip’s cash and total investment position was approximately $1.2 billion, with $137.5 million of short term debt on the balance sheet. This is related to the repatriation of $500 million under the American Jobs Creation Act that we discussed in our March Earnings Call. During the quarter Microchip generated net cash flow from the business of $136.5 million, establishing record cash generation levels for our business. Payments related to our cash dividend of $21.5, was approximately $46.1 million, and we also reduced our short-term borrowings by $131.5 million from the $269 million reported at the end of March. This reduction was predicated on both the new cash generation in our offshore locations as well as the maturity of investment positions in those locations during the quarter. We anticipate being down to short-term borrowings over the next three quarters. In capital spending and depreciation our capital spending in the June period was approximately $16 million, depreciation expense for the June quarter was $28 million versus $27.8 million for the same quarter last fiscal year and $26.9 million in the March quarter. We are maintaining our capital expenditure forecast of $80 million and the depreciation forecast of approximately $115 million for fiscal 2007. With that I’ll ask Steve to discuss the performance of our business, our guidance for September quarter and update of the business matters. Steve.
Steve Sanghi: Thanks you Gordon and good afternoon everyone. Today I would like to reflect on the results of the June quarter, comment on the product line, update you on our distribution strategy and finally discuss the guidance for the September 2006 quarter. All of the figures in my comments will be prior to share base compensation expense in order to do a fair comparison to prior quarters. The figures with share base compensation expense are all available in the press release. I’m extremely proud of our continuing excellent execution in delivering yet another record quarter in every respect. Microchip has passed an extremely important milestone with net sales of record $262.6 million; Microchip for the first time is above a $1 billion run rate. This also concludes a year long internal program at Microchip called April Touchdown 2006, the primary goal of Touchdown 2006 was to drive Microchip pass the $1 billion mark. Net sales also exceeded the high end of our prior guidance. Our gross margin of 60.36% was also a record and was up 26 basis points sequentially, our operating profit was another record 36.4%, earnings per share was $0.37 and set another all time record, and we also generated a record free cash flow of $136.5 million in the June quarter. So now I shall talk about the product line, first, Microcontrollers. Microcontroller business grew a very robust 8.2% sequentially and was up 21% over a year ago quarter. Our Flash Microcontroller business was even stronger and grew by 12.2% sequentially and up over 46% over a year ago quarter. Flash Microcontrollers now represent over 60% of our Microcontroller business. Another interesting fact is that OTP Microcontrollers which is a majority of our non Flash Microcontroller business was also up 2.6% sequentially and it was down only 4.5% over a year ago quarter. We stopped the development of OTP based Microcontrollers more than four year ago, and moved all of our development to Flash based Microcontrollers. The resiliency of OTP based Microcontrollers revenue reveals the long product lifecycle of our product that we often talk about. The bulk of our growth in Flash Microcontrollers is incremental business gaining market share over competitors and not from converting our own business to Flash. We shipped another record $20,921 development tools last quarter, we are continuing to experience strong design activity with our 8-bit as well as 16-bit Flash Microcontrollers and we are seeing a significant number of new applications emerging which are utilizing our products. We are very well positioned to continue to gain marker share. Now 16-bit Microcontrollers. Our 16-bit Microcontroller business was up 10% sequentially in June quarter and up 85% over a year ago quarter. The growth of our 16-bit Microcontroller business continues to be similar to that of high-end 8-bit Microcontroller architecture PIC-18 at a similar stage of market ramp. The number of customers grew to 349 in the June quarter from 324 in the March quarter; we shipped 2,951 new development tools last quarter versus 1,284 shipped in the March quarter, an increase of 129% sequentially in development tool sales. This represents significant momentum in the acceptance of our 16-bit products and architecture; there are now 15,622 cumulative development tools shipped and supporting our 16-bit products. In terms of total number of products, we now have 65 16-bit Microcontrollers in production, 10 more are sampling and these 10 will be in production by the end of this quarter. I would like to point out one more fact on our 16 bit Microcontrollers. We had significantly larger backlogs for the quarter than the 10% sequential growth that we achieved. However we suffered from significant product mix issues. We largely build the product on a forecast of product mix; many of the 16-bit products are very new and have less history again the established 8-bit products. Therefore we left an additional 15% sequential growth on 16-bit microcontrollers in the back log. The starting back log for September quarter on 16-bit microcontrollers in quite strong, the book the build ration for our 16-bit microcontrollers was a whopping 1.5 last quarter. Therefore we see a very strong growth ahead based on the momentum with the customers we see, we expected that our 16-bit microcontrollers to be up another 25% to 35% sequentially in the September quarter. Serial E-Squared memory products. Serial E-Squared memory products net sales was down 2.3% sequentially, we are continuing to see memory business as weak, we are focusing on serving our strategic customers wherever we can attach Serial E-Squared to a microcontroller or analog product. Pricing remained essentially flat quarter over quarter. Analog Products. Analog products were up only 1% sequentially and up 48% over a year ago quarter, several customers took a pause last quarter yesterday after a torrid phase of growth for the last several quarters. The design momentum on analog products continuous to be strong and we do not see any fundamental shift in our value proposition. The number of customers buying our analog products grew to 11,369 from 10,808 in the previous quarter, a growth of 561 customers in the quarter. We see continuing growth ahead and expect a growth of about 4% to 8% sequentially in the analog products in the September quarter. So summarizing the product lines, the last quarter performance that reveal the strength of growth on our 8-bit microcontrollers. We have been guiding investors for some time now that the 8-bit microcontroller market continuous to convert to field programmable. Microchip is a leader and be see that this market is headed into the direction of our strength. With small growth an analog last quarter, negative growth in memories and mix issues that we suffered in the 16-bit, the dollar growth for the last quarter was provided primarily by our 8-bit microcontrollers. 8-bit microcontrollers let us to beat the high end of our estimate, the 8-bit business was very, very strong and we see continued growth ahead in that segment. Distribution Strategy. In the last quarter I updated the investors on our distribution strategy where Microchip defines our distribution network as global or regional distributors. Regional distributor the mainly in Asia and Europe and they usually do not carry competing lines. These regional distributors have significant dedicated technical resources applied to creating demands specifically for Microchip. Last quarter we added several new regional distributors and catalog houses in various parts of Europe. We will continue to add to this part of the channel in Europe and Asia. The second kind of distributor in our network is a global distributor. These distributors have hundreds of product lines and carry most if not all of our competitors’ products. Therefore, the focus and effort of these distributors is highly diluted and their sales and technical resources are pulled in too many different directions. Microchip has not seen these distributors being very effective in truly creating demand. On the other hand these global distributors are very efficient in fulfilling demand once a customer has designed in a product. So over the last three years Microchip has steadily taken more and more control of its demand creation by adding a significant number of technical sales and application engineering resources. This strategy has worked extremely well, our continued to success in 8-bit microcontrollers, a very strong growth in 16-bit microcontrollers, as well as analogue is essentially vindicating this strategy. We also have a very special relationship with Future Electronics, our largest distribution partner in the world. Future Electronics is of course a global distributor, but in fact they actually act more like regional. In microcontrollers they do not carry some of our competitors, Atmel, Texas Instruments and Renesas, and in analogue they so not carry four of our Microchip biggest competitors. They do not carry Maxim, Linear analogue devices and TI. So Future Electronics have committed a large number of resources to create demand for Microchip’s products. This is highlighted by the fact that they will have a very large number of their field application engineers attending Microchip’s 10th Annual Masters Event this month for comprehensive training on our products. And now I shall discuss our guidance for the September 2006 quarter. First of all, we are continuing to see positive signs in our business and we believe that the sky is not falling on the semiconductor industry. As we look at the September quarter, we took several factors in to account. We looked at our own booking and business activity in various product lines which continues to be good, our book to build ratio was 1.01 and the starting direct backlog for September quarter was higher than that of the June quarter. We also looked at the inventory situation. The inventory at our distributors continues to be at the lower end of the historical range. The historical range has been 1.9 months to 3.3 months, current distribution inventories two months. Our own inventories in the middle of our historical range, the historical range has been 74 to 134 days, the inventories currently at 101 days right in the middle and has been dropping for several quarters. We also looked at lead time. Despite strong bookings our lead times remain in the three to five weeks range which is the shortest among our competitors. We also note the global issues of oil prices increases and conflict in the Middle East. By the way Israel is less than 1% of our business. So taking all of these factors into account, we decided to keep our guidance conservative and we expect net sales in the September quarter to be up about 4% sequentially. With a decreasing inventory at Microchip and a forecast for continued growth, we are preparing our factories with equipment and personnel to execute the needed RAM, we are well-positioned from here to the end of December 2006, and we are evaluating equipment needs from January 2007 on, and some of that has to be ordered fairly soon based on the lead time. Our CapEx forecast for the fiscal year assumes this and our CapEx forecast stays at about $18 million. Gross margin for September quarter are expected to be about 60.6%. I remind investors that our long-term gross margin guidance is 62% and we are steadily making progress towards that goal. Earnings per share are expected to be about $0.39, this earnings per share is without the share-based compensation expense. EPS with share-based compensation expense should be about $0.37. We expect to build approximately $125 million of net cash flow before payment of $50.5 million of dividends just announced today, and we look forward to sharing this cash with investors with another healthy increase in dividends in the next quarter. Finally, I want to thank those investors and analysts who have taken the time to read my book titled ‘Driving Excellence,’ which was released three months ago, all the comments that I have received so far are very positive. I hope that all long-term investors and analysts will get a chance to read the book. It gets you inside Microchip to look at how the aggregate system of Microchip was built and implemented. It reveals the culture of Microchip Technology, which we believe is behind the exceptional performance of Microchip for so many years. So let me summarize a few key points. Our net sales are expected to be up about 4% sequentially and now without the equity compensation expense, our gross margins are expected to be about 60.6%. Operating expenses to be about 24% of sales, operating profit to be about 36.6% and earnings per share are expected to be about $0.39. With that operator, would you please call for questions? Operator?
Operator: Thank you.  [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Michael Masdea from Credit Suisse.
Muhammed Siraj: Hi, this is Mohammed Siraj calling in for Michael Masdea. Could you discuss if you have seen any change in customer mentality especially looking in the June month or even first couple of weeks of July?
Steve Sanghi: We have not seen any change in customer mentality. Our July bookings month to date, are actually very strong so we are continuing the strength of bookings we have seen into June, and continuing into July.
Muhammed Siraj: Got it. And maybe a follow up question, could you discuss; why are you bringing in lead times, I guess especially in this environment? What was the driving force behind the light shortening in lead-time this quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Our lead times never went out. We have substantial manufacturing capacity, because of large amount of capacity available in our FAS4, so to this entire cycle of lead times basically it has been three to five weeks, so the lead times are not coming in they never went out.
Muhammed Siraj: Never went out, okay, got it. And then just the final question. Looking more long-term, are you seeing any activity in the 32-bit microcontroller market, and if so is this is an area you see Microchip having interest in? And if so, when do you think you would see more activity in that area?
Steve Sanghi: Our dsPIC products, our 16-bit products, in many cases have significantly higher performance than some other prevailing 32-bit microcontroller architecture. For example, our tPIC24 architecture and the dsPIC architecture have 50% higher performance in mid-speed compared to 7. So Microchip today is winning significant designs into the marketplace, which without for Microchip, would have gone into a 32-bit architecture. So we believe we already have a very, very competitive solution to many of the 32-bit products in the marketplace with our dsPIC and PIC24 architecture.
Muhammed Siraj: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: We will take our next question from Tore Svanberg from Piper Jaffray.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, good afternoon. Can you talk a little bit about your bookings trends? You mentioned July had started quite strongly. How about the linearity in the actual June quarter?
Steve Sanghi: Gordon…?
Gordon Parnell: You know, I think booking trends you know, we operate a 4/4/5 model in terms of our monsoon bookings performed pretty much in line with that. There was nothing exceptional in any of the ones that would take -- that would have any issue with linearity. And that obviously helps to project on to our revenues being linear as I mentioned during my comment.
Tore Svanberg Piper Jaffray: Okay and you mentioned the mix issues in the 16-bit business that will lead to some pretty strong growth here in the September quarter. Can you just add a little more color on that, please?
Gordon Parnell: You know, we have 65 products in production today and you know, we only started about a little more than two years ago shipping products into that 16-bit, so many of the products are quite new although we have some sense into where the demand will come from because of the design wind pipeline. You know, however -- all these products are very compatible, they all work on the same architecture, they use same C-compiler, the pin-out is very compatible, so customers during their design very often move around and change their design from one product to another product looking for slightly different features or slightly lower cost or whatever. So we usually build the product to a mix of forecasts, which really comes bottoms-up from the sales with three to five weeks’ lead-time. You know, you are largely keeping those lead times because you usually get the mix right, we always get the mix right usually, but on brand new products where you do not have a lot of history and with a small size of the business, customers can relatively come in a different product then you have thought. So we suffered from mixed issues. A lot of that have already been shipped into July and some of that will be shipped into the balance of the quarter. If we did not have those mix issues, we would have achieved about 25% sequential growth on 16-bit microcontrollers last quarter and we brought it up to investors’ attention so you see the real design in momentum in growth and opportunity in our 16-bit business and see it at 25% level for the last quarter rather than 10%. The mixed issues have largely been addressed. There are lot of additional new products coming into production this quarter, so there is always a risk, but I think we are over killing it this time and should not suffer from the similar issues again.
Tore Svanberg: Great. And then just finally, those seemed like you expect slightly lower terms this quarter than last. Is that because of the summer months or is it just pure conservatism?
Steve Sanghi: Where do you get that?
Tore Svanberg: Just thinking about your backlog being up and your bookings already being strong and with 4% growth it just feels or sounds like you did expect summers to be a little bit less this quarter, I could be wrong.
Gordon Parnell: You know the prior quarter the book to bill ratio was 107 and 101 here and so you know, it turns us somewhere in that same range, give or take.
Tore Svanberg: Okay, that’s all, thank you very much.
Operator: Next we will hear from Chris Caso, Friedman Billings Ramsey.
Chris Caso: Thanks. Just as a follow up to that question, you made a comment that you took a bit of a conservative view towards the September quarter guidance in light of the macro condition. Could you kind of explain a bit; if you are expecting a similar amount of terms for the next quarter you know, how are you being conservative with the guidance? Could you just clarify it in a little bit, and then in terms of your customers either by their words or their actions, are they giving you any reason to be conservative other than you know, just we all reading in the papers everyday?
Steve Sanghi: We are getting no such guidance from our customers or our distributors. We are just being conservative because there are a lot of you know, macro kind of talk we are hearing and a lot of response we are getting from investors and analysts and response to other company’s numbers and just general talk, we believe the investment community is determined to cause a problem even if there isn’t one, at least we don’t see any problem in our business.
Chris Caso: Okay. So is that to mean then when you are providing guidance you did assumed the full level of bookings when you provided your guidance or are you assuming less terms? Just clarify …?
Steve Sanghi: We internally ruled out better than what we guided, but we were conservative.
Chris Caso: Okay, that’s fair. And then just with regard to the positive that you guys talked about n the analog space, could you give us some insight as to you know, why you’d see that in the analog space and why not in the microcontroller? Is that a function of different end markets between your analog businesses and your microcontroller businesses?
Steve Sanghi: The analog business was up 48% over a year ago. The quarter before it was up like 52% over a year ago, it was up about 16% or 17% sequentially. I am just recalling some of these numbers, so many time you have any business going on at such a torrid pace, you can always have few customers get ahead and they take a pause, so it’s really driven by that. Our microcontroller business is growing very steadily, was up sequentially 8.2%, 21% over a year ago quarter so we didn’t really see any pause in the microcontroller business driven by that. Also, microcontroller business is much large you know, it’s a huge business with nearly 50,000 customers, so they’re much, much diversified than the analog businesses today.
Chris Caso: Okay, fine. And just one final one, with regard to the size of the 16-bit market, I don’t think you guys -- don’t want to quantify that in the past. I guess, any guidance you can give us in terms of the size of that business relative to microcontrollers?
Steve Sanghi: We are not willing to break it out soon.
Chris Caso: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Rosenberg from William Blair.
Jeff Rosenberg: Good afternoon.
Gordon Parnell: Hello Jeff.
Jeff Rosenberg: I guess I just want to ask about the inventory trends, bringing them down five days or so for quarter. Does that reflect any change in your strategy in terms of the rate of ramp in your production or the way you are tying to manage margins you know, through any correction of whatever point we might see one?
Steve Sanghi: What I like investors to look at is this you know, the center pulling offer inventory range over the last many, many years has been right around here about 101 days where we were last quarter and the distributor inventory is sitting on the lower end of the range of 1.9 to 3.3, so if you combine the channel inventory plus Microchip inventory together, they are less than the middle point of the inventory. So first of all, I do not understand where all the inventory concerns are coming form. And number two, our inventory has been steadily declining, so if you were to ramp up factories harder where the inventories were not declining the gross margins will even be higher. We are still producing record gross margins while the inventories are declining. So essentially what we are trying to do is get the inventories a little bit more than the midpoint, last quarter they were in the midpoint, get it a little bit more lower and then start to ramp the factories to the point where the inventories do not decline, essentially keep up, build as much as we feel.
Jeff Rosenberg: And have you adjusted that level of ‘ramp it all’ from where you -- I mean, or has it been pretty stale. I guess, you have been bringing inventories down to pretty consistent level, but if you have done anything in terms of your planning differently than what you were thinking a quarter ago?
Steve Sanghi: You know, we ramp every quarter. Every quarter we are producing more products than the prior quarter, but every quarter despite the ramp we have been producing product less than what we have been shipping. That’s why the inventory has been declining and I think Gordon guided that the next quarter our inventory drops again from 101 days to 95 days. So at that point in time we are coming to the point where almost the inventory is right. So you know, basically during this quarter, it will be -- and I mentioned we are putting things in place to essentially ramp harder where the inventory does not decline anymore after that, maybe decline a little bit, but not much.
Jeff Rosenberg: Okay. And then the follow up I want to ask you was just if there is any color commentary on the relative strength of the different regions and the weakness, not weakness, but the much lower growth in the Americas versus Asia, is that just the traditional continuation of mix over to Asia or anything more that you could say about that?
Steve Sanghi: Well you know, the overall activity in Asia is higher. It is a much stronger growth region I believe than in Americas or Europe, that’s one point. And second point is, like you mentioned there is a continuous transfer of designs, which are done in US and then if we go to Asia for manufacturing so it’s very, very hard to break out. I mean if you have ten customers you can do the analysis, even 50 customers you could do the analysis. For 50,000 customers it’s impossible, so we know a significant portion of that growth in Asia is because of designs in US, but we can’t quantify that.
Jeff Rosenberg: Okay, yeah just seemed a little bit more diversion than usual, so that there is maybe something to add, perhaps not. Okay, thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: I remember Asia is coming off -- in the prior period as well in terms its growth, so you’ve got to compare that shipping period in the June or what drives the revenues in the June period versus the prior quarter also.
Jeff Rosenberg: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Next we will hear from Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski Goldman Sachs: Thanks, hi Steve. Just wanted to dig into your bookings number a little bit more. I think you have said your book to bill is 1.01 and then I think the 16-bit book to bill was 1.5, so I know that even through that’s a pretty small piece of your business filled out would seem to imply that the remaining business has a book to bill that maybe flatter, may be slightly bellow one, I just wanted to see that math make sense and also what that implies.
Steve Sanghi: Well, without knowing exact price of 16-bit, it’s hard to do the calculation, but in generally you will be correct, yes. Our overall book to bill was 1.01 and 16-bit was 1.5.
Simona Jankowski Goldman Sachs: So how about bookings for the rest of the business or maybe slightly bellow 1.0 book to bill and normally your September quarter tends to be an up 5% quarter kind of historically. And I think you had mentioned earlier you had record bookings in April and May, and July started off well. Can you maybe just piece it all together and just kind of give us a sense to why the bookings are maybe a bit mismatched for the guidance?
Ganesh Moorthy: Well Simona, I’d say -- something I have said for ten years in the history of Microchip, our business has never correlated to book to bill ratio. I will tell you periods of four, five, six quarters in a row where book to bill is 1 or slightly less than 1 and business has grown 4%, 5%, 6% sequentially. When the lead times are three to five weeks we see absolutely no reason why customer has to place a large amount of bookings in the prior quarter. Customer can give us the order today and we will ship it to them in the next three weeks. So during that environment you know, whether the bookings are 1 or 0.99 or 1.01, I don’t think it makes any difference. That’s why we don’t break out the terms anymore because it just has never correlated in our business.
Simona Jankowski: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: We will take your next question from Chris Danely from JP Morgan.
Chris Danely: Thanks guys. On the 16-bit mix, so Steve you are basically saying that the mix issue should be over by the end of this quarter?
Steve Sanghi: That’s correct, yes.
Chris Danely: Great. And then on the long-term gross margin target of 62%, can you give us a sense of I guess what revenue or what matrix we need to see to achieve this 62%?
Steve Sanghi: I think we you know, we guided, you know couple of quarters ago we said in the next eight to ten quarters and we are basically maintaining that, so you know, you could see we were going up every quarter by you know, 20 to 25 basis points and one quarter could be little more, one quarter could be little less. We are ready to ramp our factories here with the inventory getting below than midpoint after this quarter so essentially, you should -- you know, we expect to achieve that over the next couple of years at least.
Chris Danely: That’s fine and then any update on the Foundry business?
Steve Sanghi: What update are you looking for there?
Chris Danely: What products or what percent of revenue Foundry is right now?
Steve Sanghi: It’s low single digits, it’s really a very small portion of the business.
Chris Danely: Okay, great. And then last question you know, even though the book to bill doesn’t really matter, when was the last time your book to bill was below one for 8-bit micros, do you remember?
Steve Sanghi: No, we don’t.
Chris Danely: Has it been a while or …?
Steve Sanghi: It has been below one probably in the last few quarters when we have even grown, so we have done substantial growth with less than one book to bill ratio in the past period.
Chris Danely: Okay, thanks.
Operator: [Operator instructions]. We will take our next question from Eric Gomberg from Thomas Weisel.
Eric Gomberg: Hey, guys nice result and nice job managing your inventories and the general inventories.
Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you.
Eric Gomberg: Most of my questions have been answered. Just one thing that stood out was the 16-bit development tools up by 129% sequentially; seems pretty huge. Could you talk a little about that and how that correlates to potential shipment growth of 16-bit products out of couple of quarters?
Steve Sanghi: Well you know, the lead-time for developing a 16-bit product and taking into market is more like two years, it takes about two years. So the large growth of development tools does not really mean much for revenue in the next couple of quarters. The revenue that comes in the last couple of quarters is based on the work we did six quarters ago and there were substantial amount of work done six quarters ago, the backlog looks very healthy, the book to bill is extremely high on the 16-bit microcontroller. We are looking for very, very solid growth year. The new development tool simply tells you that just the party is continuing. The growth is continuing and there are more and more customers, designing with it and we are just opening a large number of new doors.
Eric Gomberg: Planting the seeds for ‘08 and ’09?
Steve Sanghi: What is that?
Eric Gomberg: Planting the seeds for ‘08 and ‘09.
Steve Sanghi: Yeah, yeah, ‘08 and ‘09 yes. Very late ‘07 calendar year, but really going into early ‘08.
Eric Gomberg: Okay, thanks. And just on orders by geography, I think there is a lot of concern about that build up of inventory in Asia and don’t want to be a dead horse, and you had commented on overall inventory. Would you feel that there is any difference by geography, is there any difference in terms of what these or others might be holding in Asia?
Gordon Parnell: No the distribution, the key categories have always been somewhat different. In Asia probably because of the matrix in their business have always tended to hold a little less than inventories and than the average. Their margins are quite lower, often they are looking to returns to earnings ratios, appropriate for their business. And while we have seen over the course of many, many quarters, the inventory moved down towards the low end of the range. We have moved down in all territories. I wouldn’t say exactly all the same page, but relatively speaking we have all behaved pretty much the same way as this tried out to be, I think improved asset managers.
Steve Sanghi: So, I think what you were concerned about is that maybe the inventory in Asia is high, but Gordon is telling you is in our case, inventory in Asia is much lower than the inventory in distribution we have seen in US and Europe.
Eric Gomberg: That was very helpful, thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Yeah.
Operator: We will take our next question from Harsh Kumar from Morgan Keegan.
Harsh Kumar: Hey guys, congratulations on a great quarter and then growth in a questionable economy, but had a kind of broader question. You are clearly taking share from other people but Steve, if I was to ask you to kind of characterize how you see the overall market maybe you can give us some color on whether you think the overall market is growing you know, your company aside?
Steve Sanghi: You know, it’s very hard to tell as we are going through the quarters whether the market is growing or not. I think we get a report that looks at everybody’s numbers at the end of the year, which gives us some reflection, but we really are not paying attention whether the market is growing or not, we are paying attention to are we growing or not.
Harsh Kumar: Great, thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy: When you look at the 8-bit microcontrollers, it seems like you know number of players which are on the top you know, one, two, three, four, five they all you know, short-term here seemed to be doing well and each may claim they’re gaining market share from the other person, but I think they are really gaining market share from the middle of the pack or the people in the low end of the pack or they’re all gaining through new applications in their respective territories. You know I believe we are growing and the latest numbers we saw from Freescale, seems like they are growing, will hear from Atmel next week, and I think most likely, we will see they are growing. Slightest decline in that segment, I saw, but it’s possible that a couple of other guys may be growing. So it doesn’t mean the 8-bit microcontroller market is growing. We have always felt for years that 8-bit microcontroller is a very good market, but somehow that growth never seemed to correlate with the SIA numbers, which has been the age-old difference. So either SIA numbers are not correct because they don’t have the data from a lot of the non-members or it’s possible that many of these companies are gaining market share over much weaker competitors, which are really at the bottom of the middle of the pack.
Harsh Kumar: Good, that’s very helpful. Just one follow-up, I think in the commentary guys, you might have given a 16-bit sequential growth number for September, and I might have missed that if you gave that, if you don’t mind repeating it?
Steve Sanghi: Say it again …?
Harsh Kumar: The 16-bit sequential growth number for September?
Steve Sanghi: We made 25% to 35% sequential growth.
Harsh Kumar: Thanks guys, great quarter.
Operator: Next we will hear from Adam Parker from Sanford Bernstein.
Adam Parker: Yeah. Hi, just a couple of more quick questions here. Steve, I know the markets really appreciate the dividend increases, but given as you said, the market seems determined to you know, create bad news or keep the stock low, why wouldn’t you be more aggressive with the buybacks here? I know you guys have bought your stock well in the past. Why wouldn’t you a bit more aggressive here?
Steve Sanghi: Well, some of the broken records here our strategy always is to give the money back to the investors, it is their money, and if they feel their stock is cheap they can buy more stock. Stock dividends go down by the good holders of the investors who keep this for long time. We will give the money back to them and they can invest the money into the stock, if they believe it is cheap or they can be give to their investors or do whatever they like with that. You know, our goal is in general, that we believe in dividend, we do not believe in stock buyback. We buy stock only at unusual locations and last time we bought significant amount of stock was during SARS when you know, stock was selling at half the price that it sold six months later. You know, you may make an argument such time may be approaching, I hope not. But in general, our values and where our board believes strongly is to a continuous growth of dividends to give the money back to the shareholders and let them invest it.
Adam Parker: Well one -- I don’t know, corollary to that is as you all know your company’s fundamentals, the revenue growth, the stock and the margins are very stable among the best in the industry yet your stock itself, if you look at the standard deviation of volatility returns, is about an average or even slightly more volatile than average for broad semiconductor peer group. Why do you seem that is, do you think it is something you are doing, do you think there is something that market doesn’t get? How do you explain –- how do you think about the difference between the stability of your fundamentals and the stability of your stock?
Steve Sanghi: Adam, I thought you were the analyst. I am the CEO, I don’t know. You know, I don’t understand the market. My job is to run the company, and I’m doing a damn good job at it.
Adam Parker: I’m not doing a good job, but I was just trying to –- that’s why I was trying to get your help.
Steve Sanghi: You know, analyzing what the stock does is neither my expertise nor my job. I deliver great results and you know, it’s now everybody else’s job to take these great results and analyze them and position it accordingly.
Adam Parker: But you know, I mean all of us try to look internally and say it’s only worth doing.  I mean, is it something where you think you are setting your near term expectations or you are optimistic to the point where people try to play against them in the near term or is it just -- look I can’t worry about it, just deliver the good results and screw it eventually, it will take care of itself.
Steve Sanghi: I mean, it is not destroyed. I mean we are working hard. We went though a lot of conferences last quarter including yours and see a lot of investors and analysts and trying to explain the story, and I think we have explained the 8-bit story; conversion to flash microcontrollers, we are delivering that results on that. And the 16-bit story we are delivering that result from that. Analog was a little weak last quarter only 1% growth. We will come back and show you more growth there. We are delivering the margins, we are you know, making the ramp in the Fab. We have just generated record cash flow, increased the dividend again. Done all those things, but market always finds something to worry about. All quarter market has been worried about inventories. We come back and our own inventory has declined, the distribution inventory is flat. Somebody asked a question about Asia. Asia inventory is less than it is in US and Europe, and somebody else was further asking questions on the book to bill. You know, I just got this number in front of me. September quarter last year, September fiscal year ‘06, which will be September quarter last year, our book to bill ratio was 1, and in December quarter we grew 3.5% sequentially. So somebody had asked the question whether you know, have you had that cash before, so here was the quarter where the book to bill was barely one, it was only up to one and our growth was 3.5% in the following December quarter. We have done that lots and lots of different times. When the lead times are so short then book to bill and terms required don’t matter, whether people place the order on June 25th or you know July 3rd, it will absolutely make no difference. Does that help?
Adam Parker: Yeah I appreciate. Steve, thanks.
Operator: We will take our final question from Craig Ellis from Citigroup.
Craig Ellis: Thank you, good afternoon guys. I will start just by approaching the dividend a little bit differently. Steve, you guys have done a great job, raising the dividends. The people I talked to, liked the job you’ve done with it. Can you talk about how comfortable you are continuing at the current pace in terms of that frequency with which you increased the quarterly dividend?
Steve Sanghi: We have guided that we expect to generate about $500 million of free cash flow this quarter, this year. And if you look at the last two quarters, I think we are well on that pace to do that. So you know, as long as the earnings continue to rise which we are guiding towards and guiding for another $0.02 increase next quarter in earnings, we believe you know dividend is announced by the board and they are not here in the room, I believe they are comfortable with continuing to share that cash with investors. Now over time the rate of growth has to slow down -- off the dividend, you know as the numbers get larger and larger but you know we just increased it sequentially 9.3%, that’s really a pretty torrid pace.
Craig Ellis: It is, and as long as there is growth in the various businesses and we will obviously at different points see cyclical dynamics in play, but if we could expect you to continue to increase the dividends is what you’re saying.
Steve Sanghi: Yeah, we expect to continue to increase dividend, yeah.
Craig Ellis: Okay, and then just cycling back on the 16-bit business, 20 new products in Q2, it sounds like there is going to be 10 new products in Q3, how should we think about the pace at which you want to bring out new products in that part of the business?
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know, every new product development you know, doesn’t take the same time. It’s like you know they are platforms, it takes much longer to develop a platform and come up with the first -- you know, two or three products and after that you are proliferating it based on memory sizes and adding non-peripherals and stuff like that. So you know some times you are developing a brand new platform including new peripherals and other time you are proliferating existing peripherals, so don’t think of it like you know, 20 products last year, 10 products this year -- you know, like some thing is wrong.  It’s just like this is you know, huge pipeline and some times people are working on tail end of releasing the products, other time they are working on the front end of developing new peripherals, new capability, new stuff that’s going to open new markets, this kind of happens all the time.
Craig Ellis: But is it reasonable to think that if over the last quarter and the current quarter you are doing 10-to 20 per quarter that over time that that pace would increase or you had a comfortable pace for how you see that business over the next 18 months or so?
Steve Sanghi: Well, let me see if Ganesh is comfortable giving the number about the number of new products in having production by the end of the fiscal year.
Ganesh Moorthy: Yeah, our -- we are in a pace where we will have somewhere between 90 and 100 products in production by the end of fiscal year itself.
Steve Sanghi: There you go, some 65 now to you know 90 to 100 products by the end of March.
Craig Ellis: Okay, thanks guys.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: We actually do have another question from Janet Ramkissoon from Quadra Capital
Steve Sanghi: Hello Janet.
Janet Ramkissoon: Hi guys, congratulations, another nice quarter, thanks for the dividend. Steve, just in terms of the expansion and buying equipment, is your strategy still to try to buy used equipment where you can?  And given the growth in your business, when do you think you might have to visit the question of whether or not you pick up another facility, perhaps there might be an opportunity if we do have a real semiconductor downturn here?
Steve Sanghi: Janet, you know first part of your question, yes we buy used equipment whenever we can. Our equipment needs are not very high here because we have largely the equipment available to what we need. We only need you know a little bit of equipment because the process which was running in fast-forward prior to our purchase was not identical to our process, it was close enough. So it’s like a 90% match so we really need a small amount of equipment here and there, but we also need -- a portion of the equipment expense is also in assembly and test, R&D and Care and other areas. So yes, we do buy used equipment wherever we can. In terms of looking at another Fab, we believe it is way too early because in the last quarter or so we have highlighted for investors our path to $1.9 billion where the two existing Fabs have current capacity of -- installed capacity of $1.4 billion. There is clean room available in our Fab4 to expand it further where the combined capacity of two Fabs becomes $1.7 billion, and we are outsourcing a portion of our product lines in, 8 bit, 16 bit analogue and all the different products which will give us about $200 million of output which will not be produced by us, but will be outsourced to professional foundries over the next five yeas, leading up to a total about $1.9 million. So I think it is quite early for us to think of any other Fab.
Janet Ramkissoon: Okay, just on last little one if I may -- just in terms of the economy worldwide. Are you beginning to see any signs of slowdown any where or are there any particular -- you know, unusual strength in any area in your markets worldwide?
Steve Sanghi: We are not seeing problems any where, we grew in all three geographies last quarter, in the current quarter we expect to grow in Americas we expect to grow in Asia, Europe obviously is you know, down low single digits usually in the summer quarter but Asia geography usually very strong this quarter, because the tail end of September they start to build all the products for the Christmas which has to get on the ships for -- you know six weeks journey back to US and Europe, so this is -- this should be usually a very, very good quarter and we are not seeing softness anywhere in the world driven by any of the Macro factories.
Janet Ramkissoon: Thanks very much.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome
Operator: There are no further questions at this time, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Steve Sanghi for closing remark.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you very much to all the investors and analysts who joined this call today. We will be available here for a little while, if you have questions, give us a call on the investor line otherwise we will talk to you during the quarter either at the conferences or in our road shows or other things or talk to you next quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: And that concludes today conference call and we thank you for joining us. At this time you may now disconnect your line.
Steve Sanghi: Bye-bye.

===== 2006 Q4  (2006-04-26 18:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Microchip Technology fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006 financial results conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead sir.
Gordon Parnell: Thanks, Justin. Good afternoon, and welcome to everybody. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events of the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results may differ materially. We would refer you to our press release of today as well as our 10K for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 2005 and our 8-K current reports that we have filed with the FCC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operation. In attendance with me today is Steve Sanghi,, Microchip's President and CEO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006 performance, reviewing geographic data and discussing balance sheet and cash information. Steve will then give his comments on the results, outline our guidance for the June quarter, and update other matters regarding our business. We'll then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Let's get going. Net sales for the March quarter were at record levels of $247.2 million, which were up approximately 5.2% from net sales of $234.9 million in the immediately preceding quarter and up approximately 18.8% from net sales of $208.1 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Net sales for fiscal year 2006 were a record $927.9 million, up approximately 9.6% from fiscal 2005. On an earnings basis, our GAAP net income for the March quarter was at record levels of $75.6 million or $0.35 s per diluted share, an increase of 6.8% from non-GAAP net income of $70.7 million or $0.33 per diluted share from the immediately preceding quarter, and an increase of 34% from GAAP net income of $56.4 million or $0.27 per share from the prior year's fourth quarter. Non-GAAP results for the immediately preceding quarter exclude the effects of the one-time tax charge associated with the repatriation of earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for fiscal 2006 was a record at $273 million or $1.27 per diluted share, an increase of 20.4% from net income of $226.8 million or $1.07 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year. On a GAAP basis, net income for fiscal 2006 was also at record levels of $242.4 million, or $1.13 for diluted share. That was up 13.4% from net income of $213.8 million or $1.01 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year. This marks our 62nd consecutive quarter of profitability, achieving approximately $1.3 billion in cumulative earnings for Microchip and our shareholders. Geographically, sales in Europe grew by approximately 18%; Americas grew about 9%;, and Asia fell by approximately 4%. Asia reflecting the seasonal factors related to the lunar New Year holidays. Asia continues to be our largest geography, representing approximately 42% of sales. Americas was 29.25% of sales, and Europe the balance at 28.75% of sales. This measurement for the three geographies is based on whether a product is delivered for manufacturing purposes per a customer's request. It doesn't represent where the design activity is taking place. Obviously, many designs in Americas and Europe migrate to Asia to access more cost-effective manufacturing opportunities. In the quarter, we established record gross margins of 60.1%, reflecting the propriety of product positioning relative to pricing, world-class manufacturing yields and efficiencies, and richer product mix. We are very pleased with the continued improvement in gross margins that we have delivered to the market. Over the last fiscal year, our gross margins have improved approximately 275 basis points, significantly improving our operating leverage. Our current gross margins have crossed an important milestone at 60% and are an excellent indicator that we can meet our long-term gross margin target of 62%. Operating expenses were 23.9% of sales overall in the March quarter. This compared to operating expenses of 23.7% in the previous quarter. Research and development costs were $24.5 million representing 9.9% of sales, and SG&A expenses were $34.6 million representing 14% of sales. The tax rate for the March quarter was in line with our guidance of 24%. Our tax rate for fiscal 2006, after adjusting for the one-time tax charge, associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act I mentioned earlier, was also 24%. Inclusive of this charge, the tax rate was 32.5%. The dividend we declared today of $0.215 was an increased dividend of approximately 13.2% sequentially, and an increase of 126% over the same quarter in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, our dividend payments totaled approximately $120 million and the dividend just declared would represent an annual rate of dividend payment of approximately $183 million. Overall in fiscal 2006, we established new record levels in net sales, net income, earnings per share, gross margins and operating margins as well as obviously dividend payments. Let's turn our attention to the balance sheet now and go through some of that information. First of all in Microchip's inventory, our total inventory position at March 31st was approximately $115 million with days of inventory representing 106 days. This is lower by 5 days from inventory levels at the end of the previous quarter. In distribution, our inventory continues to be at very moderate levels in all geographies. As of the end of the March, our distributors held about two months of inventory. This is essentially flat with the prior quarter. Given the industry conditions and the level of inventories at distribution, we are comfortable with the overall level of inventories we have supporting our business today. Looking at our receivables at March 31st, Microchip's receivable days were essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. Overall trade receivable balance increased approximately $27.4 million from the end of December. The delta between the revenue growth and the receivable growth can be contributed to several factors. These include the fact that the strongest growth in the quarter came from the European region where customers' payment terms are generally longer than our other geographies.  We saw an increase in dollar value of inventories at distributors, which is not recognized in net sales, due to our revenue recognition being based on sell-through criteria. Lastly, we had more back end waiting for revenues in Asia, which related to the lunar New Year in that particular geography. We certainly don't have any concerns regarding the growth of the receivables, more an indication of improving cash flows in the current period. In our overall cash position as of March 31st, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1.3 billion with $269 million of short-term debt on the balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated net cash flow from the business of $110 million, prior to the dividend payment of $40.5 million. With the adoption of FAS 115, our investments are reported differently than before. In our balance sheet presentation, investments are split between current and long-term assets based on the criteria of FAS 115. Cash balances will continue to be reported in current assets, and all three categories are included in our total cash and investment position of $1.3 billion. The borrowings on our balance sheet relate to transactions associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. To complete the repatriation of $500 million, we initiated certain borrowings which were collateralized against investments that were held in the foreign locations, allowing investments to reach their normal maturity date. We expect these borrowings to be paid down in the next four quarters, as the investments mature and new cash is also generated in these particular locations. There is no net income effect during this timeframe, as the interest income on the funds repatriated essentially offset the interest expense on the borrowings. Looking at capital depreciation, our capital expense, our spending was approximately $33 million for the March quarter. Depreciation expense for the same period for March was $26.9 million versus $28.7 million for the same quarter last fiscal year and $26.8 million in the December quarter. Capital spending for the fiscal year was $75 million versus $63 million in fiscal '05. Depreciation for 2006 was $109 million versus $119 million in the prior year. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $80 million, and depreciation of approximately $115 million for fiscal 2007. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2006 continue to be extremely strong, reaching record levels of $450 million in net cash generated prior to the dividends of $120 million that I mentioned earlier and stock buyback activity of approximately $3 million. During fiscal 2007 we anticipate that net cash flow prior to dividends will be approximately $500 million. Microchip will adopt FAS 123R for fiscal years beginning April 1st, 2006 and based on investor feedback, Microchip's board has determined to use restricted share units, RSUs as the equity vehicle to incentivize our employees. RSUs will replace stock options as the primary long-term compensation vehicle at Microchip. Based on our analysis of FAS 123R implementation, we anticipate an earnings impact of between 7% and 8% during fiscal 2007. We will report earnings on a GAAP basis, as well as excluding the effects of the stock compensation costs, to allow investors and analysts to understand the adoption of FAS 123R. With that, I'll ask Steve to discuss the performance of our business, our guidance in the June quarter and update other business matters.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Gordon. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I would like to reflect on the results of the March quarter as well as the fiscal year 2006, and then comment on the product lines, update you on our distribution strategy and on our fab manufacturing capacity, and finally discuss the guidance for the June 2006 quarter. So let's begin. I'm extremely proud of our continuing excellent execution in delivering yet another record quarter and another record fiscal year in every respect. We exceeded our original guidance in net sales, in gross margin percentage, and in EPS. Net sales were $247.2 million, which was an all-time record. Gross margin of 60.1% was also a record, up 40 basis points sequentially. Our operating profit was another record at 36.2%, and EPS of $0.35, exceeding our original guidance by $0.01, and it also set another all-time record. From a fiscal year standpoint, we achieved a record net sales of approximately $928 million in fiscal 2006. Gross margin was also a record at 59.4% and non-GAAP EPS was a record $1.27. Non-GAAP EPS excludes the effect of foreign earnings repatriation that Gordon talked about. Now I shall talk about the product lines. First the microcontrollers. The microcontrollers business grew 4.9% sequentially and was up 17.8% over a year ago quarter. Our flash microcontrollers business was very strong and grew by a robust 9.6% sequentially and up 42% over a year ago quarter. Flash microcontrollers now represent over 58% of our microcontrollers business. We also shipped a record 19,991 development tools last quarter and also a record 73,705 development tools in the fiscal year 2006. Development tools shipped in fiscal 2006 were up 38.3% from those shipped in fiscal 2005. We are continuing to experience strong design activity with our 8-bit flash microcontrollers, and we're seeing a significant number of new applications emerging which are utilizing our products. We are very well-positioned to continue to gain market share in this segment. Gartner DataQuest released a 2005 Microcontrollers Market Share Report just last week, which confirmed again that Microchip is continuing to gain market share in 8-bit microcontrollers. Of the top four suppliers who have a combined 52% of the 8-bit microcontrollers market, Microchip was the only company that grew year-over-year. The other three companies -- Freescale, Renaissance and NEC -- all experienced a year-over-year decline in 8-bit microcontrollers sales. Now, 16-bit microcontrollers. Our 16-bit microcontrollers business was up a whopping 46% sequentially in the March quarter, albeit from a small base. So far the growth off our 16-bit microcontrollers business is higher than that of our high-end 8 bit microcontrollers architecture, Pic18. The number of customers on 16-bit grew to 324 in the March quarter from 236 in the December quarter. Based on that metric, the customer penetration is proceeding as expected. We shipped 1,284 new development tools last quarter, on 16-bit for a cumulative total of 12,671 development tools supporting our 16-bit products. In terms of total number of products, we now have 45 16-bit microcontrollers in production, 30 more products are sampling, out of which 20 will be in production by the end of the June quarter. Based on the momentum with customers we see, we expect 16-bit microcontrollers to be up another 20% sequentially in the June quarter. Serial E-squared memory products net sales were flat, sequentially. We are continuing to focus on serving our strategic customers whatever we can attach Serial E-squared to a microcontroller or an analog product. Pricing remained essentially flat quarter over quarter. Analog products, analog products showed very strong performance and were up another 17.4% sequentially, and up 52% over a year ago quarter. We believe that we outgrew nearly all of our analog competitors and are gaining market share in analog. The design momentum on analog products has been very strong and we see continuing growth ahead. We expect a growth of about 7% in the analog order, we expect a growth of about 7% in analog in the June quarter, sequentially. Now our distribution strategy. Some investors and analysts have asked us questions about our distribution strategy. Microchip has two kinds of distributors: global distributors and regional distributors. Regional distributors are mainly in Asia and Europe, and they usually do not carry competing lines. These regional distributors have significant dedicated technical resources for Microchip, and they are demand creators. We are continuing to add regional distributors in Europe and Asia. The second kind of distributors is global distributors with a very broad line card. These distributors essentially carry most, if not all, of our competitors' products too. Therefore, the loyalty of these distributors is essentially split, and the technical resources are pulled into too many different directions. Microchip has not seen these global distributors being very efficient in creating demand. On the other hand, these global distributors are very efficient in fulfilling demand once the customer has designed in a product. So over the last two years, Microchip has steadily taken more and more control of its demand creation by adding a significant number of direct sales and technical application engineering resources. At the same time we have lowered the margin we paid to the global distributors since they largely provide fulfillment. This strategy has worked extremely well. Our continued success in 8-bit microcontrollers, and a very strong growth in 16-bit microcontrollers as well as in analog is essentially vindicating this strategy. We have also seen other semiconductor suppliers like Altera, Xilinx, Analog Devices and Linear Technology make similar moves. The large number of resources that Microchip has added to direct as well as regional distributors is creating record demand for our products. Fab capacity. I wanted to give you an update on Microchip's fab capacity since that's another question we often get from investors. We have been telling you that fab 2 and fab 4 combined, we have a total install the capacity of about $1.4 billion. Beyond that, we have additional clean room space available in fab 4 to take that number higher than $1.4 billion. But in the past, we have not dollarized that number. So we are prepared to do that today based on fresh analysis that we have completed. We believe that additional clean room space available in fab 4 will allow us to take the internal capacity to about $1.7 billion. Second, we have been silently building a Foundry strategy for a portion of our business, utilizing such technologies which are either not available in Microchip's sad or they have lower volume and hence not cost effective to develop them internally. We will not be giving any details of what we plan to build outside due to competitive reasons, however, because of very proprietary and value-added products being developed at Foundry's, we do not see any of impact of that on our gross margin percentage. We currently see the Foundry business becoming about 10% of Microchip's sales over the next five years from the low single digits, it is today. So combining these two factors together, we believe that we have fab capacity to take Microchip from today's run rates to about $1.9 billion. Therefore, we are confident for low CapEx and very high free cash flows well into the future. Now I shall discuss our guidance for the June 2006 quarter. As we look at the June quarter, we took several factors into account. First we saw only a muted effect of lunar New Year driven seasonality in the March quarter. Therefore, June quarter will grow from the base of a pretty strong March quarter. Second, we achieved record bookings in the March quarter with a book to bill ratio of 1.07. The bookings so far in April are extremely strong and at a record pace. Third, we have strong momentum in all of our strategic product lines of 8-bit flash microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers, and analog. So taking all of these factors into account and after checking expectations from our direct as well as distributor channels, we expect net sales in the June quarter to be up 5% to 6% sequentially. Gross margins are expected to be about 60.3% to 60.5% this quarter. I remind investors that our long-term growth margin guidance is 62% and we're inching up towards that goal with about 25 basis points improvement every quarter. This gross margin guidance is without the effect of equity compensation expense. Earnings per share, again without equity compensation expense are expected to be about $0.37 , $0.02 higher than the last quarter. The earnings per share with equity compensation expense for the June quarter should be about $0.35, so a total of $0.02 impact from the equity compensation. We expect to build approximately $120 million of net cash flow before payment of $45.8 million of dividends just announced today and we look forward to sharing this cash with investors with another healthy increase in dividends in the next quarter. I also wanted to briefly talk about the lead times. Despite exceptionally strong bookings, our lead times remain in the three-to-six weeks range, which are the shortest amongst our competitors. We are monitoring inventories at Microchip, as well as at our distributors, very carefully. So far, last quarter our inventories went down by five days while our distributors' inventories were flat in number of days. Therefore, we do not see any overbuilding of inventories at Microchip or in our distribution channel. Finally, I have been telling investors and analysts about my new book for about a year now. The book titled Driving Excellence was finally released two weeks ago. I hope that all long-term investors and analysts will read the book. It gets you inside Microchip to look at how the aggregate system of Microchip was built and implemented. It reveals the culture of Microchip technology, which we believe is behind the exceptional performance of Microchip for so many years. The advantages of our products, technologies and manufacturing can be more easily understood, the company built on just those platforms can be [seen] over time. The real gap in Microchip performance is credited to our exceptional culture which remains the backbone of everything we do. So please read the book, and I would love your feedback. You may also visit to www.drivingexcellence.biz, which is a website created for the book for some additional information about the book. There's also a link if you want to buy the book. Let me summarize a few key points. Our  net sales are expected to be up 5% to 6% sequentially. Now without the equity compensation expense, our gross margins are expected to be about 60.3% to 60.5%. Operating expenses to be about 24% of sales; operating profit to be about 36.3% to 36.6%. Earnings per share are expected to be about $0.37. Finally with continued strong growth of our 8-bit microcontrollers and very strong growth of our 16-bit microcontrollers, as well as analog products, we hope that we have put our investors' and analysts' concerns to rest regarding the continued top line growth of Microchip. With that, Justin, would you please poll for questions?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll take the first question from Adam Parker with Sanford Bernstein.
Adam Parker: Yes, hi. Just a couple of quick ones. Steve, in round numbers you're getting pretty close to a $1 billion revenue company. If I just think out over the future here, if I think about your next billion in revenue, when you're a $2 billion revenue company maybe a few years down the line, how much of that new $1 billion in revenue is going to come from 8-bit maybe versus 16-bit or analog? Can you just help us conceptualize that long-term, please?
Steve Sanghi: Well, Adam, as you know, we continued to not want to break out numbers for 8-bit and 16-bit either now or really in the future. None of our competition breaks it out and the information will help our competitors, I believe, more than it will help our investors.
Adam Parker: Well, I guess my question, Steve, is more about the strength in the 8-bit business, and maybe I'll ask it a different way, do you have any competition at all in flash-based 8-bit controllers? If so who is it? And when you lose a socket, if that happens, when you compete for it, why do you lose one?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we have very substantial competition in 8-bit flash microcontrollers. We compete with Freescale, Phillips, Atmel, Renaissance, NEC, some of the really smaller competitors, like Silicon Lab, a very little piece of it, but they're there, and with Cypress, So yes, there are a large number of competitors that make 8-bit Flash microcontrollers. However, if you look at this Gartner Dataquest report, in the top seven manufacturers or so, only two were up last year, ST Microelectronics was up about only 3%; everybody else was down quite significantly, while Microchip was the only company that was up. So we're really gaining market share over the entire market by a huge, more than more than 10 percentage point difference between the growth or decline of the market, which is the growth of Microchip. If you want to look at that report, it's very, very substantial. In dollar terms, the larger portion of the growth continues to come out of the 8-bit microcontrollers, and that is a market relatively most misunderstood and investors continue to not see the potential in it because the overall market either is not growing or is declining, but Microchip has grown in 8-bit microcontrollers, very, very healthy every single year with the exception of one year, which was a calendar year 2001.
Adam Parker: When you compete for something, can you share at all what happens when you lose or is that not even relevant?
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know, we have approximately what 14% of the market in dollars, about 14-15% of the market.
Adam Parker: That's for overall 8-bit., not for the Flash-based side, right?
Steve Sanghi: Flash, if you look at the flash-based , I believe we have maintained for many years about one-third of the market. I think we are about 33% to 35% of the overall market, again in round numbers Again, I don't have that in front of me. So two-thirds of the market is owned by somebody else; either a customer has a legacy with somebody else's architecture, or somebody else beat us on some price or our salesman isn't present in that account. Or it's in Japan where Microchip has relatively small share, or it's a particular product, the density, the packaging, or something we do not have. It's a competitive market, but we continue to do, very, very well.
Adam Parker: Would you say that legacy is the biggest reason? Or if you were thinking about legacy price, or your salesforce for Japan; that was very useful. Can you break down the biggest reason you might, you might lose out or?
Steve Sanghi: No, there's really no way to put percentages on what's the biggest reason you lose out. It's different by customer, it's different by geography, it's different by account. I know more, but I wouldn't want to share it with everybody because then the competition knows the same thing.
Adam Parker: It seems like in that in this quarter you really grew more rapidly than the peers in a lot of the previous quarters. I thought maybe if you would help, was there anything in particular that was driving, market-wise any new applications or anything that was driving the particularly strong performance versus the peers this quarter? It clearly looks like we'll continue in the June quarter given the guidance.
Steve Sanghi: Our business is always very broad-based. We're really never dependent on a single customer, Our business grew about 5.3% last quarter and our largest customer continues to be 2% or so of our business, and probably the largest customer shrunk. So the growth continues to happen from 50,000 accounts we serve worldwide. It's very, very broad-based. By customers, by applications, by geographies, by channels. It is really large scale, huge customer business and it can't really be analyzed regarding where the growth came from. The best we can do is really give you the growth by region like U.S., Europe, and Asia, and by product line, which we have kind of done that, broken out 16-bit percentage growth which was whopping 46% and also very strong growth in analog to give the investors a comfort that we're really gaining a very, very strong beachhead in the two very strategic markets for Microchip for future growth; one being the 16-bit microcontroller, the second being the analog. The 8-bit microcontrollers are continuing to grow actually providing the largest dollar growth still, quarter over quarter.
Adam Parker: All right. That makes sense. Gordon, are you going to provide the breakdown on COGS, R&D and SG&A for the FAS 123?
Gordon Parnell: Not in guidance. We will obviously when we report earnings. But given that we've indicated at 7% to 8%. This quarter there won't be any impact on COGS because it takes a quarter or two for that to be reflected in the P&L, so the charge in the June quarter will all be in operating expenses.
Adam Parker: Okay. Thanks guys for you time. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Masdea of Credit Suisse.
Michael Masdea: You said flat overall distributor inventories roughly, but I think your deferred income was up 17%. Is that just speaking to the strength of the distribution channel in the first quarter?
Gordon Parnell: Yes, absolutely. Distribution did extremely well in the March quarter, and needed to continue to grow their inventories to remain flat, so that's exactly what you're seeing in the deferred margin line, Michael.
Michael Masdea: And that's still looking pretty healthy into 2Q from what you're saying if I read it correctly?
Gordon Parnell: Yes, we would expect inventories to stay in this range.
Michael Masdea: Got it. Can you give us more color on that OpEx piece or just how this stock compensation is going to impact some of your profit metrics or your spending metrics for the second quarter? Any ballpark?
Steve Sanghi: Well, if you look at an overall $0.02 impact, you know, really, none in the COGS line. So all that impact is on R&D and SG&A. I think you could probably blow back pretty easily.
Michael Masdea: But over time it's going to be more on the line, correct? And we can start to see some impact there. I guess what I'm trying to say is how much can should we reset our long-term thinking based on stock compensation, if at all, for your model?
Gordon Parnell: 7% to 8% on the net line, earnings per share. . obviously, we'll get some color over the next couple of quarters as it's fully deployed. It takes a few quarters for that to be fully represented.
Michael Masdea: Okay. That's fair enough. This is the last question. You've done a great job on the capital intensity side over the last couple of years, but walk us through, or help me understand a little bit , as you get into analog, more into of some of this direct sales as you've been doing for the last couple of years, and maybe even more into 16-bit, are there any dynamics that can tweak the capital intensity?
Steve Sanghi: It really has no impact on the capital intensity. Analog business essentially shares the same processes like we have in the microcontrollers, same thing back in assembly and test, so we really have not added any business that cannot grow in our existing infrastructure.
Michael Masdea: That includes human capital too or personnel and when you're adding more FAEs, et cetera?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the human capital is being supported by significant growth in the top line, so it's contained within the operating expense. We are adding people every quarter, but, the operating expenses are staying in that range 24%.
Michael Masdea: Great and this is the last one and I'll get off. You said it's not really head-to-head competition but you see it out there; what is your kind of long-term strategic view on doing more integration into your microcontrollers and potentially getting more into programmable analog and some of the other things that product that Cypress is going after?
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know, we have those products in our portfolio. We have over 330 or 340 total microcontrollers products, there's programmable analog products in there. We just don't break it out and make a big deal about it. Those products we've had for about eight years.
Michael Masdea: Got it, thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Moving on to Mark Lipacis with Prudential.
Mark Lipacis: Thanks. Two questions, if I may. The lead times you had mentioned are averaging between three and six weeks out now. Could you just remind us if that was a change over last quarter of at this time?
Steve Sanghi: There's no change from last quarter at this time.
Mark Lipacis: Okay. Fair enough. Steve, looking into the June quarter, could you tell us how does this year, looking into the June quarter of this year, how does it compare to over the last two years? Does this feel more like 2004 or more like 2005?
Steve Sanghi: I don't remember 2004, going too far back. I'm sorry.
Mark Lipacis: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Next question comes from Chris Danely with JP Morgan.
Chris Danely: Thanks, guys, just to follow-up on Mark's question. Sounds like the lead times are stable, but a little bit extended. Is it your intent to bring those down, or do you think they'll just stay here for the rest of the year?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think, you know, three to six weeks are the shortest lead time in the industry right now. Many of our competitors' lead times are 50% to 100% higher. We have very, very strong bookings; very, very strong momentum in essentially all of our product lines and I think it will be tough to bring these lead times shorter. They don't really come in less than three weeks, that's just the minimum lead time gets if you've got it under-stocked; but even if the product is available in stock, we essentially quote about three weeks or so, which takes time to finish our market in the appropriate quantity and design that the customer wants and ship it to wherever in the world they want the product. So the minimum lead time you always quote is about three weeks, so three to six weeks is really as short as it gets.
Chris Danely: Just to talk about the Foundry business a little bit. Are these going to be parts you guys do not have out right now? Could they be non-microcontrollers or non-analog products?
Steve Sanghi: We are not going to reveal anything further on the Foundry business. What I could say is none of those products are the products where we make inside of Microchip and we're going to farm it out. So these are all additional products which will expand our servable market and help our business grow in all different product lines.
Chris Danely: But are they going to be microcontrollers or analog, or could they be something different?
Steve Sanghi: All different product lines including those, yes.
Chris Danely: Just to follow up on that, you said it's not going to affect gross margins, but do you think that this could keep your capital intensity declining over time, or do you expect the same kind of capital intensity with the foundry business?
Steve Sanghi: Well, in five years it becomes 10% of the business, so it's very low-single digits today, so that's a fairly small impact. You're talking about 1.5% to 2% of the business going to the Foundry, which doesn't have a huge impact on capital intensity. Our capital intensity is low for the next several years, because  internal capacity can go from the $1 billion that we are today to $1.7 billion and then the outside fab gives you another last couple of hundred million dollars to $1.9 billion. So it's a combination of all that.
Chris Danely: Steve, can you just explain the decision to go and start doing ROM-based microcontrollers, and also are these gross margins the same as the other programmable micros?
Steve Sanghi: We have done a few ROM-based microcontrollers, going back even many, many years. Even though essentially high 90% of our business is field programmable microcontrollers, the overall field programmable microcontrollers are approximately 40% of total microcontrollers. So, 60% of the business continues to be ROM-based microcontrollers, and our business is growing continuously by showing customers how to design with flash and design away ROM. However, that's a significant additional available market, and we'll continue to be there for years and years and years. Although the market is shrinking. So having really negligible entry into that market, if you can take a piece of that market while the market is converting to flash, I think it helps Microchip keep it growth rate higher, and then gives customers a solution in certain cases where they do want a ROM-based microcontrollers in our architecture. See what happens many times is customer would say well, I love your product, I love your architecture, it's a great product, I like your delivery performance, your cost, and everything else; we have done business with you on our Pic-based microcontrollers, but I have these applications where I would rather use the ROM. And if the ROM isn't available in this architecture, then they will go off and design somebody else. So it's basically allows us to incrementally capture a customer whose heart we already captured with our architecture.
Chris Danely: Are they pin for pin compatible with other companies' microcontrollers?
Gordon Parnell: Absolutely pin for pin compatible, yes.
Chris Danely: Are the margins a little bit lower than your other products?
Steve Sanghi: Yes, they're pin for pin compatible with our microcontrollers, not with the competition's.
Chris Danely: Got it. And are the margins the same as your other products?
Steve Sanghi: I don't know, micros would be similar, yes. We don't break it out on individual products, but it's not going to be enough of a business to really make any kind of difference.
Chris Danely: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski: Hi, thanks for taking my call. I just have a quick near-term question, first, and then a longer-term question. On near term it looks like your analog and 16-bit business has accelerated pretty significantly since your March 6th update. I just wanted to see if you have a sense of what drove that acceleration?
Steve Sanghi: Well, there are is not one specific customer or something; we have a large number of customers growing and the business has done very well. In the analog business it was up about 17%, 18% last quarter, so I'm not sure it has necessarily accelerated. We did extremely well in December quarter, and this quarter was up again 17.4%. The 16-bit microcontrollers was up I think about 18% or 19% in December quarter and is up significantly more this quarter because there, the product went to production about two years ago, so there are thousands of customers with development tool in hand are designing from it, and you can't accurately predict within a quarter when the customer is going to finish design and start buying volume production. So there, clearly, more of the customers have gone to production and that business has accelerated, but for the analog, it went up 52% year-over-year and last quarter up 17%, so it really all wasn't driven by last quarter alone.
Simona Jankowski: Okay and then just for a longer term, more industry trends kind of question. We've been noticing some interesting new introductions in the 32-bit arena which is in a very, very low cost; partly seems like they've been enabled by a new core by arm. I've noticed also that you've filed a lawsuit against one of the start-ups which just launched one of these $1, 32-bit microcontrollers.. And just wanted to get your perspective on, is this ever going to be a real competitive threat kind of down the line for the 8-bit space, or what would be the target opportunity for these kinds of products?
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know, our 16-bit architecture that we're doing extremely well on,  significant growth, 46% growth sequentially last quarter, essentially beats the performance of an arm. So , we're winning designs against arm every day today on a performance basis, these products are a hybrid architecture. They are 24-bit internally, 16-bit outward, just like for years and years our 8-bit controllers have won designs against products like AT12 and other 16-bit products. Our 16-bit microcontrollers handily beats many of the 32-bit microcontrollers out there. So we are basically duplicating the strategy on 16-bit which we have very, very successfully deployed for many, many years on 8-bit. And I expect over the next 10 years to really see similar comments for years and years after we continue to win, what are you going to do on 32-bit? how this product will play? Essentially we have competitive products with 32-bit out in the market today and winning against 32-bit designs every day.
Simona Jankowski: Just as a quick follow-up to that. Do you think the price point though is something that has kind of changed compared to the 32-bit micros we saw years ago? Seeing them now in the $1 to $2 range do you think that's something that's a little bit new in the industry?
Steve Sanghi: Well, you could similarly see over many years people, you know introducing 16-bit microcontrollers products as much as five years ago at price points where they said it's going to wipe out 8-bit microcontrollers and many have forecasted those demises and yet our 8-bit microcontrollers business continues to do records. It's very easy to really have a PR game on a price point of, $1, or $2 or whatever. What's on that micro, what are the peripherals, what is the architecture, what is the performance, how good are the development tools, can it win the engineers' hearts who design that product? So as we engage with the customers, we continue to beat all of these architectures, and the actual cost of ownership in customers' design is significantly, significantly higher than really what is advertised for the PR purposes, generating the kind of questions you're asking. I think we have a lot of experience having seen that in 8 to 16 and now 16 to 32.
Simona Jankowski: Got it, thanks a lot, Steve.
Operator: This question comes from Romit Shah with Lehman Brothers.
Romit Shah: Thanks and congratulations on publishing the new book. Steve, one of the smaller players in the analog space  mentioned this afternoon that, sell-through is good, but just the orders could be flat to even down in Q2 as these guys are now getting back to more desired levels of inventory. You indicated that inventory levels at distributors are low, but are you encouraging them to carry even more just given the strength in your product lines?
Steve Sanghi: No, we are not encouraging distributors to carry more inventory, we have absolutely zero incentive to push distributors to carry more inventory. The inventory in our hand can be shipped to any customer or any distributor worldwide within moment's notice. Inventory sitting on a distributor's shelf can only be used for that distributor customer only in that geography. So therefore, the inventory sitting in Microchip's warehouse in Thailand is substantially more efficient in being the customers worldwide. So therefore we don't really expect the distributor inventory to rise. Our distributor inventories are about two months. The lowest we've ever been is about 1.9. So they're sitting at a very, very low end and the highest number many years ago was close to three-and-a-half months, so we actually like low distributor inventory. We do not take any shipment to distributor worldwide as revenue. Therefore, we have no incentive to really push inventory into distribution unless it's going to get sold out to the end customer.
Romit Shah: Okay. My follow-up is on incremental gross margin.  I understand that the changes will not be linear, but the decline from the mid-70% range to the high 60s last quarter. Could you just comment on the factors that drove the decrease in margin? When I think about your guidance, it sounds like you expect gross margins to be in that high 60 range. Can you comment on some of the factors, i.e. mix, or perhaps higher depreciation?
Gordon Parnell: First off, what decline, Romit?
Steve Sanghi: I think he's doing and incremental gross margin calculation as a incremental gross margin dollars divided by incremental gross margin revenues.
Romit Shah: That's correct.
Steve Sanghi: We just don't look at the business that way. There is too many different moving parts, and as we go from 60% gross margin to a long-term 62% gross margin, you basically get to the point where that incremental goes to equal to the total gross margin, so you have asymptotically approach that number. Otherwise your gross margin will continue to go higher and higher into the stratosphere which is probably not healthy for the business.
Romit Shah: Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: You're welcome.
Operator: Moving on to Shailesh Jaitly with Nomura Securities
Shailesh Jaitly: If you could help me understand the Asian part of the business. Is it more Company-specific, or are competitors also seeing similar declines?
Steve Sanghi: The Asia part of the business, if you look at the last several quarters, June 2005, September 2005, December 2005;, Asian business was up very, very strongly. The March quarter in Asia has a large number of holidays because of Chinese lunar New Year. So our business is down in the March quarter every year seasonally. Asia business will be up very, very healthy in the June quarter. I haven't seen competitors' numbers and certainly even if I read the numbers on a top line basis, I do not dive into how the businesses are doing geographically, I think that's probably your analyst job, but I'm sure they have similar impact on the lunar New Year.
Shailesh Jaitly: Understand. So pretty much seasonal.
Gordon Parnell: Yes, absolutely.
Shailesh Jaitly: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: This question comes from Chris Caso with Friedman, Billings Ramsey.
Chris Caso: Yes, thanks. I wonder if I could just ask about the analog business again a bit. Could you talk a bit about perhaps what you think your competitive advantage is with that business? Obviously there's a lot of capable competitors, what is driving the gains that you guys seeing right now? A high-level look at the business.
Steve Sanghi: Well, I think I can only answer it very, very generically without giving any of the secret sauce away. You know, Microchip has said for many years now that our microcontrollers business is a highly analogous, in fact, well in excess of 80% of our microcontrollers business has very, very strong analog on it. The microcontrollers products are loaded with A2D converters, power management, supervisors, reference voltages, and stuff like that. Microcontrollers is a real-time control unit, while the real world is analog, so whether it's temperature, pressure, motion, motor; anything microcontroller is trying to control, it requires sensing and taking in analog signal, converting it to digital, and then doing whatever you want to do with a microcontroller and then doing something on the output side which is again analog. So Microchip has had substantial analog expertise for a very large number of years. Several years ago we recognized that despite having a large amount of analog in a microcontroller -- by the way, our analog microcontrollers, microcontrollers which have analog in them, is over a $600 million business at Microchip. So we have a large amount of analog expertise. In fact we more analog expertise in our microcontrollers group than in almost outside of it. But over the last few years, we sense that no matter how much analog we embed inside the microcontrollers, there's always a strong presence of standalone analog products around our microcontrollers. And that's driven by the fact that, analogs are so ubiquitous, they're so fragmented, and not every customer wants to use every analog feature inside the microcontrollers. Some want to use it outside, sometimes there are advantages of using the product outside. They can be faster, or lower powered, or they can be multiplex outside while you can multiplex it from inside the Microcontrollers. So seeing all of those trends, Microchip decided to be in the analog business, and we have taken a large amount of analog capability inside the microcontrollers, packaged it standalone, and we have developed large amount of additional analog capability and many of them are best products of its kind. Every year we win a number of awards from various magazines from leadership regarding best this and best that. We've got the best low-powered options in the industry, we've got great converters, and lots of other different products. And we've been telling investors for a number of years that our analog business essentially will compete with a head-on competition with all the other major analog competitors: Maxin, Nenia, ADI, TI and today we're standing up to everybody in winning designs. We got started a few years ago by trying to attach analog to our microcontrollers business because that was the easiest, the customers had name recognition, they understood our products and our initial success came from selling analog around our microcontrollers. But then we went to the phase 2, which was selling analog to any microcontrollers customer whether they used our microcontrollers or they used our competitors' microcontrollers.  If we lose a microcontrollers design to free scale, we want to still be able to win analog. So that was very successful. The phase 3 in the last two years has been basically selling analog to anybody, whether they use a microcontrollers or DSP, or SPG or microprocessor, or any kind of application, and that's the phase we are in. Phase 1, 2, 3 are all applicable, and growth has accelerated. Analog business was up 52% last quarter over the same quarter a year ago. That's the broader answer rather than trying to pin it down what product line is growing, which we are always uncomfortable in signaling.
Chris Caso: Well, I guess it was the December quarter where you started to show double-digit growth in the analog business, and I realize that you've been exiting the handset portion of the analog business for some time. Is there something in particular you could point in the December quarter that would explain the out-performance there, and is it something that you expect to continue over the next several quarters?
Steve Sanghi: Well, we certainly expect the analog business to continue to go very strongly. Remember the handset decline slide, Microchip is a company that doesn't like the handset business. It's a huge volume, low-margin, fast-changing, so we managed the decline of the handset part of the business over the last four to five years, and now it's mid single-digit of our total analog business so it really can't hurt any more. As that happened, you're seeing the real growth of the non-handset business show up, and we think that growth should continue. Over time, you'll have great quarters and good quarters and sometime even not so good quarters. So I can't tell you it's going to grow 17% every quarter, but it's growing more than the overall market growth of Microchip. And I'm guiding 7% growth to the next quarter, I hope to find it conservative, but I can't guarantee that.
Chris Caso: Just final question with regard to the incremental gross margins for the analog business, where your corporate gross margins are right now, the analog business is pretty much in line with that?
Steve Sanghi: I would not want to comment on that. Relative to -- corporate gross margins are 60, that's pretty good -- and analog gross margins are extremely good, but I don't want to tell my competitors exactly what those are.
Chris Caso: Extremely good meaning a little bit higher perhaps?
Steve Sanghi: I just want to leave it at that. Again, I would like to tell the investors and analysts that, to maintain a, 60% gross margin business in a dominant microcontroller-based company which is 80% of our business; just in the last hour you heard the results on Atnal, and you heard the results on Freescale last week or whenever. I want to create a performance that is so far above our similar competitors which requires a level of secrecy that just I'm not willing to break. I cannot afford to take any risk on anybody knowing anything they should not know.
Chris Caso: Okay. Fair enough, thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Thanks.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Next question comes from Jeff Rosenberg with William Blair.
Jeff Rosenberg: Hi, when you look at the competitors you were talking about being down in the Gartner numbers, are they down on a unit basis or is one of the differences a greater decline than ASP versus what you see?
Steve Sanghi: Let me have Ganesh answer that question.
Ganesh Moorthy: The report at this point really does not break down units in ASP, it's only in dollars, so it's the revenue that is reported by the individual companies.
Jeff Rosenberg: I thought usually they give both. Well, the follow-up I was going to ask was on the 16-bit business, are you today only shipping DS Pic? Is that really what's in the market today, or have you started to ship and see revenue from the 24 series?
Steve Sanghi: We have 24x products are in volume, but the contribution is quite small because they basically just went to production.
Jeff Rosenberg: Okay. Would you characterize the initial acceptance of the 24 series any differently than what you saw in the early stages of DS Pic?
Steve Sanghi: It's way too early to tell, way too early to tell. This is the first quarter.
Jeff Rosenberg: I was thinking about it from a design perspective.
Steve Sanghi: It's widely acceptable. Can you comment on this new survey that we just received?
Ganesh Moorthy: It's a survey that's done by ED Times and it's done by a company called CMP. If you look at how they rate 16-bit microcontrollers in the different brands from different companies that come about, Microchip with its 16-bit microcontrollers is the highest rated by design engineers looking to go start new designs with a 16-bit microcontrollers. I don't remember the exact numbers; like 29% or so of the designers are looking to a Microchip solution. The strength of that is 16-bit is not a new market for us, 16-bit is a market we've served for the high-end 8-bit for many, many years. So many of the same customers who we have 8-bit with, are also looking at our 16-bit product line as a natural extension of what we've done already with them.
Steve Sanghi: See, eight or 10 years ago when we were number 12 or number 10 in 8-bit microcontrollers and climbing, we used to get these kind of survey results, the top microcontrollers architecture pick that customers were looking at. It takes years to reach that position because many people are looking at it, but when the rubber meets the road, not everybody designs with it, you lose because of legacy or other things and product line or whatever. But every year our 8-bit microcontroller share grew and the history shows you the results. We're seeing exactly same kind of results coming out in server, in design wins. So, we're very confident that the path we have on 16-bit is a winner.
Jeff Rosenberg: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: This question comes from Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan..
Harsh Kumar: Hey, Steve. First of all, congratulations on a great quarter, great guidance. Most of my questions have been answered. This one question. Flash-based microcontrollers, where do you see them peaking out on a percentage of business? Just any clarity on that?
Steve Sanghi: Percentage of our business or total conversion in the industry?
Harsh Kumar: Your business.
Steve Sanghi: Well, you know all growth of Microchip and microcontrollers is coming from flash-based. We are essentially not doing any products which are not flash-based with the exception of a few ROM-based we have done. In fact, the non-flash-based is declining, so I think I do not know what will be in five or ten years, just going to get high 70s and 80s. and maybe even higher than that.
Harsh Kumar: Got it. Thank you that's helpful.
Operator: This question comes from Eric Gomberg with Thomas Weisel Partners.
Eric Gomberg: Congratulations on a great fiscal year.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Eric Gomberg: Since you don't provide much specificity other than the sequential growth on the 16-bit products, could you maybe give us some metrics or some ways of thinking about how things are coming along in fiscal '07 -- whether it's, you're at 324 customers today, what would be a signal that things have gone well over the course of this fiscal year, or what type of sequential growth would you anticipate throughout the year so that we know that things are progressing as you hope?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I have given that number of customers every quarter in the past. So I have it on a graph. I'd certainly be happy to send it to you. We should continue to see additional number of customers, we have also given the development tools and we should continue to sell, large number of development tools and beyond that, we should be reporting strong sequential growth on 16-bit microcontrollers quarter over quarter. The fourth would be the number of products. We have 45 products in production today, 30 products we are sampling, and out of those 30, almost 20 will be in production by the end of this quarter. If you look at combination of those factors, I think that we are continuing to really make a significant headway in that market.
Gordon Parnell: We guided to 20% potential growth in the June quarter here.
Eric Gomberg: Right. Okay. Question on SG&A. Maybe it's because you did more internal demand creation, but SG&A actually had reverse leverages up fiscal year over fiscal year as a percent of revenue. Do you expect that to trend in line with revenue over the course of fiscal '07, or do you expect to get some SG&A leverage as revenue builds?
Gordon Parnell: I think the key here is what Steve spoke to in terms of the model we have. It's obviously the approach we have taken with our distribution partners relative to wanting to have control of the design creation element of our business. It does mean that there needs to be an investment on our part in highly technical field sales engineers, as well as field application engineers, so we'll continue to invest in that area to grow our business. It's really very important that we're able to drive our customer designs to completion.
Steve Sanghi: Eric, my numbers show fiscal year '05 operating expenses were at 24.1% of business, and fiscal '06 were at 24.2% of business.
Eric Gomberg: I was just asking about SG&A, which was up.
Steve Sanghi: Okay on SG&A clearly we're making significant investments in SG&A because of demand creation and that's why we're growing substantially much, more than the industry if you look at the Gartner report, in a market where everybody has been essentially not giving us the credit that 8-bit can grow. We just recorded numbers which were up, what in microcontrollers year over year?
Gordon Parnell: 19%.
Steve Sanghi: 19%. So those are industry beating results, and I think when you're as profitable as we are, 36.2% of sales as the operating profit, if you do not make the right investments to grow your top line, then I think shame on us.
Gordon Parnell: I think that ends up being the metrics. I mean gross margins were up 275 basis points, and operating expenses are flat, but certainly more investment in the sales and marketing component of our business, not the G&A. It's in the sales and marketing area that drives our design penetration. So the end result is leverage at the operating profit year to year. You can't look for every component of the P&L to have leverage. You have to invest in the future, and part of what we're doing here is investing in the future growth of Microchip with the resources that we're putting in place.
Eric Gomberg: That's fair and clearly it's been paying off. And one last thing, you said your competitors have 50-100% longer lead times right now. Just wondering to any extent if any you think that's benefiting you in terms of potentially bringing you new customers or folks out there who are having problems sourcing from their current supply base.
Steve Sanghi: It does not help you at all in the current quarter because there is no microcontrollers customer who is using someone else's device can simply plug in our part. These are proprietary products with minimum six to nine months design cycle and sometimes longer; up to a year or two year in design prototyping and all of that. So we're getting no effect of somebody's longer lead times in terms of very short-term. But are you winning the customer's heart in terms of they're hurting from other people's lead time, so for the next design they're looking at Microchip, which would have an impact nine months out, a year out in their next design? Sure. That's how you, by doing a better job on a lot of different fronts, sometimes you win a design because a customer is upset with a competitor. Sometimes you win it because, you got a better price, sometimes you win it because you've got better features and sometimes you win it because the customer is now willing to break the legacy because they're very unhappy with the service of somebody else. Again, like I said, when you have these kind of results like we do in a market that's largely flat on 8-bit microcontrollers, we can grow 18-19%. Last quarter over quarter year ago, you need everything possible. And we're taking advantage of everything possible. We are succeeding in a lot of different dimensions.
Eric Gomberg: Thank you.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Operator: Moving on to Tore Svanberg of Piper Jaffray.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, good afternoon, great quarter. I know your development tools can sometimes be a pretty good correlation to the success of your business. Is there a way to maybe quantify that? Quantify that correlation?
Steve Sanghi: There was a correlation many years ago, but if you look at the growth of the total cumulative development tools and you plot the revenue, it was a very good correlation. Now we have 432,000 developing tools in the market, and shipped over the last 13-14 years and around the world and we do not really know how many tools that were shipped several years ago are still being actively used or the tools have been thrown away or the Company went away or the engineer got laid off and the tools got junked out and buying more advanced tools. It's very, very difficult to get a good assessment when you do that correlation. It's just, from time to time, we have tried sampling a couple hundred customers who bought the tool in the last nine months to a year to see where they are in their design cycle to try to do some metrics on where the business is headed, where we are winning, where we are losing. Those metrics are confidential, but the correlation on the total tools is not very good. The tool sales also jumps up and down based on a number of products introduced, especially new architectures introduced, like we introduced a number of 16-bit architectures so a lot of people have to buy tools. It also runs by promotions, when we're doing seminars, tools should be very, very heavy in July, August, September quarter because we do a [Napster's] conference and nearly 1,000 customers come to that conference and a lot of people want to buy tools there. So, you know, it's really I can't do the correlation to the level of granularity in investors looking at which is plus or minus zero essentially.
Tore Svanberg: That's fair. And also on your Foundry strategy going forward becoming 10% of sales, would that ratio also apply for both MCU and analog?
Steve Sanghi: I think I answered that question before by saying we're going to be building a range of products, but we won't really identify for competitive reasons which products we will build because I think it's a question of for the competition, piecing it together. They get one information one day, what products you do, next time they hear, a sub product line, and next time they hear, technology, the next time they hear what the wafer costs at the Foundry might be, and we don't want them to get at really what we can make and what prices and what lithography.
Tore Svanberg: Fair. And then last question. I think you mentioned for fiscal '07 the 8-bit business continuing to grow, driven by some new and emerging applications. Can you give us a couple of examples of those?
Steve Sanghi: Well there're hundreds, I think, about nine months to a year ago we were reporting 46,000 customers; today we have over 50,000 customers, so our business is always thousands of additional customers. Hundreds of additional applications, microcontrollers, it is ubiquitous, it goes into everything. So I couldn't really pick out one or two because our business just is not killer application dependent.
Tore Svanberg: That's fine. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next question comes from Sumit Dhanda with Banc of America Securities.
Sumit Dhanda: A couple of questions. Gordon, could you give us some sense of how distribution resales did in Q1, and how you think that might shape up; if you have any idea in calendar Q1 and calendar Q2?
Gordon Parnell: Well as we indicated distribution performed extremely well in the fourth quarter. You can see that reflected in our deferred margin line where the inventory stocking was up to reflect the fact that sell-through was extremely strong. I think if you look at the geographic elements between Europe, Americas and Asia, you can get a reflection of what was happening from a distribution perspective. As well, Europe and Americas were very strong in the distribution area. We would expect more normal trends based on seasonality and geographical dispersion here in the June quarter from each of the geography.
Sumit Dhanda: Is it fair to say that your deferred income was up about 17% or so and distribution resales were perhaps not quite that number, but close to that and higher than the overall revenue growth you posted in the quarter? Or is that stretching it too far?
Gordon Parnell: The distribution was higher than the overall revenue growth and that's why you're seeing the inventory levels increase to meet the demand that they're seeing.
Sumit Dhanda: Steve, in your prepared comments you mentioned growth in 8-bit controllers driven by new applications. Any particular applications you could highlight which are gaining significant traction in driving your growth?
Steve Sanghi: The same question the gentleman asked before you. Did you hear that?
Sumit Dhanda: I apologize, I've been shuffling back between calls. I'm sorry if I missed that.
Steve Sanghi: The answer I gave to that is there's no single application that drives the growth in our business, We have 50,000 customers, we serve thousands of applications, business is very, very broad-based. Microcontrollers is the most ubiquitous device you can find that goes into everything that has power applied to it and from our broad-based numbers we can't pin out any single application that's driving the growth.
Sumit Dhanda: Okay. Thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi: You're welcome.
Operator: Moving on to Steve Maresca with UBS.
Steve Maresca: yes, this is Steve Maresca for Tom Thornhill. I have a couple of questions. First with regards to your investments in operating expenses, you talked about SG&A in those investments to take more customers direct. With regard to R&D, that's been held fairly flat. With regards to investing into new areas, do you see R&D potentially going up here as a percentage of sales over the next year or so?
Steve Sanghi: It should not go up as a percentage of sales. We can grow in dollars by staying into a model and simply investing the incremental revenue we are creating.
Steve Maresca: Okay. So this $23 million, $24 million we should kind of see that you're going to maintain that level.
Gordon Parnell: 10% of sales.
Steve Sanghi: As percentage of sales we should maintain it, but the number will go up in dollars as the revenue grows.
Steve Maresca: Second question is with regard to your memory business, you don't talk much about that. Should we think about that kind of as a single digit year-over-year growth business, or are you making investments there that perhaps you'll tell us more about?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the memory business is now about 11% or so of our sales, something like  11% to 12% of our sales. And five years ago it was over 30% of our sales. So it is a less strategic component, it's not like we're going away from that business. It is an extremely profitable business, a very good business. However, memory is not as design-end driven business as analog and microcontrollers are. The margins are significantly higher on microcontrollers and analog than on the memory business, but it's a separate division, so it's not like it's competing for resources or anything else. It is introducing its own new products. In the last year it introduced several new products in the area of 512 E-square and megabit E-square-- in fact memory business last quarter was up year-over-year , it was up about what percentage?
Gordon Parnell: I think 9%.
Steve Sanghi: So it was up about 9%.
Gordon Parnell: So it's about 12% to 13% of our business to-date.
Steve Maresca: Okay, thank you.
Steve Sanghi: You're welcome.
Operator: This question comes from Mark Edelstone with Morgan Stanley.
Steve Sanghi: Hi, Mark.
Mark Edelstone: Hi, thanks a lot guys and nice job on the quarter.
Steve Sanghi: Thanks.
Mark Edelstone: You talked about basically expanding the clean room or building out the clean room of fab 4, I assume, to get to $1.7 billion of internal production. Can you talk about what the expected capital spending would be like to get that incremental $300 million of revenues?
Steve Sanghi: The clean room was already built out when we bought it. It's just when we bought the facility, you know, it was not all equipped. It was substantially equipped, but there is a lot of additional clean room available in which we can install equipment. The equipment we have to install in it is not really in one day. It happens over the next five years as we go from here to completing the total build out, facilitization of the fab. Most of the equipment we can buy it really, the used equipment or whatever at a fairly discounted prices over time and the capital required should really fit into our budget of the kind of percentage of sales we are capitalize percentage of sales, which in current year is about 8%. So somewhere in that 8% to10% range we should be able to complete all of that. So there are no extra expenses needed from outside.
Mark Edelstone: Understood. I guess I was just wondering what you thought the capital expense would be like to fill that equipment setup over time.
Steve Sanghi: I probably wouldn't want to give that number, but I think I tell you with an 8% to 10% of sales will be the capital budget for the next several years, and in that is included that equipment probably the best I could do.
Mark Edelstone: Maybe just to think about it differently. What do you see as your maintenance capital spending at this point, just to keep facilities operating at high levels?
Gordon Parnell: It's tough to split it into those areas. Obviously we invest in new capacity, we invest in our assembly and test area, to complement what we already have, but certainly with our business we do have to look at existing equipment, and there's the need to refresh that on occasions, I don't know that I have got a metrics that I could pull out that would have a real historical view over a few years that I would be comfortable with.
Mark Edelstone: Okay, thanks a lot. Just one other question with the end of the fiscal year, Gordon, have you guys taken a cut at revenues by end market?
Gordon Parnell: No, we haven't had a chance to do that as yet.
Mark Edelstone: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
Gordon Parnell: Thanks, Mark.
Operator: Moving on to Craig Ellis from Citigroup.
Terence Whalen: Hi this is Terrence Whalen for Craig Ellis with a quick question related to the distribution versions OEM. Assuming distribution did grow in line with the deferred line of about 17%, it looks like OEM then declined about 15% in revenues. Is that decline of OEM, is that reflective of inventories being worked down or actual patterns of demand?
Gordon Parnell: Those numbers are not accurate. Both OEM and distribution grew. There's some relationship in terms of the deferred margin, which doesn't always cover exactly the unit growth in distribution, so I think that there's data which is peeling the onion two or three levels that you're not able to see from a gross balance sheet perspective, but I can confirm that both OEM and distribution business grew sequentially in the March quarter.
Terence Whalen: Okay. Great, that's helpful. I was looking just at the deferred income line and assuming that revenue would grow.
Gordon Parnell: I understand.
Terence Whalen: My second question is related to distribution inventory but in a different way. You mentioned your distribution is going more direct. Does that mean that we can assume a structurally different level of inventory, maybe say below two months going forward in the channel? Thanks.
Steve Sanghi: What we said is, we are taking more control of demand creation, but I also said in my prepared remarks that a lot of the shipment of that business, fulfillment of that business continues to but through distributors. So we're really not thinking here that there's going to be a dramatic change of OEM versus distribution mix, but the large portion of distributorships, actually a demand is created by Microchip. It's Microchip's engineers and sales guys that really create that demand and then the customer wants to use the distributor as a supply-chain channel.
Terence Whalen: Great, thanks very much.
Operator: That does conclude the question-and-answer session, I'll now turn the conference back over to you.
Gordon Parnell: Thanks very much, Justin. I appreciate it. I appreciate everyone's time on the call this afternoon. I appreciate the questions and the opportunity to respond to those. Steve and I will be around able to answer additional questions as required, thanks, everyone. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2006 Q3  (2006-01-22 15:45:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone, welcome to this Microchip Technology Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2006 Financial Results Conference.  As a reminder today’s call is being recorded.  At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Gordon Parnell, Chief Financial Officer for Microchip, please go ahead sir.
Gordon W. Parnell: Thanks Sarah and good afternoon everyone.  During the course of this conference call we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.  We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.  We refer you to our press release of today as we announce our 10-K for the fiscal year ended 31st 2005, and our 8-K account reports that we have filed with the SEC that are identifying the important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations.  In attendance with me today is Steve Sanghi, Microchip’s President and CEO.  I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2006 performance, giving geographic data and discussing balance sheet and cash information, and Steve will then give his comments on the results as inline with our guidance for the March quarter and update on the pertinent matters regarding our business.  We then both will be available for the specific investor and analyst questions as required. So net sales for the December quarter were at record levels of 234.9 million, up approximately 3.3% from net sales of 227.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up approximately 14.4% from net sales of 205.4 million in the prior year’s third quarter.  Our GAAP net income for the December quarter was at record levels of 70.7 million or $0.33 per diluted share, an increase of 7.7% from GAAP net income of 65.7 million or $0.31 per diluted share from the immediately preceding quarter, and an increase of 33.1% from GAAP net income of 53.1 million or $0.25 per share from the prior year’s third quarter.  Geographically sales in Asia and Americas grew by approximately 7.6% and 1.7% respectively, with Europe 1.8%. Asia achieved revenues of approximately 108.6 million for the quarter, representing about 46% of our total revenues.  Customer designs from both the Americas and Europe continued to be a growing portion of our Asian revenues.  We established record gross margins for the December quarter of 59.7% comprising the proprietary product positioning and rich value-added products that Microchip has in the marketplace, world class manufacturing yields and efficiencies and richer product mix. Our operating expenses were 23.7% of sales in the December quarter, compared to operating expense of 24.3% in the previous period.  Research and development costs were 23.4 million representing 10% of sales.  Sales and general administrative expenses were 32.3 million representing 13.7% of sales.  The tax rate for the December quarter was inline with our guidance of 24%.  The dividend declared today of $0.19 was an increase of approximately 19% sequentially and an increase of 171% over the same quarter in fiscal 2005. Microchip’s total inventory position at the end of December was approximately 114.6 million, an increase of approximately 4.4 million from the prior quarter.  Inventory turns at 3.3 with days of inventory representing 111 days.  Distribution inventory is continuing at very moderate levels in all geographies, and as of the end of December distributors held about two months of inventory.  Given the current industry conditions and the level of inventories at distribution, we are comfortable with the overall level of inventories, which support our business today. At December 31st Microchip receivable days was 47 compared with 48 days at the end of September.  Our overall trade receivable balance decreased approximately 4.8 million or 4%; actually our revenue growth was 3.3%.  At the end of December Microchip’s cash and short-term investment position was 992.4 million with 45.4 million of debt on the balance sheet.  During the quarter, Microchip generated a cash flow from the business of 126 million prior to the dividend payment of 34 million, and 3 million in stock buyback activity. Capital spending was approximately 17.6 million for the December quarter, and depreciation expense for the same period was 26.8 million, 30.2 million for the same quarter last fiscal year, and 27.6 million in the September quarter.  For the full year we anticipate capital expenditures of 60 million and depreciation of $110 million. Two other items I would like to touch on today.  We have indicated in our 10-Q filings the ongoing discussions at the company related to our considering repatriation of earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act.  Under the Act Microchip can repatriate up to $500 million in earnings from the foreign subsidiaries in the US.  While the analysis is not complete at this time and board action has not been confirmed, I want to remind investors of the tax impact should the company decide to repatriate the earnings at a later date. The repatriation would result in a substantial reduction from the approximate $180 million tax expense that would be charged without Act if the company decides to repatriate the maximum permitted a month.  Under the Act we anticipate the additional tax expense would be up, up to approximately $34 million.  The tax expense would be based on the actual amount of cash to the company may elect to repatriate and will be charged in the appropriate fiscal and financial quarter.  Should management decide to do a repatriation, the decision will be effective once the board ratifies the results of management’s analysis and the dividend has to be cleared. And secondarily I want to talk to on relates to the adoption of Option Expensing FAS 123R.  Microchip will adopt FAS 123R for fiscal years beginning April 1st 2006.  Based on investors feedback Microchip’s board has decided to use Restricted Share Units: RSUs as the equity vehicle to incentivize employees.  RSUs will replace stock options as the primary and longer care compensation vehicle at Microchip. Based on our analysis of FAS 123R implementation, we anticipate an earnings impact of 7 to 8% during fiscal 2007.  We will report earnings on a GAAP basis as well as excluding the effects of the stock compensation costs to all of our investors and analysts to understand the effects of the adoption of 123R.  With that I’ll ask Steve to discus the performance of our business, our guidance for March and other matters as necessary.  Steve.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you Gordon and good afternoon everyone.  I would like to apologize to our investors in the east coast for the timing of this call.  It was a crowded calendar today with many companies announcing, therefore we had to chose this time.  I would also like to wish all of our investors and analysts very happy and prosperous New Year.  I hope that we help you make money with 25% appreciation including dividends in 2005 and 131% appreciation over the last 5 years, and we will continue to deliver you incremental value going forward.  Today I would like to reflect on the result of the December quarter, then comment on the product lines, and finally discuss the guidance for the March 2006 quarter, so lets begin. I am extremely pleased with our continuing excellent execution in delivering yet another record quarter in every respect.  We exceeded our guidance in net sales, in gross margin percentage and in earnings per share.  Net sales were $234.9 million, which was an all-time record.  Gross margin of 59.7 was also a record and was up 50 basis points sequentially.  Our operating profit was another record and exceeded 36% for the first time in our history. Earnings per share was $0.33, exceeding our guidance by $0.01 and also it set an another all-time record.  We also produced a record free cash flow of $126 million before a dividend payment of 34 million last quarter.  We are pleased to be increasing the dividend paid to our shareholders by about 19% to a record quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.  Our dividend rate was already at the highest level in the semi-conductor industry and with this increase we continue to further increase the value delivered to our shareholders.  Now I shall talk about the product lines. First Microcontrollers.  Mircocontroller business grew 3.5% sequentially in an otherwise seasonally weak quarter for Microchip.  Microcontroller business was up 12% over a year ago quarter.  Our Flash Microcontroller business was very strong, and grew by a robust 8% sequentially and 38% over a year ago quarter.  Flash Microcontrollers now represent over 55% of our Microcontroller business.  We are continuing to experience strong design activity with our 8-bit Flash microcontrollers and we are seeing a significant number of new application emerging, which are utilizing our products.  We are very well positioned to continue to gain market share in this segment.  I want to thank our shareholders for ignoring the SIA data, number of cars built as well as data points from certain competitors.  The skeptics have been consistently wrong and have done a disservice; this is the first time when I did not see the stock get whipsog because an uninformed someone has something to say.  I ask you to continue to ignore such data in the future as applied to Microchip’s microcontroller business. 16-bit microcontrollers.  Our 16-bit microcontrollers was up 19% sequentially in December quarter, albeit from a small bid.  At the end of last quarter we had 233 customers in production versus 199 in September quarter and 165 in the June quarter.  Based on that metric, the customer penetration is preceding as expected.  We shipped 748 new development tools last quarter for accumulative total of 11,387 development tools supporting our 16-bit products.  Based on the momentum that customers we see we expect 16-bit microcontrollers to be up approximately 15 to 25% sequentially in the March quarter. Putting it further in our cap, our PIC24 16-bit microcontroller architecture won two key awards last quarter.  One award was the Best microcontoller of 2005 by EEPN magazine in the 2005 product review and outlook supplement, and in the second award PIC24 was named Co-winner of one of the 2005 products of the year by Electronic Products magazine. Serial EEPROM memory products.  Serial EEPROM memory products net sales were down 4% sequentially but up 16% over a year ago quarter, pricing remained strong with our average selling price in the quarter, actually up 1% sequentially. Analog products.  Analog products were the sequential growth winners for the quarter.  Analog products net sales were up 18% sequentially and up 40% over a year ago quarter.  We believe that we outgrew nearly all of our analog competitors and are gaining market share in analog.  The design momentum on analog products has been very strong and we see continuing growth ahead.  Our backlog for analog business going into this quarter is quite strong, and we expect a growth of about 4 to 6% in analog, which is much better than typical seasonal pattern for March quarter.  Now I shall discuss our guidance for the March 2006 quarter. As we look at the March quarter we took several factors into account.  Our March quarter is usually a seasonally weak quarter for Microchip but we achieved a record bookings in the December quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04, and the booking so far in January are again at a record pace.  Taking all these factors into account and after checking expectations from our direct as well as distributors channels we expect net sales in the March quarter to be about 242 million, which is a sequential growth of about 3%.  It is much better than seasonal pattern for March, yet it accommodates the expected shutdown during Lunar New Year in most of Asia. Gross margins are expected to be about 59.75% to 60% this quarter.  I remind investors that we increased our long-term gross margin guidance to 62% during last quarter.  Operating profit in March quarter is expected to be about 36 to 36.5% and earnings per share are expected to be about $0.34.  We expect to build approximately 110 million of net cash flow before payment of $40 million of dividends just announced today and we look forward to sharing this cash with investors with another healthy increase in dividends in the next quarter. I also want to briefly talk about the lead-time.  We reported during December that lead times on some of our products was starting to stretch.  We said that on some of our products, the lead-time had gone from 4 weeks to about 6 to 8 weeks.  Now during the quarter, we have been able to balance the mix and bring on additional assembly and test capacity online.  The lead-time on products has not become shorter because of strong demand but the lead-time is not getting any longer either, therefore, we have achieved balance and we continue to watch this situation very carefully. So let me summarize a few key points.  Our net sales are expected to be about $242 million, up 3% sequentially, gross margin to be about 59.75% to 60%, operating expenses to be about 23.5% to 24%, operating profit to be about 36% to 36.5% and earnings per share are expected to be about $0.34.  With that data, would you please pose for questions.
Operator: Thank you, the question and answer session will be conducted electronically.  If you would like to ask a question, please press “*” “1”on your telephone keypad.  Let me remind you if you are using a speakerphone to please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment.  Additionally, please limit yourself to one question due to time constraints.  And we will take our first question from Michael Masdea with CSFB.
Michael Masdea: Well thanks.  Your commentary on lead times was pretty interesting.  Is there a risk that you run that some of the other features of the building materials lead times which seem to be stretching like we heard from Fairchild, from others.  Does that put any pressure on your business or any risk of ordering that you see out there?
Gordon Parnell: I didn’t hear Fairchild, what did they say?
Michael Masdea: Well they said their lead times continue to stretch, and that’s getting tighter basically in the backend utilizations kind of getting tighter etc., its consistent with what on and said on some others, just that we have this environment of expedite orders and threshing lead times etc., lean inventories and the supply chain maybe too lean, does that kind of pressure on the overall potential building materials putting pressure on your business are at risk over or even though your lead times are pretty stable?
Gordon Parnell: Well in some cases we feel what they are feeling, in other cases we are doing a little bit better, we are expediting a lot of product, general inventory is very low, and customer is expediting a lot of product and expedites at all-time high.  So that is really all true, but you know for the last several quarters, we have been seeing that we feel comfortable with our inventories, our total inventories were about 111 days plus distribution is getting about 2 months of inventory, and most of Microchip’s inventories at the at the inventory levels, so we have a healthy stock and we can very quickly put them in the required package and test them according to customer specification.  We also have a very very large assembly and test plant in Thailand; I don’t know which company is purely subcontracting, which companies have their own.  So having its own, having our own we have tremendous ability to be flexible and work overtime and work Sundays, and so we are really doing all that and been able to add some additional capacity as well as require some additional capacity at the subcontractors, so I think we had done an overall pretty good job of managing the lead times so it doesn’t become so long that it is not helpful to our customers.
Michael Masdea: With you doing that, is it a little surprising to you that the numbers didn’t do better in the quarter or I missed a few – what really drove that?
Gordon Parnell: You know many times it’s a matter of choice, you know I think, you know, some of the memory and analog packages are very similar, some of the memory packages are similar to microcontrollers in the low-end and largely we want to ship the highest margin product, for we have given package available, and I also said memory pricing was actually up a percentage point, so our mainly strategy is not one of market shares, its really one of you know managing P&L profitably and in the mircocontroller and analog and both of those areas were gaining market share so I really think we put up many in resources where really we should have put.
Michael Masdea: Okay thanks a lot, makes sense.
Operator: We will take our next question from Adam Parker, Sanford Bernstein.
Adam Parker: Hi, two things.  Gordon, can you at all break down the impact of the options by COGS R&D and SG&A for fiscal ’07?
Gordon Parnell: COGS would be about 20%; the balance would be in operating expense these item.
Adam Parker: So 50-50 between R&D and SG&A?
Gordon Parnell: Probably in that range about 30 to 40% in R&D and the balance is SG&A.
Adam Parker: Okay.  And the other thing is just about analog.  Steve, could you talk at all about some of the successes there when you are winning now, why do you think you are winning, what’s your competition are offering, based why do you feel you are gaining momentum that seems sustainable?
Steve Sanghi: I think as far as it comes on specific products and winning strategies we have really chosen to really not expand on that.  Everybody listens to these calls and you know we really were doing a signal to any competitive where we are winning and why we are winning in either of our product segments.  I think that’s the best position we can take.
Adam Parker: Okay so same as your 8-bit strategy?
Steve Sanghi: And as 16-bit strategy, there is really, you know I think overtime I feel investors and analysts gain not too much from it and make you feel better but you know competition gains the most, so there is no reason really why we should signal to any of our analog competitors in which areas we are gaining, would then go analyze our products and somebody has good market research they know it already, if they don’t then we don’t want to tell them.
Adam Parker: Okay, so one last thing, can you provide a base at all for all the sequential growth numbers you gave in 16-bit, you know 19% of you know?
Steve Sanghi: We can’t, we are providing that on analog and overall microcontrollers and memory, those numbers you have them available, we filed them in our Qs but we are not going to break out 8-bit and 16-bit microcontroller, none of our competitors do and we are not going to do it either.
Adam Parker: Right, thanks guys, good job.
Operator: Moving on to Chris Danely, JP Morgan.
Christopher Danely: Thanks guys, before I ask my question, I am sorry can you just run through the geographic breakout again?
Steve Sanghi: Certainly.
Gordon Parnell: Yeah, geographically Asia was up 7.6%, Americas was up 1.7, and Europe was there in 1.8.
Steve Sanghi: Are you asking in percentage terms or what they out of percentage of revenue?
Adam Parker: I can take that out as a revenue for March quarter.
Steve Sanghi: Okay.
Adam Parker: And then just a follow-on on Parker’s question.  Since you won’t give us the percent of revenue for 16-bit, can you give us a timeline on when it becomes material say in the 5 to 10% range?
Steve Sanghi: No I really can’t do that either because I will be answering the same question in a different way.
Adam Parker: Alright, strike 2.  How about, can you give us your expectations for the different product types for growth in the March quarter, like how much you expect from micros versus analog versus EEPROM?
Steve Sanghi: We provided some of that, I said on 16-bit microcontroller we are expected to grow 15 to 20%, 15 to 25% sequentially in March quarter, and on analog I said we expect it to grow from about 4 to 6% sequentially in the analog and we didn’t break down in the memory and rest of the microcontrollers.
Adam Parker: How much do you expect the overall microcontroller business to grow in Q1 or excuse me in the March quarter?
Steve Sanghi: By 3%.
Adam Parker: Okay thanks guys I am out.
Operator: From Thomas Weisel Partners Eric Gomberg.
Eric Gomberg: Congratulations on a strong quarter.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Eric Gomberg: Could you maybe discuss a little bit more what goes into the decision on going forward with the repatriation and what we’d expect with cash that was brought into US?
Steve Sanghi: Well you know if you look at it, you know very large portion of our expenses are in US, you know our fab here in US, you know most of our R&Ds in US.  In Europe we largely have sales infrastructure, and in Asia we do have manufacturing but you know a lot of the huge demand of expenses and all that development really happens here in US.  So we have very large amount of cash product overseas and many many companies are really doing what we are doing if you look at you know Fairchild and Xilinx and a lot of other companies and if you bring the cash to US, it gives you more flexibility in future overtime to really do whatever you know you wanted to do with it.  This is one-time opportunity which is not available you know after the fiscal year runs out, when you can bring it in where you know one-fifth of or one-sixth of the tax payment compared to the regular tax rate, so this is really kind of a no-brainer in a way.
Eric Gomberg: Okay, just wondering, maybe you give more color on what drove such strong bookings and what typically is a seasonally weaker period, you know kind of reassessing the question of things being tight, and then our people simply concerned that they can’t get enough product right now or you know there is more to it than that?
Steve Sanghi: Well you know all through December quarter as I went to several conferences, what we basically said was if you go back you know 90 days ago the world was looking at the environment extremely negatively with the effects of hurricane and very high oil prices and so on and so forth and with all the interest rate increases and people were you know just calling for a discussion, and you know all of a sudden things improve and in the November-December timeframe, they improve quite a bit, it looks like the end of interest rate was coming, the oil prices came down, the gas prices came down, the effect of Hurricane Katrina essentially the rest of the US, the business activity was strong and so was in the rest of the world.  And everybody was preparing fairly conservatively so some of the lead times starting to go out, and when that happens we always get booking activity because people want to deserve this but on the line.  And now as you look at in the middle of January, it seems like some of the oil prices and others have gone back up but the environment continues to be fairly positive and we are seeing continuing strong bookings and its really no longer driven by lead time changes because lead time is sort of constant but it is not constant at 2 to 3 weeks as it used to be, it’s a little bit longer but you know we are seeing reasonably strong business environment, and we are getting the same thing from others who have been announcing their numbers.
Eric Gomberg: Just a quick housekeeping question, Gordon, maybe you could help in terms of interest income, you had a nice jump this quarter, cash balance obviously keeps going up, interest rates have moved higher, what are we expecting coming quarters?
Gordon Pernell: We had a stronger cash generation in the December quarter, receivables went there quite nicely in a period where obviously revenues grew so that mean we were liquidating receivables quite nicely.  I think if you look at the overall effective interest rate on the growth and then apply it to what we are guiding you to this quarter I think you get close to the same sort of metrics so, you know, after the dividend we expect cash balances to be going up about $70 million, which should translate into another healthy increase in interest income.
Eric Gomberg: Okay thank you.
Operator: Next question from Mark Edelstone from Morgan Stanley
Mark Edelstone: Good afternoon guys.
Steve Sanghi: Go ahead Mark.
Mark Edelstone: Can you hear me?
Steve Sanghi: Yeah you are becoming feeble but we can hear you.
Mark Edelstone: Can you hear me still?
Steve Sanghi: Yes go ahead.
Mark Edelstone: Okay I am sorry, question on turns, what were they in the quarter, and then when you look at the business given the strength that you are seeing in the analog, industry when we look back over the past year or so, is it current profile for that business and difference than what you see in Microcontrollers, guess that the terms would be kind of lower there but so though the overall terms for the company in the quarter then just a profile of the analog business?
Steve Sanghi: Mark you made a call three quarters ago we stopped talking about turn percentage is in turns, it was always confusing, we have always maintained that turns really do not correlate to our business, whether you get the business early on as schedule business prior to the start of the quarter whether your customer gives you the order on 20th of December or 5th of January does not make any difference if the order is being shipped in February.  So we don’t really talk about turns any more.  The second part of your question was…?
Mark Edelstone: How does analog looking in that environment?
Steve Sanghi: You know this would, analog turns are really no different than rest of our business, I think when we look at the various product line, they looked very very similar internally, so there is any missing I can break it out there.
Mark Edelstone: So is there just any additional insight that you can share it here on the recent strength that you are seeing in analog in terms of your geographies or end markets that are driving that growth?
Steve Sanghi: Well, I know the geography, I know the end market, but again if I start to talk about that earlier if we get to the application level and I don’t want to do that because it will really signal which products you know, if you look at in analog we are in 5 different market segments.  We are in power management, we are in thermal management, we are in mixed signal, you know we are in Op Amps, which is called linear products and we are in interface products.  So we are in 5 different product segments, and you know some of the segments we are seeing very very strong strength, we have good leadership position, we have best-in-class products, we have won some product awards and we are getting strong design activity and we don’t want to break out anymore than that, really where we are winning.
Mark Edelstone: Okay thanks.
Steve Sanghi: Most of this upside actually came from US designs and some of them get shipped in US and some of them get shipped in Asia but upside is from US designs.
Operator: Moving on to Cody Acree, Stifel Nicolaus & Company.
Cody Acree: Thanks.  Steve, just going to be following up there on the analog question there, are you seeing more strength attached to microcontrollers as a system or they standalone analog sales?
Steve Sanghi: Well, what I have described in the past is that we had a three strong analog strategy: Phase I, Phase II and Phase III.  Our Phase I was we would be wanting to attach the analog products to our microcontroller products because our main recognition was with microcontroller, that was we could most easily win, and after the acquisition of TelCom 5 years ago, our Phase I was really to maximize the attachment of analog with our microcontroller products.  2 or 3 years ago, we implemented Phase II which was, we wanted to win the analog products with any microcontrollers, so if microcontroller happens to be one of our competitors we still had very good analog products and the signal chain of that microcontroller, and we wanting to compete with better be our product rather than TI’s or Maximedia, Burbrown or somebody else.  And so that was certainly successful because that showed us that these products could stand on their own two feet and compete successfully even in the second where we didn’t have analog.  I am sorry where we didn’t have the microcontroller win, and then the third phase of that was, it was implemented maybe about a year ago is analog anywhere, whether its going in DSE socket, whether its going in a Microprocessor or XPGA or essentially anywhere and everywhere in direct competition with all of our larger analog competitors because we now believe with 500+ products and analogs we have the breadth and the strength in the best-in-class products in many areas where they could stand on their own two feet and compete with anybody.  So right not all three phases are applicable, we essentially go anywhere analog could win and we no longer restricted by taking analog around the microcontroller so therefore we are winning everywhere.
Cody Acree: Steve, thanks for the detail on that.  On your guidance somewhat above a seasonal norm, you mentioned, it was mentioned earlier that some of the others in the industry were so tight, are you simply saying that the industry is above seasonal norms at this point, do you think you are benefiting from some market share gains here maybe helping to add to that?
Steve Sanghi: I don’t really know how to break it out because I only know what everybody else is feeling in terms of their growth and why their growth is coming or whether their growth is being restricted by tightness or whatever, so I do not really know.  What we are seeing is March quarter usually is a very very weak quarter for Microchip and we are seeing not as weak quarter, as we talk to our customers in Asia.  And March quarter is by the weak primarily because of Asia, primarily because of the Chinese New Year, the Lunar New Year.  There are more than factors, I mean that’s really why it is weak, its 46% of our business today and in 46% of our business, it takes a couple of weeks off in the middle of February, there is just almost no way to recover from that historically.  As we look at it now and talk to our customers, most customers are talking about very abbreviated shutdown schedule for the Chinese New Year, not as long as it has been many times in the past because lot of the end customers are around the world in US, in Europe and they no longer afford to shutdown their factories for two weeks because their product demand.  What we are seeing and we are essentially you know working hard to make all the product available with reasonable lead times to take advantage of that.  In our business you can’t really win very short-term market share from somebody unless you know you won that design 6 months 9 months a year ago.  So its just somebody else can’t supply the product in the month of February and I happen to have the product available, I am not likely to win market share, I am only likely to win if I won that market share 9 months in the design.
Cody Acree: Great, thanks Steve.
Operator: And the next question is from Christopher Caso with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.
Christopher Caso: Hi guys, thank you, nice quarter.
Gordon Parnell: Thank you.
Christopher Caso: Just if you guys could talk a little bit, when you set your longer term margin targets, you were talking about some tradeoffs that you were evaluating between you know perhaps seeing little more aggressive in the migration of Flash versus you know bringing the margins higher.  Is that one of the factors that moving a little better than seasonal now, or you know maybe you could talk about, you know if you are taking that a more aggressive posture, when we might see the effects of that on the topline?
Steve Sanghi: I don’t see the effects of all that could be so short-term because its really again on the proprietary product has to go to the design sales where you are willing to bid more aggressively in the design because you have healthy margin and you have a cushion beyond that.  So really what you are seeing in the December quarter and March quarter really has nothing to do with that.  You know that effective probably a year out.  If you look at our last quarter and analyze it, you will see a 75% incremental gross margin, which is a strict calculation, incremental gross margin divided by the incremental sales quarter-over-quarter, so while our company GAAP gross margin was 59.7% the incremental gross margin was 75% so this is where it tells you that as sales grow that is still margin leverage and growing the margin overall.
Christopher Caso: And I guess would you guys looking forward over the next couple of quarters, would you assume that you would remain in that sort of 75 incremental gross margin level in that couple of quarters?
Gordon Parnell: It’s hard to pin down because too many moving parts and expedites, non-expedites and packages and naxtites (Ph) and in the large volume business, I haven’t really monitored the graph as well of incremental gross margin overtime.  And depends on when you run into the capacity end, then you add incremental capitals and that has to depreciate which lowers the incremental gross margin from that kind of numbers.  So that one, incremental gross margin is not bad, perfectly linear, you know as the gross margin seems to be, so I can’t answer that it is going to stay at that level.
Christopher Caso: Okay so just one more, I will go away.  Regarding the depreciation guidance you guys provided, it sounds like it is going down on a year-over-year basis, and if you just clarify the depreciation guidance you gave that was for fiscal ’07?
Gordon Parnell: No, the 110 was for the current fiscal year.
Christopher Caso: For the current fiscal year, okay.
Steve Sanghi: Yeah, yeah.
Christopher Caso: Do you have a number for next year?
Gordon Parnell: No I don’t have a number for next year on that, its top off of my head.
Christopher Caso: It should be lower, right?
Steve Sanghi: Yeah.
Christopher Caso: Because some other depreciation rolling off, which is going to be 7 depreciation should be lower than fiscal year ’06.
Gordon Parnell: Yeah and it can also depend on growth rates and recapitalization and particular in assembly and test, so there is some living parts that are kind of effective too.
Christopher Caso: Okay great thank you.
Gordon Parnell: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Piper Jaffray.
Tore Svanberg: Yes good afternoon, can you share with us where you are on the utilization rates, perhaps at this point?
Gordon Parnell: Well you know, this strategy at Microchip, we always run at nearly 100% utilization, we don’t’ really build a large factory and then start depreciating it and then really try to find products to fill in.  So our Fab 1 and I am sorry, our Fab 2 is earning nearly 100% the utilization, Fab 4 for the equipment that is installed and turned on and being depreciated, the utilization is nearly 100%.  Having said that, there is a large amount of additional equipment available in Fab 4, which we acquired with the Fab when we brought it from Fujitsu, which can be turned on with a, you know, fairly short notice and tuned up and ready to go, so if I look at the utilization, looking at that equipment as a factor, and we have said before that we have capacity in Fab 4 to take the overall Microchip revenue into about $1.4 billion compared to where we have best in last quarter so you can forget out the utilization.
Tore Svanberg: Great, very helpful, and then also on inventories, your internal is 111, distributors 2 months, would you classify that as a regular level or do you view that as low and if so, could it go lower?
Steve Sanghi: Well the distributor and inventory is basically as low as it is our guidance, I think the lowest may have been 1.9 or something for the month or so but you know two months of inventory is pretty low.  Historically it has been closer to 2.7 to 3 months.  However, the change in this inventory and distribution from closer to 3 months and to two months does not seem temporary, it seems like its more permanent type with distributors through cycles of learning and supply chain solutions have really worked out a way to deal with lower assets trying to improve their own return on assets.  So as distributors keeping a lower amount of inventory from historical levels, it basically requires Microchip now to keep slightly higher inventory from the historical levels, so the lead times can go out and we still will be able to serve our customers.  If you look at Microchip inventory, the lowest ever it has been during 2000 boom was about 74 days, and the highest it ever was I think about 135 days.  So you know at 100 and 110 right now we feel that inventory is basically right.  We are not trying to take it higher, we are not trying to take it lower.  If distributors were to stock up a little bit more and our inventory were to get down a little bit closer to 100, probably would be a better mix but you know I don’t’ think that’s going to happen short-term.
Tore Svanberg: Great, and then just finally on your analog business, you’ve mentioned the 5 product categories, data converter was one of them, is that because that’s on the mixed single interface or you are just not doing data converters?
Steve Sanghi: No, we are in the data converter business.  People have different names for these titles but yeah we make A to Ds, D to As, we make Op Amps, yeah we make all those products.
Tore Svanberg: Great, and congratulations on all the record metric.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you, thanks Tory.
Operator: If you find your question has been answered you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing the pound key, and we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question.  Next question from Shawn Slayton at SG Cowen
Shawn Slayton: Hi guys, nice results.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Shawn Slayton: Maybe Gordon that about the business segments, Steve, can we talk a little bit about the end markets, can you share with us what end markets are showing you know perhaps relative strengths to fuel the momentum here in January?
Steve Sanghi: Well you know as we have always answered this question with 46,000 customers worldwide and so many of them buying through distribution, you know Top 10 customers making up less than 10% of our business, we don’t really have any end market commentary.  We don’t really, we can’t distinguish you know we don’t have huge customers that are 10, 20, 30% of our business, we can distinguish strength of one market versus the other.  You know an average customer that Microchip buys $20,000 to $30,000 a quarter, you know, over that many customers, so we do not have any commentary, we will reiterate the same numbers we gave, the consumers is about 34% of our business, automotive is approximately 18% of our business, office automation and Industrial at about 16 to 17% EH and the communication is about 13, and these numbers over several years have been moved by more than a percent or so.
Shawn Slayton: Okay, let me move on to this, the Flash MCU, can you explain this, you know what’s the dynamic related to migrating existing customers to Flash from maybe OTP type products, and is that a strategy that’s benefiting your business strengths?
Steve Sanghi: This strategy is absolutely benefiting our business, you know approximately 62% of our business by our estimates in 8-bit microcontrollers still non-programmable, which is a ROM-based microcontroller.  ROM-based microcontrollers have to be programmed in the factory where the customer gives the factory a code, then you burn the mask with that code and then you apply the mask in the fab, and that really produce the product for the customer, completely custom as the core changes you can’t use that product if customer’s end product is unsuccessful, customer ordered 100,000 products and he is not able to sell his end product, only able to sell 30 or 40, then all those ROM microcontroller are wasted.  So there has been a long-term trend which has driven the ROM memory to EEPROM then Flash, from our ACIT products to SPGAs, ROM-based microcontrollers to field programmable microcontrollers so that’s one long chain that has been going on for 10, 15, 20 years.  On top of that, you know, Microchip was originally the leader in field programmable microcontrollers by using the EEPROM technology, which was one-time programmable, and in 1996 or something we made the first Flash microcontroller, maybe you know slightly prior to that in the industry, and now 55% of our business is Flash microcontrollers and much of that has come from converting the ROM-based microcontrollers the competitors do out Flash and some of that has happened by converting our own one-time programmable EEPROM based microcontrollers to Flash.  The benefit of Flash is it can be programmed multiple times if you make an error you can recover from it, it can also be programmed in the bold, it can be reprogrammed on a modem, it can be reprogrammed remotely.  So you have much more benefits like any Flash memory would have, it is electrically erasable and programmable.
Shawn Slayton: I guess how does the Microchip salesman incentivize the customer to migrate to Flash?
Steve Sanghi: That I don’t want to share with you for competitive reasons.
Shawn Slayton: Okay, thanks very much.
Steve Sanghi: Welcome.
Operator: We will take our next question from Brandy Brennan with Bam.
Brandy Brennan: Steve, could you talk a little bit about the dsPIC independently or is that all there’s been the 16-bit standard?
Steve Sanghi: Well, the revenue we have today is all dsPICs.  The 16-bit microcontroller which is a PIC24 architecture was announced to the world I think in October-November timeframe, and so it’s really largely in the designing stage and there maybe some small development tool revenue but its product revenue is zero, so all the revenue we have today is dsPIC.  However, going forward as a PIC24 starts to shift, PIC24 actually has a larger market and the dsPIC would be partly much more cost effective and it’s a pure microcontroller, so eventually it will get intermingled and we wouldn’t break those two out.
Brandy Brennan: Okay thank you, also just to comment on the 6:00 o’clock time is fine.
Steve Sanghi: Okay I appreciate, thank you we appreciate it.
Brandy Brennan: Bye thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Sumit Dhanda with Banc of America Securities.
Sumit Dhanda: Hi guys, nicely done.  Couple of quick questions.  First, Steve, it seems like last quarter and then again based on the outlook for this quarter, the 16-bit business really seems to be picking up some momentum, can we, I know you are not giving out the base from where the revenue is growing but can we think about roughly similar sequential growth numbers on a more sustained basis over the next few quarters for this business?
Steve Sanghi: Well you know the customer base is in hundreds rather than tens of thousands, so it’s harder to really give much longer-term guidance whether you can model that going forward.  If you look at it in September quarter, actually the growth was zero, and December quarter it was 19% and we are guiding 15 to 25 going forward, so its really it can be fairly volatile in the early stages and because of the small revenue there, so its really much more difficult to tell you, you know to really model it for an extended period of time
Sumit Dhanda: Okay, my question is on your Flash microcontroller business, I mean is there anything special you are doing, I understand the rationale for migration in your customer base but what makes it difficult for your customers to replicate the strategy that you have in terms of incentivizing your customers and migrate to Flash business?
Steve Sanghi: Customers or the competitors.
Sumit Dhanda: I mean how come the competitors can’t replicate this, is there something special that you are doing that you could share with us or not?
Steve Sanghi: No I mean because and they will know it too, I think you should probably ask them that question.
Sumit Dhanda: Okay, and one final question for you Gordon, the deferred income line was down very substantially, that reflected a reduction in inventory to distributors or is there something else, or am I reading too much of it?
Gordon Pernell: On the deferred income and the balance sheet?
Sumit Dhanda: Yeah deferred income and the balance sheet.
Gordon Pernell: Yeah I think it was guidance, you know modest base, they were both the same number of months of inventory overall, so we spent about $4 million over also really just some mixed aspects there that tends to be in Europe as you saw in the results there, business is more driven from via distribution complement and so that’s reflective and inventory held in all geographies but that certainly won’t had an impact there.
Sumit Dhanda: Okay thank you very much.
Gordon Pernell: You are welcome.
Operator: From Merrill Lynch Joseph Osha.
Joseph Osha: Hi folks congratulations, Steve a longer-term question as I have looked at your market share in the 8-bit business and so it kind of has picked up pretty regularly, a percentage point or so each year.  As I look at 16-bit, should I sort of think about that in the same way, it kind of steam ahead and take a point or so each year or is there some maybe near-term discontinuity because it’s a newer business for you?
Steve Sanghi: Well you know if we can do what we did on 8-bit, I mean that would be our dream, and that’s really what we want to accomplish, from you know starting from where we are right now whether it goes out that rate or it goes slower it goes faster, its kind of very very hard to say, you know it’s really pretty hard to say, and I don’t think I could model this with a certain percentage growth in market share for a year for an extended period of time from where we are today and we are really on the first or second whole year.
Joseph Osha: Okay that’s fine, second question, and I don’t know if this is for you or for Gordon.  As we look at the dividend, and by the way I hope your competitors are listening to the call, and how should we think about the payout ratio or how do you get that number overtime that as you continue to generate operating cash flow?
Steve Sanghi: Well you know we have internally talked about payout ratios but we are not comfortable with the concept of payout ratio yet because as you see we have a way to go in terms of increasing the dividend.  Once we start to reach a number equal to that payout ratio internally, you know then we can talk about staying in that number and increasing it maybe less frequently, you know while we have been doing it every quarter, and really trying to you know take it to a payout ratio.  Right now Board is very comfortable whether to continue to aggressively share the cash with the shareholders because we still have you know current quarter can well go over $1 billion in cash.
Joseph Osha: Yeah, I think is great, and then the last question, I guess for you Gordon, can you just update us on what your philosophy is in terms of where you know operating expenses should come in relative to revenues here, you know target over the next couple of years, and if I can ask you to include the impact of options compensation in that number?
Gordon Pernell: Of course that’s going to obviously change the targets in terms of the longer-term goals, you know, we have said that getting into the range of 24 to 25 points excluding the effects of option expensing is where we see our longer-term goals as we continue to invest in technical resources and our sales and marketing organizations we continue to have field application engineers that are appropriate advocates for our product and microcontrollers and analog as well as having the ability to continue to have design activities and process technologies to support the products as we enter the market, those are sort of the levels that we would expect and as I said of the increase of 7 to 8% in terms of the overall effect of 123R, 80% of that would reside in the operating expenses with 20% being in the COGS area.
Joseph Osha: Alright, thank you very much.
Gordon Pernell: You are welcome.
Operator: From William Blair & Co., Jeff Rosenberg.
Gordon Pernell: Hello Jeff
Jeff Rosenberg: Hi how are you?  I want to follow-up on the last question about operating expenses, I think going back a couple of quarters, you would expect it to be spending more on operating expenses whether it was R&D or marketing resource that it drive demand and it doesn’t seem like that’s comes through, has there been some offsetting cost reductions or reasons you have any other resources you originally expected to?
Gordon Pernell: Well you know several moving parts, you know the industry is pretty tight, employment picture is pretty full, so we have lot of jobs open, we are trying to hire people and its taking longer to get people on board today then it would have taken 6 months ago.  We are hiring people around the world, we have large number of jobs open, and we are getting increased employment, we have people but really it’s taking longer to hire people than we thought six months ago.
Jeff Rosenberg: Okay, and then another follow-up on the question asked earlier about our strategy to perhaps be more aggressive in terms of driving cost reductions to generate demand in the gross margin line, you’ve said its not having a short-term impact and I know there is a lot of moving pieces longer-term but just isolating that, have you been doing them more and do you feel like that’s been driving design wins and should we think about a slower trajectory in gross margin improvement, other things being equal over the next year or so than we have seen in recent quarters?
Gordon Pernell: Well I mean we have basically given you the gross margin trajectory, you know we said a quarter ago that it takes about 2 to 3 years to get to 62%, and when we guided it we had about you know 250 basis points to go and there were 10 quarters, so the trajectory on a field map is about 25 basis point per quarter.  You know and then the numbers always deviate because there is too many moving parts, so we have already modeled that trajectory by which we can see gross margin can improve, after accounting for you know what we are doing in pricing and all that, and yes we are winning more design, yes it is helping.  In answering your prior question I wanted to add, you know one more point on the expense side of the equation that if you just go back about 4 months ago, I earlier mentioned in the call that the whole industry was very negative on the prospects of our industry, driven by all these negative things that were happening, the oil the gold, Hurricane Katrina and so on and so forth, you know our revenue estimates internally were much more conservative.  We were prepared if the session were to come in or whatever, so we don’t want to have expenses to get ahead to the current growth levels we are achieving so we are actually done better in revenue, you know we have just guided you the 3% sequential growth, which is significantly higher, you look at your own estimates, not you, just one person but consensus I think its, you know, revenue guidance is about 6, 7, or $8 million higher than what the March quarter consensus guidance is out there.  So as a result when you apply, you divide by a larger a denominator of` revenue, the operating expenses as a percentage of revenue look lower than they would have if the revenue wasn’t as high.
Jeff Rosenberg: Okay that helps thanks.
Operator: We will take our next question from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski: Hi, thank you very much, if I understand it correctly, it sounds like your industry distributors was down a little bit, and I just wanted to find it if what was behind that, was there retails being higher or your shipments being a combination of the two?
Gordon Pernell: Well, no inventories at the end of the day, Simona, we are largely inline about two months of inventory.  I want just a change in the balance sheet but that’s not really material in the overall picture, two we worldwide basis, they were about at the same range in our Q months.
Simona Jankowski: Got it, so your shipments are pretty well tracking the retail it sounds like?
Steve Sanghi: Yeah I think Simona, I think to recall for a few quarters you have tried to correlate distribution inventories to you know projected strength or softness on the business.  And I think it would help if you give us that correlation because distribution is trying to improve their assets, the return on their inventory, and that’s phenomena of lower distribution inventory has been happening for several years now.  And I wouldn’t be surprised of distribution inventory over the next couple of year, find its way from two months to 1.8 months or 1.9 or 1.7, and we are keeping a higher level of inventory and distribution often is expediting Microchip because they didn’t have the right product and the shelf when they needed and sometime we are able to charge an expedite charge, sometime not, that kind of goes, there is a negotiation, but really trying to correlate the amount of distribution inventory on really what’s happening in terms of resale, I believe that correlation is not good, and it would help if you really not think that way at least for our business.
Simona Jankowski: Yeah, actually I was trying to get more kind of the end demand picture, but I just kind of commentary interesting kind of the structural changes for distribution and that’s very helpful.  Then just quickly on the modeling side, Gordon, are you able to provide us with the after-tax DSO expense number for the quarter?
Gordon Pernell: After the option expensing?
Simona Jankowski: Yeah for the option expensing.
Gordon Pernell: We don’t have the option expensing currently, we will only implement that in April.
Simona Jankowski: Oh I know, jus the number that you would normally dispose in the 10-Q based on broad shoulder assumptions etc, is that available yet or should we just look for the Q for that?
Gordon Pernell: We are also waiting for the Q for that.
Simona Jankowski: Okay I got it, thank you very much.
Steve Sanghi: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Tom Thornhill of UBS.
Tom Thornhill: I had a question on your forward gross margin goals, Steve, do you expect the achievement of these goals to largely be efficiency improvements and pricing or mix improvements in each of the individual sectors, one-time programmable Flash analog or is there some margin difference between the sectors IEM was higher perhaps that the mixed shift in the business would help facilitate achieving these margin goals?
Steve Sanghi: I think you know there are lot of moving parts and we can’t think like you know we have about 225, 230 basis point improvement left in margin to our longer-term guidance of 62%.  Its really hard to break it out by several elements, but I could tell you several element, one big portion of that is you know the increasing utilization in Fab 4 where we have large amount of incremental capacity and as with the revenue grows that capacity goes to work, the incremental cost much lower, so incremental gross margin is much higher, that’s a big piece.  The second piece is the equipment depreciation is rolling off, you know a lot of the equipment we added 5 to 7 years ago in our factories, you know is rolling off equipment depreciation so there is no more depreciation on it going forward, and we will continue to use that equipment because you know Microchip is not a Moore’s law company, and you know we continue to use older processes, older equipment for an extended period of time.  We are still using equipment, I went to production 10 years ago, so there is an element that improves gross margin because of that, and the third element is what you pointed towards were you know product mixes, analog has higher margin, Flash has higher margin, things and lots of these moving parts and last quarter if you look at memory business was down and on the other businesses were up, so its continuously richening mix by various elements more analog more analog microcontrollers, more standalone analog, more mixing, more Flash microcontrollers, more this more that.  So all these elements then its very hard to take 230 basis points kind of number and break it out much more than that into pieces.
Tom Thornhill: Thank you very much, that helps.
Steve Sanghi: You are welcome.
Operator: Next question is from Chris Danely, JP Morgan.
Christopher Danely: Thanks guys, just two quick follow-ups, Gordon I think you mentioned that, you thought that fiscal ’07 depreciation will be down, does that mean you expect fiscal ’07 CapEx to be down?
Gordon Pernell: No the depreciation that I reported, the 110 was for the currency alright, I don’t have on ’07 number yet to share.
Christopher Danely: Do you guys what’s the direction it would be versus ’07 up or down?
Gordon Pernell: It would be flat to down.
Christopher Danely: Okay great, and then second one on the lead times, you know it sounds like you have done a good job of wrapping capacity a little bit and getting those under controlled.  Is your plan to maintain those extended lead times or would you work to bring them down a little bit?
Steve Sanghi: Well you know lead time is basically assumption of demand versus capacity, we work hard everyday to bring those lead time back down because that will be better service to our customers, however, demand continues to be strong, so we are really, we can’t, as long as they are stable I think it is okay but overtime we will bring those down, yes.
Christopher Danely: Exactly, so maybe you can get a handle on that in the June quarter or something like that?
Steve Sanghi: Well you know June quarter is after March, June and September quarter is other two traditionally stronger quarters for Microchip so we are staring into actually two stronger quarters after this quarter.  So I don’t really know as the lead times come down giving us stronger quarters.
Christopher Danely: Got it, okay thanks.
Operator: That is all the time we have to take questions, now I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional closing comments.
Gordon W. Parnell: Thanks Sarah, I appreciate everyone’s bearing with us this evening and I know it’s a very long earnings season for everyone, so we will be available here for any additional question and we look forward to seeing you at conferences or in your offices during this eve, thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you, and that concludes today’s Microchip Technology’s conference, we thank you all for joining us.
