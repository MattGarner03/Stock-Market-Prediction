===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 11:18:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's first quarter 2025 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer and Head of MetLife Investment Management. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter as well as the risk transfer transaction we also announced yesterday. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features additional disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which will end promptly at the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. A few months ago, we rolled out our New Frontier strategy to guide MetLife over the course of the next five years. As you will recall, a keystone of our New Frontier strategy is the all-weather nature of our market-leading set of businesses. And once again, after powering through the supply and mortality challenges of COVID, and then bank liquidity concerns, we find our strategic diversification put to the test. As we move through 2025 with the odds of a recession on the rise, we are seeing unprecedented volatility in the daily trading of the U.S. equity markets. We are also seeing interest rates rise on the long end of the curve, fall in the middle, but Fed funds still remain high at the short end. Meanwhile, after a historic run of strengthening, the U.S. dollar has started to weaken against many currencies around the world. Although MetLife is not immune to the impacts presented by this uncertain backdrop, we are confident we have the right businesses and the right strategy to meet the moment. At our core, MetLife is a recurring revenue business model. In any given year, the vast majority of the revenues and earnings we generate are a function of renewal premium or investment income from assets and liabilities that are already on our books. While the slowing economy can dampen growth for our group benefits business, we've not yet seen cracks in the job market. Further, the primary profit driver mortality for our largest group product line, Group Life, is largely uncorrelated to the economy. For our Retirement and Income Solutions business and our Investment Management business, higher long-term interest rates are helpful on the demand side. The underlying growth of our international businesses, which has been partly masked by the strong dollar could start to emerge as a tailwind. And standing behind it all, our investment portfolio has been risk off for several years and is well situated to absorb recessionary stress. Our positive track record on this front is well established. Over the course of our 157-year history, we have seen challenging times before and has succeeded in driving long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders, and we are well positioned to do so again. Let me now turn to our first quarter results, which we reported last night. I believe they reflect the resilience of our business model and underscore many of the points I just made. We reported adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion or $1.96 per share, up 7% from the same period a year ago. We saw favorable underwriting, good volume growth and better variable investment income in the quarter which were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and recurring interest margins. Variable investment income was aided by the performance of our real estate funds, which continued their steady recovery. Private equity funds gained 1.6% in the quarter, which is below our implied quarterly outlook return. Our adjusted return on equity in the first quarter was 14.4% and our 12% direct expense ratio is evidence of our efficiency mindset at work. Shifting to business segment results. Our Group Benefits business reported adjusted earnings of $367 million, up 29% from the prior year period on favorable life underwriting margins due to lower mortality. We continue to see favorable mortality for the working age population, which is consistent with CDC data. Moving to Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $401 million in the quarter. Sales of synthetic GICs and UK longevity reinsurance were strong in the quarter and inflows associated with pension risk transfers totaled 1.8 billion, an outstanding start for the year. Our liability exposures are up 8% from a year ago. Looking to Asia, adjusted earnings were $374 million, down 12% over the same period a year ago on lower underwriting margins and higher taxes. Sales for the region were up 10% on strong volume growth in Korea and China. Sales in Japan have started to turn the corner, and we are seeing very good energy around a new U.S. dollar-denominated product that we introduced in the banca channel at the end of the first quarter. Turning to Latin America. Adjusted earnings were $218 million, down 6% from the year ago period, though foreign exchange rates played a role. On a constant currency basis, our adjusted earnings were up 7% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted PFOs in the region tell a similar story, up 1% on a reported basis but up 14% on a constant currency basis. Overall, we continue to see strong momentum across our leading markets in Latin America. Since launching our New Frontier strategy in December, we have been laser-focused executing on its key pillars and we are already making meaningful progress. I'd like to expand by providing two related proof points. We were pleased to announce last night another significant risk transfer deal, particularly given the current economic landscape. We have entered into an agreement with Talcott Resolution Life insurance company to reinsure approximately $10 billion of U.S. retail variable annuity and rider reserves. Consistent with our long-term objectives, the planned transaction will accelerate the runoff of MetLife's legacy business, positively reduce the company's enterprise risk and substantially lower the company's retail variable annuity tail risk. For its part, MetLife Investment Management is on an aspirational path to $1 trillion in total assets under management. We have integrated the teams from Mesirow that we acquired in the quarter, and we are working at pace to close our roughly 100 billion AUM acquisition of PineBridge, a substantial down payment towards achieving our aspiration for men. Turning to capital and cash. In the first quarter, we accelerated our capital management activity returning around $1.8 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases. We paid common stock dividends of roughly $400 million and repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of our common shares. The above-average buyback pace was a function of fewer repurchases in the fourth quarter as we were locked out of the market due to pending announcements. We expect subsequent quarters this year to be at a more measured pace. Following our new $3 billion repurchase authorization that was announced last night, our total Board authorization is now about $3.4 billion. In recognition of our financial strength and flexibility, our Board of Directors increased our common dividend per share by 4.1% last week. And further adding to our financial flexibility, we were active in the debt capital markets in the first quarter, issuing $1.25 billion of pre-capitalized trust securities as well as $1 billion of subordinated debt. We ended the quarter with $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. Shifting to governance. We announced in February that Christian Mumenthaler will be joining our Board of Directors effective May 1. Prior to joining our Board, Christian had a distinguished career at Swiss Re culminating in an eight-year term as Group Chief Executive Officer. We are glad to have someone with his skill set and experience on our board as we drive our new Frontier strategy forward. In closing, the underlying fundamentals of our portfolio of businesses remain strong, as evidenced by our solid first quarter performance. While the operating environment may present challenges, we have emerged stronger from prior periods of turmoil. We've done this by following a playbook that focuses on the levers we control like discretionary expenses without sacrificing investments in strategic growth initiatives. When we set our new frontier goals, we were under no delusion that it would be easy. One of the things that gives me confidence in our ability to succeed is the team here at MetLife. For the third year in a row, we are proud to have been named among the 100 best companies to work for by Fortune. Our team is energized and engaged. That leaves me convinced that our people are up to the task at hand, driven and motivated to deliver MetLife's superior value proposition of responsible growth, attractive returns and lower risk. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our quarterly performance in more detail.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. I'll refer to the 1Q '25 supplemental slides, which covers highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital position. We have also included a few slides summarizing our variable annuity reinsurance transaction announced yesterday. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. We had net derivative gains, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen and the Chilean peso versus the U.S. dollar as well as unfavourable equity markets. That said, derivative gains were mostly offset by market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement losses due to lower interest rates and weaker markets in 1Q of '25. In addition, net investment losses were largely the result of normal trading activity on the portfolio and credit remained stable. On Page 4, you can see the first quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment and Corporate and Other. Adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, up 1% and up 5% on a constant currency basis, while foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in the current quarter, most major currencies weakened year-over-year. The positive year-over-year drivers were favorable life underwriting, higher variable investment income and solid volume growth across most business segments. These were partially offset by lower recurring interest margins. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.96, up 7% and up 11% on a constant currency basis aided by strong free cash flow and robust capital management over the prior four quarters. Moving to the businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $367 million, up 29% from the prior year quarter. The key driver was favorable life underwriting margins due to working age mortality improvement compared to the prior year period. The Group Life mortality ratio was 84.8% for the quarter which is at the bottom end of our 2025 target range of 84% to 89% and better than the winter flu season expectations. We continue to see post-COVID favorable mortality trends in the working age population, consistent with CDC data. The non-medical health interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 74.1%, slightly above our target range of 69% to 74%. Dental utilization is seasonally highest in the first quarter, and we expect the ratio to be toward the middle of the target range in Q2. Turning to the top line. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 2% year-over-year. While mortality improvement was favorable to Group Benefits bottom line, it masks top line growth due to the impact on premiums for participating life contracts, which can fluctuate with claims experience but has a limited impact to earnings for those contracts. RIS adjusted earnings were $401 million, up 1% year-over-year. The primary drivers were higher variable investment income and favorable underwriting performance partially offset by unfavourable recurring interest margins. RIS total investment spreads were 114 basis points, up two basis points sequentially due to higher VII. RIS continues to achieve strong business momentum. Adjusted PFOs were $2.4 billion, primarily driven by strong U.S. PRT sales in the quarter, which resulted in new inflows of $1.8 billion in Q1 of '25. Excluding PRTs, RIS adjusted PFOs were up 14%, primarily driven by continued growth in U.K. longevity reinsurance as demonstrated by one jumbo case sold in the quarter with a contract value of $1 billion. In addition, total liability exposure grew 8% versus the prior year period, most notably up 7% in general account liabilities. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $374 million, down 12% and down 9% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to less favorable underwriting margins and an adjustment of a deferred tax asset to reflect an increase in Japan's effective tax rate. This reduced Asia's adjusted earnings by approximately $15 million in the quarter. This was partially offset by higher VII year-over-year. Asia's key growth metrics remain healthy. General account assets under management at amortized cost was up 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 10% on a constant currency basis. While Japan sales were down 8% as foreign currency products remain under pressure given ongoing yen volatility. Other Asia sales were up 41% on a constant currency basis, most notably with strong growth in Korea and China. Latin America adjusted earnings were $218 million, down 6%, but up 7% on a constant currency basis primarily due to higher volume growth across the region and favorable tax items in the quarter. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins as well as lower Chilean encaje returns compared to a strong Q1 '24. Latin America's top line continues to perform well, although reported growth rates are being masked by currency headwinds, most notably due to the weakness in the Mexican peso year-over-year. Adjusted PFOs were up 1%, but up 14% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth and solid persistency across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $83 million, up 8% and up 14% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by solid volume growth, partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 8% and up 12% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong sales across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $154 million, down 3% due to the runoff of the business. And we continue to look for opportunities to optimize this legacy block of business through risk transfers. As announced yesterday, we have entered into an agreement with Talcott Resolution Life Insurance Company to reinsure approximately $10 billion of U.S. retail variable annuity and rider statutory reserves. I will provide more details on that transaction shortly. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $248 million versus an adjusted loss of $241 million in the prior year. Lower net investment income was partially offset by lower expenses year-over-year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 23.2%, modestly below our 2025 guidance range of 24% to 26%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the four quarters of 2024 and first quarter of '25, which was $327 million. This result was up sequentially but below our implied quarterly run rate of $425 million. Private equity returns were 1.6% in the quarter, and our real estate and other funds yielded an average return of roughly 2% in the quarter. As a reminder, PE and real estate and other funds are reported on a one quarter lag and accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we plan to disclose preliminary information regarding our expectations for the variable investment income in the early part of July. We are doing this for the second quarter given the current environment. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by Segment and corporate and other for the four quarters of 2024 and first quarter of '25. As reflected in the chart, RIS, Asia and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profiles. However, as a reminder, each business has its own discrete portfolio aligned and matched to its liabilities. Moving to expenses on Page 7. This chart shows a comparison of direct expense ratio for the full year 2024 of 12.1%, Q1 of '24 of 11.9% and Q1 of '25 of 12%. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. That said, we believe our results in Q1 position us well to achieve our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.1%, demonstrating our ongoing expense discipline and a sustained efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 8. Overall, MetLife is well capitalized with more than ample liquidity. We opportunistically repurchased about $1.4 billion of our shares in the first quarter and have repurchased approximately $150 million of our shares in April. And as we announced yesterday, our Board has authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program reflecting the collective confidence in our New Frontier strategy and the strength of our balance sheet as well as management's commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $4.5 billion at March 31, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. Beyond repurchases. Cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend and holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we had a $1 billion subordinated debt issuance and redeemed $500 million of maturities in the quarter. Regarding our statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, our 2024 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 388%, which is above our target ratio of 360%. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2025 statutory operating earnings were approximately $600 million, while net income was approximately $500 million. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $16.4 billion as of March 31, 2025, down 6% from year-end 2024, primarily due to dividends paid, partially offset by operating earnings. Finally, we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 725% as of March 31, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Before I wrap up, let me comment on the risk transfer transaction that we announced yesterday, highlights shown on Page 9. As we have discussed in the past, MetLife Holdings is a well-seasoned and well-diversified legacy block. We continue to focus on our primary objectives to meet customer obligations, look for efficiencies in how we operate and seek opportunities to further optimize the business. As we have noted, we have continued to take a third-party perspective which helps us better manage the business internally, while also providing us optionality to appropriately accelerate the release of reserves and capital at the right value with the right strategic partner. This transaction with Talcott Resolution Life Insurance Company covers approximately $10 billion of current U.S. retail variable annuity and rider statutory reserves via funds withheld for the general account reserves and modified coinsurance for the separate account liabilities. This risk transfer significantly lowers our exposure to retail variable annuity tail risk by reducing account values by approximately 40%, which in turn would positively reduce our enterprise risk associated with capital markets and its related volatility. It is expected to deliver approximately $250 million in statutory value, consisting of a ceding commission and release of capital over time. Also, we expect the transaction will result in foregone adjusted earnings in MetLife Holdings of approximately $100 million annually. However, this will be offset by an annual hedge cost savings to the enterprise of roughly $45 million associated with this block of business. In addition, we have secured investment management mandates for MetLife Investment Management to manage roughly $6 billion of assets with Talcott, which supports our strategy to expand third-party fee income. Turning to Page 10. You can see how our VA balances have declined over time, consistent with our strategy. At our 2024 Investor Day in December, we highlighted the left side of the chart, showing the 26% drop in VA balances over the five-year period, from 2019 through 2024. And as shown on the right side of the chart, we expect total VA balances will further decline to $24.5 billion as of March 31, 2025, reflecting the reinsurance transaction with Talcott. Overall, this represents a more than 50% decline in VA balances since 2019, a positive development from MetLife's risk profile. In addition to lower balances, it is also important to note the remaining product mix which will include a significant portion of traditional group retirement variable annuities of roughly $9 billion. These include 403(b) and 457(b) annuities for retirement plans, which have limited guarantees. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a solid quarter, reflecting the strong underlying fundamentals across our portfolio of businesses. While the environment remains uncertain, we remain confident in delivering all weather performance achieved through a position of strength of a strong balance sheet, recurring free cash flow generation and a diversified set of market-leading businesses. As we embark on the new frontier, our strategic priorities allow us to accelerate responsible growth and generate attractive returns with lower risk. Our variable annuity reinsurance transaction with Talcott is another proof point of how MetLife has both the tools and commitment to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. I had a question first on your spreads in the RIS business. If you look at the base yield, it was down, I think, around 11 basis points sequentially, around 13 bps year-over-year and spreads were down ex-VII, almost a similar amount so not sure if that's mix or I know you had interest rate gaps that you might not be benefiting from. But what's driving that? And should we assume a further decline or stabilization in spreads from these levels?
John McCallion: Jimmy, it's John. The answer probably requires a little bit of a holistic view of RIS. I'll give you the punch line upfront is we did have a -- it declined sequentially in spreads, a function of rates and curve offsetting that as growth. So let me give Ramy a chance to just talk about some, I’d say, growth exceeding expectations, and then I'll come back and talk about spreads.
Ramy Tadros: Hey, Jimmy. Thank you, John. Just to give you a sense of the growth momentum this quarter, you can see it in our balances year-over-year and sequentially. But we've got a number of notable wins in the quarter. We've got a very strong Q1 for PRTs with $1.8 billion of inflows. I would note Jimmy that all of these transactions were with sponsors who are Fortune 500 companies, which is really encouraging for us. We talked back in December about the very first U.K. funded re-deal that we did with a well-established U.K. insurer. We continue to see really good momentum for us in that market. Also in the U.K. market, we have a very robust pipeline in the U.K. longevity space, and that's coming off the back of the jumbo transaction that we executed in the quarter. And then last but not least, stable value. We are a leader in that market, and this has been a very strong quarter for us, and we capitalized on some of the market disruption. You put all of these together, we're seeing really strong momentum from an earnings perspective. It's coming from investment spreads, but it's also coming from underwriting and fees over time and you see that in the 8% growth in the liability balances. And for the full year, we expect to be at the upper end of that 3% to 5% balance growth that we guided you back in February. So this is a bit of a growth from a liability balances perspective? And maybe, John, I'll hand it back to you talk about the spreads.
John McCallion: Yes. Yes. And I just thought that maybe just setting that up to start because as you said, we are down a bit sequentially. We did have, as you mentioned, a 7 basis point decline in the core spread. When we were going through this back in February, we did expect a decline. We had the remaining roll-off of the interest rate caps. We expected that to be a five or six point drag but had expected to partially offset that with certain management actions in the quarter. However, we had some -- rates were different. The path of rates were different. We had lower rates than expected. We had a flatter curve than expected and so it became a bit difficult to reposition the portfolio and leverage some of our tools we had to offset that cap roll-off. The second thing we had in the quarter is we had more than expected paydowns in certain structures -- higher yielding structured securities and loans. And when we redeploying that, you ultimately -- you were redeploying that at some lower spreads, and that was in the early part of the quarter. So those two things impacted our ability to offset some of the cap roll off in the quarter. But as Ramy said, if you take growth is probably exceeding expectations cap are coming in a little lower here likely going to stabilize from here into the second quarter. And net-net, you're effectively flat relative to earnings expectations. So hopefully, that gives a little color as to how to think about the two.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on your CRE portfolio, the main metrics are pretty similar with how they've been recently with loan to values and coverage ratios and it seems like things were starting to stabilize, but are you seeing indications that with all this uncertainty that the recovery is going to stall? Or what are you seeing in the crucial mortgage loan book?
John McCallion: Yes, good question. As you said, real estate activity and office leasing, it really was continuing to show some late in the year and even into Q1. I think our statistics show that office leasing activity in Q1 was the strongest we've seen since like mid-2019. Investment activity has been up year-over-year as well, I think, roughly 10%. So generally, there's been some good momentum. But I would say that we'll have to just monitor the kind of where we are in terms of some of the uncertainty that's out there. So it might slow a little momentum. I don't -- I think our feeling is the sector has found a trough in values, generally, all else equal, and we saw that in some of our LTVs and our debt service coverage ratio. But I mentioned this maybe last quarter, this year and probably next year, you will resolve a lot of the things that we put up reserves were over the last several years. And so this will be kind of the resolution point, but that tends to happen at the trough. And I think -- so we still think we're there. Again, it's a bit all else equal, but we are feeling and we saw look, if you go back to VII, we had a 2% roughly return on the real estate-related funds in the quarter. So there are signs of improvement, but obviously, we'll have to just see how long the uncertainty persists.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Good morning. First question is on the risk transfer deal. I guess on its face, the pricing maybe it doesn't look so great in terms of, we'll call it, the earnings multiple of what you're giving up. But as we all know, this is kind of a pretty volatile higher tail risk. So I think that should be considered. But can you talk a bit about the way you approached it valuation-wise, I guess you're giving up 50 million roughly of net income. How much cash flow do you end up losing and then talk a little bit about how you view the tail risk and overall why this deal made economic sense for you? Thanks.
Ramy Tadros: Sure. So Tom, it's Ramy here. Let me just maybe give you a sense of we got to the deal and then we'll tackle some of the specific questions you had. You should definitely look at this in the context of the new Frontier strategy that we talked about, in particular in the lower-risk pillar of that strategy. We have taken a very disciplined approach here as we looked at potential transactions, especially in the context that have a well-seasoned and well-managed book. But for us, the goal here is to create value for our shareholders and all our other stakeholders. So the reinsurance partner matters, the structure really matters, but so does the price and we do look at the price from a number of lenses including an economic lens when we think about the valuation of the book, and we definitely have a view of that, which the price was very much in line with and we also look at it in terms of the impact, if you will, from a loss of GAAP earnings perspective versus the seeding commission but you should look at that also in the context of the cost of hedging that we're also now are no longer incurring. So net-net-net, when you put that together, the value that we received was very much in line with our expectations. And it also removes a lot of the tail risk, which, as you know, the capital requirements for this business could be significantly higher should we see a downturn in the equity and the interest rate environment. So all of these things were part of our consideration. Maybe I'll let John talk about the cash flow pieces of this.
John McCallion: Yes. I think you -- your question kind of summarized it, Tom. We would think of the cash flow as kind of the net of the two. That's generally that you're kind of -- you could think of that as almost your change in tech -- so it's probably a good proxy for what we're -- but I think to Ramy's point, it's what you're giving up in like a stable environment, right? And so if things were -- the environment changes, the economics can change. So equity markets over several years now have been on an upward trajectory. We have higher interest rates and it was really an opportunistic way for us to kind of lock in the exit value here and also finding a really good partner that we've been able to work with and get to know and feel good about the transaction.
Tom Gallagher: Got you. Thanks. And then just my follow-up, can you comment on what your underwriting experience was like in MetLife Holdings this quarter between let's say, on the mortality side, for life insurance and then also on long-term care? Thanks.
Ramy Tadros: It was very much in line this quarter across both the LTC book as well as the retail life book. So nothing to note here in terms of underwriting across MLH.
Tom Gallagher: Thanks, Ramy.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Yes, thanks. Good morning. First question was more high level. Just hoping to get some thoughts on the current environment. To what extent is it influencing changes in how you're managing the company, I guess, for example, are you -- would you anticipate any changes to the capital management strategy or the expense strategy given the uncertainty in this environment? Or do you view things largely as business as usual for now?
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Hi, good morning, Ryan. Thanks for the question. It's Michel. So clearly, we're not oblivious to the environment in which we operate. We sort of -- I think it's fair to say that the possibility of a recession has risen. Having said that, I think our strategy, we like to call it all weather because, again, it doesn't assume a rosy picture. It does not assume a deep recession either so I would say we're very much focused on executing on the pillars of the strategy. So no change whatsoever when it comes to that. I think you can see from sort of our capital management action that, again, there no change in terms of our approach. The 3 billion authorization the 4.1% increase in income and dividends per share, again, sort of evidence in terms of the confidence that our Board and we have and our financial standing. Given the environment, we tend to focus on those levers that we do control expenses as one of them. We want to continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives, but at the same time, there are discretionary aspects to expenses that we -- that have asked the team to make sure that we're managing really, really well given the environment. But beyond that, I would say, I don't like to use the term BAU, but I would say we're very much sticking to our strategy and really pleased also with the underlying momentum that we're seeing across our businesses.
Ryan Krueger: Thank you. And then in group benefits, PFO growth, I think ex participating policies was towards the lower end of your target. Can you give a little bit more color on what you're seeing and also how you think that may progress as the year goes along?
Ramy Tadros: Thank you, Ryan and good morning. So if you think about our 2% reported number here, there are two drivers driving that kind of headline number. The first and the larger impact, I would say, is the favorable mortality we saw from those participating contracts, which John talked about -- if you compare our life underwriting ratios year-over-year, we did see more than a 5-point drop in mortality this quarter from Q1 of 24, really great outcome from an underwriting perspective, especially in what is a seasonally high mortality quarter. As you know, Q1 does tend to be heavier. Now the impact that has on our participating contracts, you get lower death claims which result in lower premiums. So if you exclude that impact, the underlying PFO growth was about 4%. So you're talking about a 200 basis points growth that is masked in our headline number. The other driver for the quarter does relate to our 1, 1 rate actions that we took on our dental block. As we discussed a few times over the last six months, we did see a faster-than-expected acceleration in dental utilization. As part of our underwriting discipline, we are very quick to take actions when we see the market utilization numbers move and one -- one is the most significant renewal date for our dental business. So these actions did have an impact on our persistency in the dental block, but we remain disciplined in the market and we did get the rate increases that we required and we walked away from some business that didn't meet our target margins. I would say, as you look forward the dental rate actions are largely behind us at this point. And, in fact, we're seeing the earnings benefit starting to come through our dental earnings. And as you think about the full year both of these effects, the par impact as well as the dental impact will moderate. So you should expect us for a full year reported basis to be back in line with our guidance of 4% to 7%. And you would have had another 100 basis points or so, if you want to look at the underlying numbers, which exclude the power contracts. And then the last thing I would say is based on our really strong results this quarter, we're also expecting no change to our full year outlook on earnings for the group business.
Ryan Krueger: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to ask on the buyback. It was obviously very strong in the first quarter. And in April, it was pretty modest. And I get your comment about kind of catching up to back activity in the fourth quarter. But was there anything in the month of April that was sort of precluding you from maybe leaning in a little bit. I don't know if this VA deal was big enough where you were blacked out. But anything going on with the timing there?
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Hi, Suneet, Michel here. No, I think we sort of -- April was sort of in line with -- we did what we set out to do, I would say. So there wasn't any impact from any pending announcements or anything like that. As I mentioned in the first quarter we leaned then, given the fact that in the fourth quarter, given some pending announcements there, we were precluded from potentially doing more than we did. But clearly, as I said, you can expect a more measured pace from here. So don't use the 1.4 billion in the quarter as a quarterly run rate. And we'll continue to be opportunistic, but deliberate as well when it comes to our activity here. What I would also reiterate is that nothing changes in how we think about capital. Our first priority is funding attractive organic growth. Next, we will look for strategic inorganic opportunities that are risk-adjusted hurdle rate clearing and I think PineBridge is a good example of that and then if we have excess capital, we will return it deliberately over time as we've consistently done.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. That's fine. That makes sense. And then, I guess, for Ramy. Obviously, the PRT sales in the first quarter were pretty strong. But in markets like this where interest rates are moving around and equity markets are swinging around and maybe the funding status of pension plans or swinging around as well. Does that do anything to kind of activity in the market one way or the other? Just want to get a sense of how we should think about if this environment persists, what PRT could look like as we move through the year? Thanks.
Ramy Tadros: Thank you, Suneet. I mean excessive market volatility does have an impact, I would say it's more of a timing impact in terms of from a plan sponsor perspective, it can be a distraction in terms of ensuring how they're kind of thinking about their ALM and in the context of highly volatile markets. But having said that, if you think about the space that we play in, in the PRT space, the jumbo space, these are planned sponsors who have been on a derisking journey for a number of years. And therefore, as part of that derisking journey they are far more hedged, if you will, from a liability-driven perspective, both in terms of their interest rate, exposure of the assets versus the liabilities and would be largely out of the kind of risky bucket of assets, equities, alternatives well before the point that they're ready to transact. So which that tells you the stability of the segment of PRT plan sponsor of DB plan sponsors who would transact well hedged and we wouldn't expect to see much change in their funding ratios. And therefore, we think there may be a temporary impact in terms of a distraction if you will, but we don't see that having a real change in terms of the pipeline of the transactions that will come through.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wes Carmichael with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Wes Carmichael: Hi, good morning. First question on variable investment income. I think you have guided for a bit more normal return in 2025 and a pretty decent result in the quarter. But given the market volatility in April and some shelved IPOs in the wake of tariff announcements, are you expecting you can still come in at a more normal level for the year? And if you have any insight into Q2, that would be helpful?
John McCallion: Hi, Wes good morning, it's John. Yes. So VII in this quarter, I mean, private equity, as we mentioned in our opening remarks had a 1.6% return in the quarter. Just as a side note, we also saw over 600 million of distributions come through so well in excess of actually the earnings we saw in the quarter. Again, I would say, a function of our well-diversified seasoned portfolio in the private equity funds. We also had real estate funds on average come in and real estate-related funds come in around 2%. So lower than kind of the implied run rate from the guidance we gave, but above the fourth quarter, which was in line with the range we gave a quarter ago. And to your point around the outlook, look, while these investments have tended to lag public equity markets, public equity markets did very well last year. We saw, obviously, there's a number of factors why PE returns were lag there. But the current environment creates some challenge and an already difficult to project PE probably more challenging to predict in the current environment. So one of the things I mentioned in my opening remarks is that in light of this uncertainty, we plan to actually provide some preliminary information in early July on the VII and we should have decent insight. So just again, in light of the kind of the, I'd say, the unusual situation that we have, we'll look to do that as opposed to trying to forecast anything for now. So hopefully, that helps.
Wes Carmichael: Yes, it does. Thanks, John And I guess my second question, I know I've asked a couple of times before, but as we're nearing implementation of the ESR in Japan, I think there are a couple of conversations with the industry and the regulator on some treatment of long duration and FX-denominated products. Are you still feeling pretty good about implementation and any thoughts on how that folds into your expected reinsurance strategy?
John McCallion: Yes. I think you asked it a few times we'll probably give you the same answer we've given a few other times, which is still feeling pretty good. We -- it's an effective April 1, probably three things to think about. One is operational readiness. We feel like we're in a good position. It wasn't -- there are things that aren't perfect. But all in all, taking the collective weight of items, certainly one we can manage through. And we feel like we've made really good progress with the new framework. Other things to just remind you, we've always priced under an economic framework in the past. So moving to this it really doesn't change how we would operate. We always had a view of economic and in the statutory framework. So that was always under our mentality, making sure good ALM always matched in terms of rates and currency in terms of our products. So -- and then I think we'll -- as we look at it now, there's certainly nothing that would indicate that it would change our dividend policy or factor as it relates to Japan.
Wes Carmichael: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wilma Burdis with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Wilma Burdis: Hey, good morning. We just worked on an analysis of portfolio yield. And what we found is that men provides a very attractive risk-adjusted return. Could you just talk about how you market NIM and what the organic growth type look pipeline looks like there? Thanks.
John McCallion: Hi Wilma, thanks for that. Well, you can -- feel free to share that announcement or analysis, we'd like to see it, too. But look I think from a philosophy perspective, we certainly feel the same. And certainly, as it relates to clients that we look to serve. And look I think pipeline continues to be good coming out. It's -- obviously, there's a variety of different factors over the last different few years, but there's been a steady growth in the client segments that we serve. And that's -- we see that continuing. I think to your point, I think the quality of our products and solutions that we offer we believe, is differentiated and certainly provide what we believe is a great long-term value for our clients and our partners. So as of now, I'd say things continue. There's a lot of activity out there. There's a lot of opportunities from a business development perspective, and we're very optimistic of our five-year strategy here. So hopefully, that helps.
Wilma Burdis: Great. And could you just talk about the type of assets that you're managing for Talcott? Thank you.
John McCallion: Yes. We don't get into too much details, but I'll give you -- generally, there's $6 billion of assets that we were able to obtain through an investment management mandate. Half of it is a function of some of the assets that are part of this transaction. Another half was actually separate. But as we obviously got to know and built a relationship with Talcott over time and also being able to share some of our capabilities, we're able to work with them and provide additional mandate on top of that. Mostly, I'll just say in some of the public fixed income area, but also some of those were overseas. So maybe that helps.
Wilma Burdis: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Hurwitz with Dowling. Please go ahead.
Joel Hurwitz: Hey good morning. Can you unpack the nonmedical health loss experience in the quarter I get the seasonality, but was surprised to see it up a bit year-over-year? And I guess how is dental experienced this quarter versus last year period?
Ramy Tadros: Sure. It's Ramy here. So maybe let me start with the dental piece. So the performance of the dental business in this quarter was well in line with our expectations. Recall that Q1 just tends to be a higher utilization quarter as the benefit resets. And then I'll also just point you to what I just mentioned earlier with respect to the disciplined underwriting here in terms of the actions that we've been taking on 1/1, and we're certainly pleased with the outcome of those actions. And that will set us up nicely in combination with the heavy Q1 utilization quarter behind us to see a gradual decline for the nonmedical health ratio. And think of that for the full year being towards the midpoint of our range. The other parts of the ratio, disability continues to perform very much in line with our expectations. STD and LTD incidents came in right on the mark. We continue to see very strong recoveries in terms of the closures. I would say those are coming in slightly ahead of our expectations in the disability block. And the small headwind we did see in disability relates to delays in the social security administration approvals which did have somewhat of an impact this quarter, albeit small. So net-net, I would say, performing in line with our expectations and think of a full year number to be close to the midpoint of our range.
Joel Hurwitz: Got it. Very helpful. And then switching gears. Other Asia sales were very strong in the quarter. Can you just unpack what you saw there? And then I guess with the increased geopolitical tensions. What are you seeing in April thus far?
Lyndon Oliver: Joel, it's Lyndon here. Yes. So let me give you color on kind of the overall sales in Asia, and we'll cover what happens in Japan as well as what's going on in the rest of Asia. We've had a strong start to the year. First quarter sales were up 10% across the region. And we're on track to grow full year sales in line with our outlook of mid to high single digits. So let's start with Japan. We've had a good strong start. We've got strong market share across all our distribution channels, including the banca channel. And while we've seen some decline in the FX products in recent quarters, we are seeing momentum pick up. If you look at the sequential growth in the first quarter, it was strong. Now looking at April, Michel mentioned, we launched a new single premium life product in the bank channel. This has been very well received and we've got other actions planned during the rest of the year. So we expect this momentum to continue. Now going to the rest of Asia, outstanding quarter. Sales were up 41% from the prior year. And this is driven primarily by China, where we saw the addition of some new bank partners come on Board and that really helped with the sales there. And also in Korea, very strong performance in our face-to-face channels both in Korea agency as well as in the independent channels. So I hope that helps.
Joel Hurwitz: Thank you.
Operator: We have time for one more question, and that question comes from Nick Anido with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Nick Anido: Hi, good morning. Thanks. Just wanted to touch on Group Life and the expectation for the balance of the year, given it's been coming in pretty strong. Is it something you have confidence in for like a sustained period? Or is it more touch and go for the outer quarters?
Ramy Tadros: Thanks for the question. Just maybe to comment on this quarter first. So we did see favorable incidents and really, you can draw almost a straight line between our results and the CDC population data results for the working age population. And that favorability has been manifesting itself for the last kind of couple of quarters and working its way into our ratios. I would say at this point, I can't speculate and I don't want to speculate if the favorability will continue for the rest of the year. It's too early to tell. But what may be useful is just to come back to our outlook guidance ratios. So remember, we guided to be at the midpoint of the lower half of our range. So think of that as kind of an 85.5% number. And that guidance always assumes a heavier Q1 mortality. So with Q1 behind us and Q1 being favorable, just a simple arithmetic here even if we continue not to see any further favorability, the simple arithmetic would have us towards the lower end of our range for the full year. So think about an 84 number for the full year compared to the guidance that we have given you before.
Nick Anido: Got it. That's really helpful. And then I guess just on Chariot Re, can you guys give any update there? I think you previously said the expectation would be to do initial back book deal out of Met, but any update there would be helpful? Thanks
Michel Khalaf: Yes, hi. Nick, it's Michel. So really pleased with our progress, and we're excited about the growth opportunities that Chariot Re, will allow us to capture. We're moving at pace with our cosponsor and Atlantic to fully capitalize and operationalize the company. The intention here, I'll just reiterate as to create a long-term partnership between MetLife and Chariot Re. And as we discussed at Investor Day, Chariot Re would enhance our capital flexibility and efficiency and allow us to generate liability growth beyond our balance sheet capacity if need be. And again, our plans are sort of on track, I would say, in terms of expecting to launch around midyear.
Operator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the conference back over to John Hall for closing remarks.
John Hall: Great. Thank you, operator, and thank you everybody for joining us. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings and Outlook conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a Q&A session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife, Inc. SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's fourth quarter 2024 earnings and near-term outlook call. Before we begin, I point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the investor relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer and Head of MetLife Investment Management. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides which address the quarter as well as our near-term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations, and other information which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which will end promptly at the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, MetLife, Inc. reported fourth quarter and full year results that underscore the strength and resilience of our market-leading portfolio of businesses in the face of constant change. While unemployment in the US has stayed at low levels and economic growth appears healthy, the pace of anticipated interest rate cuts remains in question due to concerns about persistent inflation. MetLife, Inc.'s capacity to execute across changing environments has been a hallmark of our success. This past year, 2024, brought to a close the five-year period associated with our Next Horizon strategy. Despite the global pandemic, a short-lived banking crisis, and volatile interest rates, we delivered on all our Next Horizon financial commitments: return on equity, free cash flow, and operating leverage. The market has recognized our strong fundamental performance as MetLife, Inc.'s stock outperformed the Standard and Poor's 500 index in 2024. MetLife, Inc. did not go quietly until the end of the year, and we do not rest on our laurels. In December, we hosted a well-received investor day to roll out our New Frontier strategy, along with a refreshed set of financial commitments. While the basic tenets of Next Horizon—focus, simplify, and differentiate—aren't going anywhere, MetLife, Inc. is at a different place than it was five years ago. We are more front-footed and more able to play offense. Our New Frontier strategy is more oriented towards growth, and by that, I mean responsible growth. To build on this, we have identified four strategic priorities as part of New Frontier. Together, they drive nearly 80% of adjusted earnings today and will fuel strong growth through the five-year New Frontier strategy. The first is further extending our leadership in group benefits. The second is capitalizing on our unique retirement platform. The third is accelerating growth in asset management, while the fourth is expanding in high-growth international markets. Again, here at MetLife, Inc., we do not stand still. Along with the rollout of our New Frontier strategy, we announced several important transactions that activate across our new strategic priorities and which we believe will drive shareholder value for years to come. In December, MetLife, Inc. and General Atlantic announced the formation of Cherry Tree, which will be a Bermuda-based life and annuity reinsurance company. We anticipate a combined equity investment of over $1 billion and that Chubb will join us as an anchor investor. Cherry Tree will serve the growing demand for life and retirement solutions around the world. Strategic use of reinsurance allows us to position MetLife, Inc. to capture the growth this trend and add to enterprise value. Cherry Tree would also leverage MetLife, Inc.'s deep insurance and investing expertise as well as the investment capabilities of General Atlantic. Also in December, we announced an agreement to acquire PineBridge Investments, a leading global asset manager with approximately $100 billion in assets under management. PineBridge will substantially add to MetLife Investment Management by expanding its public and private credit offerings, especially on an international basis. Finally, MIM signed an agreement to acquire the high yield and bank loan, the strategic fixed income, and the small cap equity teams from Mesero Financial with about $6 billion of assets managed by those teams. Our New Frontier strategy is more than just words on a page. To measure our progress and hold ourselves accountable, we have established new five-year commitments. We have introduced adjusted earnings per share as a new metric for MetLife, Inc. We are committed to achieving double-digit adjusted EPS growth over the course of the New Frontier period, with 60% driven by business and margin growth, and the balance from disciplined capital management. We have increased our adjusted return on equity target range to 15% to 17%, up from our previous target range of 13% to 15%. We have also committed to cut another 100 basis points from our prior direct expense ratio target of 12.3% during the five-year period. And finally, we have committed to $25 billion of free cash flow over the five-year period, up from our prior five-year $20 billion commitment. You'll see when John discusses our 2025 outlook, these commitments are in alignment with our expectation for the near term. Now turning to our fourth quarter 2024 results. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.5 billion or $2.09 per share, up 14% from the prior year period. Excluding notable items in both periods, we reported adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share, up 8%. Variable investment income, or VII, was higher in the quarter due to improved private equity fund performance, and we saw good momentum across most of our businesses. Shifting to the full year 2024, we generated adjusted earnings excluding notable items of $5.8 billion. Strong volume growth and favorable underwriting, along with market factors, helped drive our results. Pointing to our capital efficiency, MetLife, Inc. posted an adjusted ROE of 15.2% for the year, above our target range, and our direct expense ratio was 12.1%, beating our Next Horizon target range. Our group benefits business continues to demonstrate its leadership position in what I believe to be the most attractive segment of US life insurance. Group benefits generated adjusted earnings excluding notable items of $1.7 billion in 2024. Full year sales were up 8% on strong growth in national accounts. This is a business where we believe that scale, technology, and discipline will carry the day. We believe MetLife, Inc. has the capacity to continue to grow faster than the market, driven by the many scale benefits associated with our size. In the New Frontier, our formula for group benefits growth is simple: more employers, more products, and more employee participation, and we are actively driving each of these elements. Moving to retirement and income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings excluding notables totaled $1.6 billion in the year. RIS continued to demonstrate the strength and breadth of its liability generation capabilities in 2024. Our liability exposures grew 3.4% in the year, above the midpoint of our prior outlook range, with strong contributions from structured settlements, UK longevity and funded reinsurance, and US pension risk transfer. Shifting to our international businesses, Asia posted adjusted earnings excluding notables of $1.7 billion in 2024, up 21% on the rebound in VII. General account AUM grew 5% on a constant currency basis. It was also a historic year for our Latin America business, which saw record adjusted earnings excluding notables of $877 million despite substantial currency headwinds. Our expanded product portfolio in the region and our investments in digital distribution place us in the pole position to further grow in this important region. When I look across our business results for the year, what stands out is the balance of our adjusted earnings across segments. Our three largest segments—group benefits, RIS, and Asia—all posted adjusted earnings in the neighborhood of $1.7 billion. I have framed MetLife, Inc.'s balance and diversification as being our superpower, something that has enabled us to generate the type of all-weather performance achieved in 2024. Moving to capital management. In the fourth quarter, our buyback activity was restricted due to pending announcements. In total, we still repurchased nearly $400 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter. We have started the new year strong, having repurchased roughly $470 million of our common stock in January. For the full year 2024, we returned approximately $4.7 billion to shareholders, through $3.2 billion of our common stock repurchases, and $1.5 billion of common stock dividends. In closing, 2024 marks the end of Next Horizon and the beginning of New Frontier, where we are starting from a position of strength and with a greater emphasis on responsible growth. MetLife, Inc. operates in highly attractive markets with deep competitive moats that we've constructed carefully over time. And we are poised to capitalize on the many global tailwinds which have informed our New Frontier strategy. MetLife, Inc. is well-positioned to deliver strong responsible growth, attractive returns, and with lower risk. Not one or the other, but all three. And that is MetLife, Inc.'s unique value proposition. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in greater detail.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. I will start with the 4Q 2024 supplemental slides, which cover highlights of our financial performance, including an update on our liquidity and capital position. In addition, I will discuss our near-term outlook. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. Net income was $1.2 billion and $4.2 billion for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024, respectively. The difference between net income and adjusted earnings is attributable to net derivative losses, primarily due to the rise in long-term interest rates and the strengthening of the US dollar. That said, derivative losses were partially offset by market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement gains due to higher interest rates. In addition, net investment losses were largely the result of normal trading activity on the portfolio in a rising interest rate environment, and credit remains stable. As highlighted on the bottom of the page, we had two notable items in the current quarter, netting to a positive impact to adjusted earnings of $10 million. This was primarily due to interest associated with a tax refund partially offset by higher asbestos litigation reserves in the quarter. On page four, we provide a year-over-year comparison of fourth quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Excluding total notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings excluding total notable items were $1.4 billion, up 1% and 3% on a constant currency basis. The increase was primarily driven by higher variable investment income and solid volume growth, which were partially offset by less favorable recurring interest and expense margins compared to the previous year. Adjusted earnings per share excluding total notable items were $2.08, up 8% and 10% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, group benefits adjusted earnings were $416 million, down 11% from the prior year quarter. The key driver was less favorable nonmedical health underwriting margins compared to the prior year. The nonmedical health interest adjusted benefit ratio was 71.8%. Although above the prior year, it was in line with expectations and within our annual target range of 69% to 74%. The group life mortality ratio was 83.2% for the quarter. For the full year, the ratio was 84.5%, at the bottom end of our 2024 target range of 84% to 89%. Turning to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs on a full-year basis were up 4% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 100 basis points, the underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year, within our 2024 target growth range of 4% to 6%. RIS adjusted earnings were $386 million in 4Q of 2024, down 8% year-over-year. The primary drivers were lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher variable investment income. Solid volume growth also contributed to the year-over-year results. RIS total investment spreads were 112 basis points, up 6 basis points sequentially, mainly due to higher variable investment income as our core spread remained flat at 108 basis points, consistent with expectations. RIS adjusted PFOs were up 26%, primarily driven by growth across several products, most notably PRT, including UK funded reinsurance. As we highlighted at investor day, we completed our inaugural funded reinsurance transaction for approximately $300 million, demonstrating the successful relationships that we have built with leading UK insurers. This brings our total PRT inflows for both the US and UK combined to approximately $6.7 billion for 2024. Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were $443 million, up 50% and 52% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income and favorable underwriting margins, which included positive reserve refinements that benefited adjusted earnings by roughly $30 million for Asia's full year 2024 key growth metrics. General account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were down 5% on a constant currency basis versus 2023. Lower Japan sales were partially offset by other Asia markets, which were up 21%, most notably due to solid growth in Korea, India, and China. In Japan, sales were down 18% year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of yen volatility on foreign currency products. Latin America adjusted earnings were $201 million, down 3%, but up 10% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher volume growth across the region, partially offset by lower Chilean and CAE return versus a strong Q4 2023. Latin America's top line continues to perform well, although reported growth rates are being masked by recent currency headwinds. Adjusted PFOs were down 3%, but up 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth and solid persistency across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $59 million, up 26% and 31% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by solid volume growth and lower tax charges in the quarter. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins and underwriting margins year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 10% and 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong sales across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $153 million, down 2%, largely driven by foregone earnings as a result of the reinsurance transaction that closed in November 2023. Favorable life underwriting was a partial offset. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $209 million versus an adjusted loss of $156 million in the prior year. Higher expenses and taxes were partially offset by higher variable investment income. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 23.5%, modestly below our 2024 guidance range of 24% to 26%. On page five, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2024. Variable investment income was $293 million in Q4, driven by the private equity portfolio, which had an average return of 1.8% in the quarter. Our real estate and other funds had an average return of essentially zero in the quarter. As a reminder, PE and real estate and other funds are reported on a one-quarter lag and accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. For the full year, variable investment income or VII was $1 billion, lower than our 2024 target of approximately $1.5 billion but well ahead of the prior year. Real estate and other funds accounted for most of the shortfall, while PE returns were largely in line with our annual 2024 expected returns. On page six, we provide VII post-tax by segment and corporate and other for the four quarters and full year 2024. As reflected in the chart, Asia, RIS, and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profiles. However, as a reminder, each business has its own discrete portfolio, aligned and matched to its liabilities. Asia's VII portfolio outperformed in the quarter, generating more than 50% of the total. Turning to page seven, this chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over eight quarters and full year 2023 and 2024. Our direct expense ratio for Q4 of 2024 was elevated at 13.1%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs and group benefits, as well as higher employee-related costs and technology initiatives. That said, as we've highlighted previously, we believe our full-year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2024, our direct expense ratio was 12.1%, below our 2024 target of 12.3%. We believe this result once again demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on a sustained efficiency mindset. I'll now discuss our cash and capital positions on page eight. Overall, MetLife, Inc. is well-capitalized with more than ample liquidity. We had share repurchases of roughly $400 million in the fourth quarter and have repurchased shares totaling $470 million in January. In terms of statutory capital for our US companies, preliminary 2024 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4 billion, while net income was approximately $2.9 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $500 million year-over-year, primarily driven by impacts of the reinsurance transaction in November 2023, and lower net investment income partially offset by favorable underwriting. On page nine, this chart shows the final tally in beating our five-year financial commitments under Next Horizon. Our full-year 2024 adjusted ROE of 15.2% was above our original 12% to 14% commitment made in 2019, and above our 13% to 15% guidance for 2024. For the years 2020 through 2024, we generated distributable cash of $20.7 billion, above our $20 billion commitment, and created $1.2 billion of additional operating leverage capacity to accelerate growth above our $1 billion commitment. Now let's turn to page eleven for further details on our near-term outlook starting with the overview. Based on the forward currency curve, the US dollar is expected to further strengthen, which creates a headwind to adjusted earnings growth of approximately $150 to $175 million in 2025. This impact is embedded in the non-US segment outlooks I will discuss in a moment. The forward interest rate curve projects long-term interest rates to be stable, and the yield curve to steepen, a positive development. We use an assumption of a 5% annual return for the S&P 500. For our near-term targets, these are consistent with our New Frontier commitments that we announced at investor day. We expect to achieve double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We expect adjusted ROE to be in the range of 15% to 17%. We expect to maintain our two-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings, which supports our five-year commitment to generate $25 billion plus of free cash flow. Also, given our continued focus on expense discipline, we target reducing our expense ratio down 100 basis points to 11.3% by 2029. Therefore, for 2025, we are lowering our direct expense ratio guidance to 12.1%, down from 12.3% in 2024. Specifically, for 2025, variable investment income is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion pretax. Our corporate and other adjusted loss is expected to be between $850 to $950 million after tax. We are maintaining our expected effective tax rate range of 24% to 26%. At the bottom of the page, you'll see certain interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, reflecting a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term. Further sensitivities are in the appendix to these slides. On page twelve, the chart reflects our expectation of VII average asset balances to be stable in 2025. We are increasing our near-term expected annual returns for private equity to be 9% to 11%, and we are also increasing our expected returns for real estate and other funds to be in a range of 7% to 9% over the near term. In 2025, we expect both PE and real estate and other funds to be toward the lower end of their respective ranges before trending higher in 2026 and 2027. Finally, as a reminder, we include prepayment fees on fixed maturities and mortgage loans in VII. Now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Let's start with the US on page thirteen. For group benefits, we are increasing our adjusted PFO growth target to 4% to 7% annually over the near term. We are maintaining our near-term underwriting guidance ranges: group life mortality ratio of 84% to 89%, and group nonmedical health interest adjusted benefit ratio of 69% to 74%. Please keep in mind, these are annual ratios and both typically skew to the higher end of the ranges in the first quarter given the seasonality of the business. However, for group life, if the positive trend we have seen in the last couple of quarters persists into the first half of the year, we expect the full-year ratio to be in the bottom half of the guidance range in 2025. Lastly, we expect group benefits adjusted earnings to benefit from factors outside of underwriting, largely from continued change in our product mix, greater operating efficiencies, and higher investment income, which will add an incremental 5% to 10% to adjusted earnings in 2025. For RIS, we've talked about the business being comprised primarily of spread and fee earnings. To that end, we provide a long-term balance growth range for total liabilities, which can be used to project our future spread and fee balances. In light of the opportunity we see under New Frontier, we are now increasing our total liability annual growth guidance to 3% to 5%. The total spread guidance range for the upcoming year can be applied to our projected general account balances to get a good proxy for our pretax spread income before expenses. We expect 2025 total general account investment spread to be 110 to 135 basis points, assuming the forward curve holds and based on our VII estimate for 2025. We anticipate our core spread to stabilize from 2025 forward now that all remaining interest rate caps have matured. Beyond spread earnings, total fee and underwriting income, net of expenses, adds an incremental 5% to RIS adjusted earnings. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline approximately 4% to 6% in 2025, and we are lowering the adjusted earnings guidance range to $650 to $800 million in 2025. The business run-off accelerated in 2024 to roughly 9%, and variable annuity lapses were higher during the year. Now let's look at the near-term guidance for our segments outside the US on page fourteen. For Asia, we expect sales to grow mid to high single digits on a constant currency basis over the near term. In addition, we expect general account AUM on a constant currency basis to maintain mid-single-digit growth. Asia adjusted earnings in 2025 are expected to grow mid-single digits on a constant currency basis and low single digits on a reported basis given the yen weakness assumed in the forward curve. For 2026 and 2027, adjusted earnings are expected to grow mid-single digits on both a reported and constant currency basis. For Latin America, we expect both adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings in 2025 to grow high single digits on a constant currency basis and flat on a reported basis given the forward currency rates, which assumes Mexican and Chilean pesos weaken in 2025. For 2026 and 2027, we expect adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings to grow high single digits on both a reported and constant currency basis. Finally, for EMEA, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to grow mid to high single digits on a reported basis. For adjusted earnings, we expect EMEA's new quarterly run rate to be $70 to $75 million in 2025, and then grow mid-single digits in 2026 and 2027. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife, Inc. delivered a solid quarter to close out another strong year. Fourth quarter and full year results reflected the strong underlying fundamentals continue to move forward. From a position of strength with a strong balance sheet, recurring free cash flow generation, and a diversified set of market-leading businesses. As we complete the final leg of our Next Horizon journey, we are pleased to have exceeded all the commitments we made. Now as we forge our way into the New Frontier, our strategic priorities position us well to deliver on our unique value proposition of accelerating responsible growth, and generating attractive returns with lower risk. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, if you have been called upon to ask your question and are listening via loudspeaker on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. Again, press star one to join the queue. Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. My first question was for Ramy Tadros on group. Can you give some additional details and color on one-one renewals, what you saw in terms of competition pricing, and any other factors you'd highlight?
Ramy Tadros: Sure, Ryan. Good morning. So I would say we're off to a really good start in one-one. We've had renewals and persistency within our expectations. We're particularly pleased with the renewal action on the dental business, which we've talked about before in terms of getting our targeted rate actions as well as maintaining very strong persistency. So off to a really strong start in one-one, and that's part of the reason why we really also feel good about taking our PFO guidance range from four to seven, which is a one-point increase from where we were last year.
Ryan Krueger: Thanks. And then my question on the, I guess, somewhat broader question on the PRT market. There were a number of lawsuits targeted against one specific provider and plan sponsors that chose them. It's gotten expanded to a couple more. MetLife, Inc. has not been involved with this at this point. But I guess just curious, you know, are you starting to see any level of lean in that market as plan sponsors might be more concerned about this lawsuit activity, or is it not really having much of an impact for you guys at this point?
Ramy Tadros: Hey, Ryan. It's Ramy here again. Look, it's very hard to forecast what and if any impact this is going to have on the market. What may be helpful is just to share with you what we're seeing as of now. So one, this is a very well-established market. It does operate within the rules and regulations, which govern plan sponsors' responsibilities and a very robust solvency regulation, which govern insurance companies. And within that context, the PRT products offer a really valuable solution for plan sponsors and retirees. So in the here and now, we finished last year with $6.4 billion of inflows for PRTs and healthy ROEs. And we're off to a really good start in 2025. We had a $640 million plan that we wrote in the first part of 2025. And the factors that we talked about that will continue to drive this market in terms of the funded status, the financial and the industrial logic, will persist. And is also reflective of the pipeline. So we still see a pipeline. We still see interest here. And we haven't really seen any material impact on the market. And just to step back outside of PRT and think about our RIS liability origination in general, inclusive of all the pieces we talked about on our investor day, as well as the adjacencies that we talked about. We still here feel really good that we will deliver the 3% to 5% balance growth over the near term, which is also a point up from where we were last year. So in aggregate, we still feel really good about that range. Sitting here today.
Ryan Krueger: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Good morning. First question for Ramy Tadros as well. Some peers have called out elevated voluntary benefit loss ratios this quarter. Did you also see that? And when I consider that impact, plus the benefits you expect to get from dental repricing, would you say nonmedical health loss ratio is going to be better or worse in 2025 versus 2024?
Ramy Tadros: Hey. Good morning, Tom. I would say for accident health, we aren't seeing any material deviations outside of what you would call the normal range of expectations, and we look at this on a product-by-product basis. Remember, it's not one single product. So I wouldn't say we've seen any material deviations here, and we continue to see robust growth here with really solid margins. If you think about next year versus this year, we did finish 2024 about less than a point above the midpoint of our range. We haven't changed the range for next year, so a good starting point for 2025 is to go back at the midpoint of that range on the nonmedical health ratio, which does factor in some of the improvements around dental that you mentioned as well.
Tom Gallagher: Gotcha. So, like, a point better is a reasonable base case?
Ramy Tadros: Midpoint of the range is where we point to. So I think that's where I would start. Yep.
Tom Gallagher: Good. And just for a follow-up, John McCallion, just on raising alternative return assumptions for 2025, what's the thought process there? Is it, you know, just general market performance, do you have some line of visibility into Q1? Because, obviously, you haven't met any of the lower quarterly expectations for 2024. So curious why raise it now?
John McCallion: Yeah. Good morning, Tom. Yeah. So there's two components there in VII. We have our private equity, LP investments, and then we have some real estate and other funds. I think on the private equity, obviously, is a much bigger proportion as you saw on the slide in terms of average assets. So we have a few things going on. Obviously, there's been a tailwind with public equity markets. That has been the case. It hasn't really shown itself in the private market yet, but we think that is still, you know, beneficial. You know, our sense is that the underlying operating companies are benefiting from that. You're starting to sense an increase in exit activity beginning. So, like, the backlog is starting to remove or get better. I think there's probably a more accommodating regulatory and business-friendly environment ahead of us. So I think there's a number of positive backdrops that lead you to, you know, kind of our view for private equity. You know, the private equity returns for the year, they actually weren't far off. If not, they might have been actually on target relative to the guidance we gave last year. So we're really just kind of moving it up a point. So that takes the big, I'll say, the majority of the VII balance. Then you're left with real estate and other, and that asset class probably underperformed our expectation last year. But, you know, we're starting to see and you're hearing there's some, you know, bit of optimism beginning in the real estate market. It's showing signs of stabilizing. And so our view is that we're going to start to see recovery in values in 2025. So those combined factors there give us a view that next year will be better than this year. We still think that there'll be a gradual improvement throughout the year, so we don't think you get in the first quarter to call it the run rate or divide $1.7 billion by four. We think it's still lower, but we think we're above where we were here in the fourth quarter. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of our thinking.
Tom Gallagher: That does. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Great. Thanks. I wanted to go to the RIS spread guidance. If I look at the 110 to 135, it looks like, excuse me, that might be five basis points below what you originally guided to for 2024. But you've taken your VII up, and I thought you said core spreads were supposed to be stable. So I'm just trying to understand what would explain that delta if I'm remembering correctly.
John McCallion: Hey. Good morning, Suneet. It's John. So let me try to let me give you my maybe way of thinking about it, and I'll come back to your specific question of the relative to the last year's guidance. So we ended this fourth quarter at 112, which was up six basis points sequentially. We're flat on the core spread at 108. And then as we look ahead, you know, our view is that we expect 2025 total spread to be, like, as we said, 110 to 135. If you take the midpoint of that, it's actually above the 2024 actual spread that we ended with. Right? So what's doing that? So you see a bit of recovery in VII being forecasted, coupled with stabilizing core spreads in, you know, in 2025. So, you know, all of the interest rate caps have rolled off. Is one of the things that, you know, started to depress core spreads during the course of 2024. Those hedges, you know, performed as intended, which was to protect us from a sharp rise of interest rates in an inverted curve. And so now we think of core spreads stabilizing into 2025. And quite honestly, for the near term. And we typically are pretty hesitant about talking about more than one year. But I think we're starting to see, you know, I think, you know, in a steepening the curve will be positive eventually. It could have a little pressure on us in the near term as we, you know, reposition some of the portfolio. It also gives us the ability to implement other tools that we have. So, you know, maybe there's a few points of, you know, one or two-point pressure in 2025 relative to the 108. But we think quickly, you know, kind of reverts back to that. So, you know, you think of, like, the 106 to 108 over the near term is a pretty good sense of what our core spread we're you're going to see a lot more stability in the spread as we go forward. And especially as we put on new business, you know, they tend to be accretive now to spread as well. So, again, it's I think it's a very positive backdrop, but that maybe helps try to reconcile. I think relative to last year, I think the biggest probably delta is just the roll-off of the interest rate caps relative to this year.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. That makes sense. Excuse me. And then on Cherry Tree, can you just talk about what sort of block of business you'd be interested in using that vehicle for? Is it PRT? Is it sort of retail annuities? Can you use it domestically and internationally? Just some color about the scope of what you're thinking there would be helpful. Thanks.
Michel Khalaf: Sure. Good morning, Suneet. It's Michel. So just taking a step back, let me just say we're very pleased with the progress we're making here and really excited about the growth opportunities that Cherry Tree will allow us to capture. And, you know, keep in mind, we've been at work on this with our partner, General Atlantic, for less than a year. So we're continuing to move at pace to fully capitalize on operationalize the company. And, again, the intention here is to create a long-term strategic partnership with Cherry Tree. You know, as we mentioned at Investor Day, you know, really, this is intended to enhance our capital flexibility and to allow us to generate additional liability growth beyond our balance sheet capacity if need be. You know? And the other aspect to this is that it will allow us to convert this additional growth into high-value earnings for MIM as well. You know, I think we said also that, you know, the intention here is that for the first few years, the liabilities will be sourced through MetLife, Inc. But, you know, the possibility does exist that down the road, Cherry Tree may reinsure liabilities from third parties as well. And, you know, the liabilities sourced through MetLife, Inc., you know, includes sort of, you know, PRT and other liabilities sourced by RIS as well as potentially Japan liabilities. So, hopefully, this gives you a bit of color.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott: Hey. Good morning. First one I had is actually on MetLife Investment Management. You know, I'm sure you saw there were news articles suggesting that maybe Brighthouse Financial would, you know, potentially look to sell itself. And I'm not asking you to opine on that, but what I'm more interested in is if you could, you know, frame for us, you know, what kind of impact you could potentially have in MetLife Investment Management if, you know, an asset manager, you know, one of these private equity-backed companies engaged there, and were, you know, interested in managing general account. You know, how would that affect, you know, potentially your positioning? Like, how much money do you make up their general account management, etcetera?
John McCallion: Hey, Alex. Good morning. It's John. I think the first thing is we don't comment on specific client P&Ls. So won't get that out of me today, but look, they're an excellent customer and client of ours. We take pride in the fact that we have them as a customer and particularly given our historical relationship and the historical and personal relationships we all have. I think it's a, you know, it's a prized client for us and, you know, we really value it. We've read the papers as well and heard that as well. And so look, we've had other situations over time occur. We think we'd offer a unique value proposition and provide some, you know, unique capabilities that's what we've been building here in MetLife Investment Management. We continue to do that. We're looking to grow our capabilities, and you saw that most recently in some of the announcements that we made. So we think we have a unique offering. Having said that, we recognize that, you know, things can change over time and, you know, we think we're well-diversified, you know, client base. And, you know, we'll have to manage things as they come, but we are pretty excited about, you know, the things that we have to offer.
Alex Scott: Got it. I totally understand. Second one, maybe on capital deployment. You know, holdco cash in a really strong spot. Be interested too, though, if you could comment at all about how much capital is behind, you know, statutory capital is behind the holdings business at this point. And how to think about, you know, if you did find opportunities there, how that could add to the capital flexibility you have. And then, you know, ultimately, you know, are there areas that you look to add to in terms of inorganic activity?
John McCallion: Yeah. Hey, Alex. It's John. It's probably a little bit of a too broad of a question for us to answer. I think as we've talked about, we are very effective at managing MetLife Holdings. At the same time, we take a very, you know, we have a third-party view and talk to third parties to see if there's an opportunity for, you know, kind of something that makes sense that's accretive to our firm from a risk-adjusted basis. There's a lot of different variables and factors that go into the outcomes or the items that drive value creation. So probably a little hard to kind of give that broad answer. Also, you have to consider the diversification benefits we have to consider as well and things like that. So at the end of the day, it's been performing very well for us. When we think there's an opportunity, you've seen us take action. If not, there's no burning platform for us, and we're happy to manage this, you know, effectively ourselves. We think we have the unique capabilities to do that.
Alex Scott: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wes Carmichael with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Wes Carmichael: Hey, good morning. Thank you. And maybe just following up on the last question and maybe a little bit less broad, but particularly on long-term care and haven't gotten a lot of attention lately. But I think last quarter, you made some comments on the risk transfer market that seemed somewhat constructive. And I'm just curious if there's any further developments there in terms of pricing or bid-ask. And just maybe if I think about that block in particular, how does long-term care kind of flow into the free cash flow conversion ratio for the company? Because I know a lot of the off and holding has a pretty high cash flow profile.
Ramy Tadros: Hey. Good morning. It's Ramy here. Look. Like we talked about last quarter, we are seeing more activity in that risk transfer market, and when deals get announced, it means you're getting more convergence between cedents and reinsurers, and that's encouraging. Having said that, you know, these are always complex transactions to execute. They take time. Our objectives for any risk transfer deal are always the same. We want to maximize shareholder value and continue to serve our customers, and from the former, price matters for these deals, and so does structure. But in the interim, specific to our book, I would say it's well-capitalized, well-reserved. Recall, we are under the New York DFS reserving standards. We're held to a higher bar here. The book is well-managed. It's performing in line with our expectations. And we continue to have a really successful rate action program that's allowing us to kind of obtain the necessary premium increases and continue to provide coverage. So that's kind of a bit of an update in terms of where we stand, and I'll let John talk about the free cash flow piece of it.
John McCallion: Yeah. Sure. You know, it is a block of business that is growing its liabilities over time still, so it has not reached peak. So at the end of the day, it's actually not providing much in the way of cash flow these days, if any. It continues to strain, just given you have to grow, you're continuing to grow liabilities to the peak. So, hopefully, that helps.
Wes Carmichael: No. It does. Thank you. Thank you very much. And my second question was just on the positive trends in group life that you mentioned. That may persist through 2025. Can you provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing recently? And could this be something that persists a little bit longer term?
Ramy Tadros: Hey. Good morning. It's Ramy here. If you look at the public data and the recent trends in the CDC population data, in particular, for the working-age population, you see favorability in that data year-over-year. And given our size and diversification, that favorability in the population data is working its way into our ratios here. And that's probably the major driver as to why we came below the lower end of our range for 2024. We're still watching it. I think I would say if the positive trends that we have seen in terms of population mortality continue, and continue into, say, the first half of 2025, we would expect that for the full year, we would be in the bottom half of our guidance range on the mortality ratio as John alluded to. So very much population data-driven and without capability working into our numbers.
Wes Carmichael: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hey. Good morning. I just had a couple of questions. The first one is on commercial real estate. And if we look at your portfolio, your metrics are fairly stable, although they've been getting slightly worse over the last few quarters both on the coverage ratio and on loan to value, but not materially. So how should we think about losses coming in from that over the course of the year, and has the market stabilized, or do you think there's more pain to go through as you go through this year? And then secondly, on pension reform in Latin America, there's been a lot of concern about the Chilean market, and it comes and goes. But I think recently, there have been even some reports about potential nationalization of some of the ESP businesses, just wondering if you have any insights on what is going on there.
John McCallion: Yeah. Thanks, Jimmy. It's John. Good morning. On the commercial mortgage front in the market, as you know, we all know, there's been some recent pressure over the last few years, but I think the backdrop is starting to build some, you know, kind of optimism for going forward. Obviously, there's been strong economic growth that continues to remain healthy. And, you know, you start to see some even some real estate fundamentals beginning even in office. It's showing signs of bottoming. It's still probably not quite there yet, but it's showing signs. Office vacancies likely peaked most in 2024. You see the remote work starting to reverse. You see lease signings have been increasing, and so, you know, all in all, and then you couple that with, like, a low construction pipeline. All of that starts to, you know, give itself the ability to start to make a shift in terms of, you know, where things are. I think even vacancy rates across other properties are at historical averages, if not below. And then last thing I'd highlight is you're beginning to see signs of transaction volumes pick up. Even, you know, us, I think we had an $80 million level of or $90 million of gains this quarter on sales. So you're starting to see transactions. So, look, you know, as we look forward, we think we've, you know, we're approaching the peak of the cycle. Or trough, whichever way you want to put it. And so we think from an LTV perspective, we probably have hit our point. Maybe, you know, maybe there's a little more change, but I think we've kind of hit it in terms of LTVs. And, you know, looking forward, you know, in terms of losses, we've pretty, I would say we've effectively reserved for the most part, if not all, for losses. So right now, it's just kind of getting to the kind of the end of letting the dust settle. Probably the best way to think about what's left is we probably, you know, we might have a point or two of RBC. That's maybe a better way to kind of size what this means as opposed to maybe charge-offs or losses because we probably have been fully reserved now. And all else equal, obviously. And so once all the dust settles, maybe there's another point or two on average in terms of, you know, the impact of the cycle. That's how I put it.
Eric Sacha Clurfain: Hi, Jimmy. Regarding the Chile pension reform. So, yeah, you're right. After, you know, almost a decade of debate, a pension reform was approved last week by the Chilean congress. So now with this recent development, basically, we have more clarity on what's next. And, you know, in a nutshell, the key takeaways from this reform are threefold. One, the private pension system continues in its current structure with a few adjustments. The second is that employer contributions will be gradually increased over time. And the third is in terms of implementation, the reform will be gradual and take several years. So some elements of the law will require us to adapt our operations over time. And, you know, we don't foresee any material impact to our business that we wouldn't be able to mitigate. And we continue to remain very much committed to providing high-quality pension management services to our customers as we navigate these changes over time.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: Due to time constraints, our last question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on MIM. I know that's included within corporate, and John, I know in December, you told us you guys would start breaking it out right this year. Could you give us a sense of how much earnings MIM contributed in 2024? And the growth that you're expecting in MIM in 2025 within your guide?
John McCallion: Good morning, Elyse. Look. We'll do all that when we start to break out the segment. The way I would and the reason why I hesitate to start doing that now is, you know, what we try to do today was provide you the outlook based on our current state. And as you just said, MIM is incorporated in that. So it's spread out. So I'm reluctant to kind of throw out a number that then creates other confusion. So I think for modeling purposes, I would stick to kind of the segmentation that we have today. As we said at investor day, we expect to report MIM as a segment in 2025. But in light of the recent announcement with PineBridge, we are now aiming to do that to coincide with the closing of the transaction. And, you know, thank John Hall. He said that you worked very hard, all of you, and that we wanted to make it easier for you to do all your model changes. So that was a can thank him in due time. So expect the timing of the close to be in the second half of 2025. We have a number of regulatory approvals that we have to get done, but the team is working intensely to get those completed. So that would be our, you know, timing of when we give more info on that.
Elyse Greenspan: And then one last quick one. It sounds like you guys are using the forward curve, right, for some of the currency assumptions within the guide. I'm just trying to get a sense, like, if there is upside or, you know, even downside risk to some of the international earnings, you know, currency moves during 2025.
John McCallion: Yeah. That's correct, Elyse. We tend to just lock in on the 12/31 forward curves. And, you know, I think the places where we're seeing the most change over the last three months is primarily Latin America. You saw that mostly throughout the fourth quarter happen. So the average for the year is really kind of pressured there. I think from here, we see maybe a little more weakening from the spot rate. So I think at the end of 2025, it's somewhere a little above 21, where we're maybe hovering in the twenties today. And then also Asia, as well. So we use a forward curve. I think we're in the, you know, like, the yen today is in the 154 range or so, something like that, and we think the forward curve says the spot rate will be in the low fifties, somewhere around there. So there's a, I think on average, there's a little pressure if you take the average for the year, so it's a little bit of a headwind. As well as some of the other Asian currencies. So, hopefully, that helps.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to John Hall for closing remarks.
John Hall: Thanks, everyone, for joining us. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-31 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife’s SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, all. We appreciate you joining MetLife's third quarter 2024 earnings call. Before we begin, I point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of senior management are also available to participate. We released our supplemental slides last night and they are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features disclosures, GAAP reconciliations, and other information for your review. Q&A will follow prepared remarks and will end just before the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. On to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, MetLife reported third quarter results, which while absorbing pressure on variable investment income, affirmed the financial attractiveness of our businesses. Taking a wider view, year-to-date adjusted earnings per share excluding notable items are up 12%, pointing to our broader based momentum and a favorable underlying environment for our global set of market leading businesses. In the U.S, unemployment remains at historically low levels, inflation appears to be under control and the yield curve has started to see a positive slope beyond two years. These are conditions that favor both our Group Benefits and our Retirement and Income Solutions businesses. Outside the U.S, we are seeing a promising backdrop for many of our key markets. For instance, in Japan, the combination of modest inflation, the 10-year JGB near 1% and government incentives to save has the potential to put money in motion moving from the sidelines and into the investment and insurance products MetLife offers. Elsewhere around the world, in Mexico, near-shoring activities can put more people to work and at higher wages, which is good for the Mexican economy as well as for our business there. While in Brazil, the rapid adoption of digital distribution channels for financial products is democratizing financial services and bringing them to a wider audience of customers. Still, the geopolitical conditions that persist in many regions remain challenging and we have an election here in the U.S. next week. Yet throughout its 156-year history, MetLife has successfully managed risk and found opportunity in uncertain times. Our purpose always with you, building a more confident future resonates at times like these, and I have every confidence that MetLife will continue to create value for our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders going forward. Turning to the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.95 per share. After reflecting net positive notable items from our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.93 per share. Recurring interest margins, underwriting and foreign currency exchange rates were all less favorable than a year ago, partially offset by volume growth and higher equity markets. As we had previously indicated, private equity returns came in below expectations leading variable investment income or VII to dip under the prior year period results. At the same time, real estate and other fund returns improved sequentially, extending the trend we've seen develop through the year. In the quarter, our key performance metrics reflect the power of our business. MetLife posted a 14.6% adjusted return on equity and we are on track to exceed our 13% to 15% target range for the full year. This further demonstrates our focus on deploying capital to generate responsible growth and high returns. And our efficiency mindset was evident in MetLife's third quarter direct expense ratio of 11.7%, an improvement year-over-year and below our 12.3% annual target. Shifting to business segment results. Our Group Benefits business reported adjusted earnings of $431 million excluding notable items, down from a strong underwriting quarter a year ago. On a year-to-date basis also excluding notable items adjusted earnings are up 7%. Our scale and broad product range have long been points of competitive differentiation for our Group Benefits business, contributing to our adjusted premiums, fees and other revenue growth. In the quarter, adjusted PFOs, excluding the [Technical Difficulty] policies, rose 5.3%. For the year-to-date period, adjusted PFOs on the same basis similarly grew 5.5%. With employee benefits enrollment season again upon us, this year, more than 1 million U.S. employees will be able to make their enrollment experiences easier by using MetLife's Upwise, a newly developed tool to help them choose and use their benefits. Upwise simplifies benefits selection by making custom recommendations based on an employee's individual needs and preferences. And Upwise is important because our research shows that more informed benefit selection decisions lead to a more engaged and productive workforce, a win for employees and employers. Moving to Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, totaled $368 million in the quarter, reflecting the impact of interest rate caps maturing. Sales of stable value and U.K. longevity reinsurance remains strong, and we maintain our leadership position in the competitive jumbo pension risk transfer space. With a strong start to the fourth quarter, we've now closed $5.6 billion of PRT sales so far in 2024. We published our annual pension risk transfer poll last month, which continues to point to a robust pension risk transfer pipeline. The 2024 poll found that among companies with defined benefit pension derisking goals, a full 93% intend to completely divest their plans, up from 89% in the 2023 poll. Moreover, about half of these companies plan to divest in the next two to five years. Turning to Asia. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $347 million, down 6% from the year ago quarter on market-related items, partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings grew 16%. Asia's general account assets under management, a key measure for this region, grew 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Looking to Latin America. We saw strong bottom-line results with adjusted earnings excluding notable items of $217 million, rising 9% from a year ago. On a constant currency basis, sales and adjusted PFOs both grew double digits. Our momentum in Latin America has been building for some time. This can be seen in Brazil, where we have seized upon the growing adoption of digital distribution of financial sales to partner with some of the leading players in that market. To capture this opportunity, we have deployed an integrated technology solution called Accelerator, which allows us to meet customers where they are. MetLife Accelerator helps leading banks, retailers and other companies offer insurance to our customers with a simple, frictionless and fully digital insurance experience. Starting in Brazil. We branched out to bring this innovative technology to other core markets in Latin America, including Mexico and Chile with more than 4 million in-force customers in the region since launching a year ago. For some time now, we have spoken to the importance of value of new business as a critical management tool. Our focus and the intensity of our execution across this metric is impressive. For 2023, we generated a 19% internal rate of return on $3.6 billion of capital deployed, creating VNB of $2.6 billion with a payback period of roughly five years. It is even more impressive when you consider the substantial progress we've made over the course of the Next Horizon time frame, a 400 basis point increase in IRR and a two-year decrease in payback period, all of which adds up to more cash sooner. As you can see from our VNB numbers, MetLife prioritizes organic growth with attractive payback periods and internal rates of return. We also favor strategic inorganic growth with similar financial characteristics. When appropriate organic and inorganic opportunities are not available, we will return capital to shareholders via share repurchase while also generating attractive IRRs. Our track record proves this out. In the third quarter, we were again active in capital management and returned close to $1.2 billion to shareholders via common stock dividends and share repurchase. We distributed common stock dividends of roughly $400 million and bought back approximately $800 million of our common shares. This brings total common stock repurchase through the third quarter to about $2.8 billion. We still have more than $2 billion remaining on our Board authorization. Finally, at the end of the third quarter, we had $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. To wrap up, we are moving closer to our December 12 Investor Day, where we are excited to roll out our next five-year strategy, New Frontier. As I have mentioned, New Frontier is not a radical change in direction for MetLife. Rather, it takes us to places where we have the right to win. It is a growth platform that builds on the success of Next Horizon and provides a pathway to lead MetLife to even stronger performance in the future. We are in a much different position than we were five years ago, more front-footed and oriented towards offense versus defense. I look forward to expanding on the precepts of New Frontier, which are anchored on accelerating growth, boosting returns and fostering greater consistency. Now, I'll turn it over to John to cover our quarterly performance in more detail.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll start with the 3Q '24 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, including details of our annual global actuarial assumption review. In addition, I'll provide updates on our value of new business metrics and our liquidity and capital position. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net income was $1.3 billion, $100 million lower than adjusted earnings. We had net derivative gains primarily due to the strengthening of the yen versus the U.S. dollar and the decline in interest rates in the third quarter. That said, derivative gains were partially offset by market risk benefit, or MRB, remeasurement losses due to lower interest rates. Net investment losses were modest, reflecting normal trading activity and a continuation of a stable credit environment. Overall, the investment portfolio remains high quality and resilient and our hedging program performed as expected. The table on Page 4 provides highlights of our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments with the breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by segment. Overall, the impact to adjusted earnings and net income was modest. In Group Benefits, we had an unfavorable impact due to a liability refinement related to an annuity payout feature on a small subset of our Group Life portfolio. There is no ongoing impact due to this refinement. In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, while we have maintained our long-term mortality trend assumption consistent with pre-COVID. This reflects the impact of higher mortality over the last few years, which resulted in a positive impact to adjusted earnings. And in Asia, the net unfavorable impact was primarily due to three factors: unfavorable changes to lapsed assumptions across life and accident health products in Japan; lower expected fund returns for variable life products in Korea; and these were partially offset by a positive impact from improved morbidity for accident and health products in Japan and Korea. On Page 5, you can see the third quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. Adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion, down 8% and 6% on a constant currency basis primarily due to lower recurring interest margins, partially offset by solid volume growth year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.93, down 1% on a reported basis but up 1% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $431 million, down 11% year-over-year, primarily due to less favorable non-medical health underwriting margins versus a strong comparison in Q3 of '23. The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.6% and 82.4% when excluding the notable items discussed earlier. This was below our annual target of 84% to 89%. Our mortality results remain seasonally strong, albeit following record-low life claims in 2Q of '24. Year-to-date, our Group Life mortality ratio remained at the low end of our annual target range, although we would expect the ratio to be toward the middle of the range in the fourth quarter. Regarding nonmedical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 72.4% in the quarter, within our annual target range of 69% to 70% but higher than the prior year quarter of 69% or 70.4% excluding a favorable notable item related to disability in 3Q of '23. Turning to the top line. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 5% year-over-year and at the midpoint of our 2024 target growth range of 4% to 6%. Group Benefits year-to-date sales were up 9% driven by strong growth in national accounts. RIS adjusted earnings were $368 million, down 10% versus the prior year. Lower recurring interest margins were partially offset by strong volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. RIS total investment spreads were 106 basis points, down 15 basis points sequentially mainly due to the continued expiration of interest rate caps and lower variable investment income. As we highlighted in the Q2 earnings call, the continued roll-off of the interest rate caps drove the majority of the sequential decline. Given the vast majority of interest caps have expired and based on the current forward interest rate curve, we expect fourth quarter spreads, excluding variable investment income, to now stabilize and be flat to up 1 to 2 basis points. RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were up 3% year-over-year primarily driven by strong sales in U.K. longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we continue to see an active market. We had premiums of approximately $500 million in the third quarter, and we have already seen a strong start to Q4 with over $1.5 billion in PRT wins in the past month alone. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $347 million, down 6% and 5% on a constant currency basis primarily due to market-related items in the quarter, partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. For Asia's growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were down 1% on a constant currency basis. Lower Japan sales were mostly offset by other Asian markets, which were up 10%, most notably due to strong growth in India and China. In Japan, sales were down 7% year-over-year primarily due to the impact of yen volatility on foreign currency products. However, we continue to see a favorable outlook given higher interest rates and positive macro changes in Japan. For example, our refreshed yen-denominated variable life and cancer products introduced earlier this year have been well. Latin America adjusted earnings were $217 million, up 9% and 21% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by strong Chilean encaje returns in the quarter and volume growth in our key markets. Latin America's top line also continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 1% and 11% on a constant currency basis driven by strong sales and solid persistency across the region. Turning to EMEA. Adjusted earnings were $75 million, up 7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by strong volume growth year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 11% and 14% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region, and sales were up 32% on a constant currency basis primarily from Turkey and Egypt. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $170 million, down 17% versus the prior year quarter. The primary driver was the foregone earnings due to the reinsurance transaction that closed in November of 2023. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $249 million versus an adjusted loss of $262 million in the prior year. The Company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 24% and within our 2024 guidance range of 24% to 26%. On Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the prior five quarters, including $162 million in Q3 of '24. This was down $17 million versus Q3 of '23. The private equity portfolio, which had over $14 billion in VII assets as of September 30 had a positive 0.6% return in the quarter. This compared to a 1.4% return in Q3 of '23. While PE returns were below recent trends, our real estate-related and other funds of roughly $4.5 billion continued to improve with a 1.1% return in the quarter. As a reminder, PE, real estate-related and other funds are reported on a one-quarter lag and accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the last four quarters and the third quarter of '24. As you can see in the chart, RIS, Asia and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile. Now turning to Page 8. The chart on the left of the page illustrates the split of our adjusted net investment income between recurring and VII for the last three years, including third quarter of 2023 and '24. Adjusted net investment income in Q3 of '24 was essentially flat versus the prior year. While recurring investment income has benefited from asset growth and higher interest rates, it has been offset by the roll-off of interest rate caps. Turning your attention to the right side of the page. This shows our new money rate versus roll-off yield since the third quarter of '21. Over the last 10 quarters, new money yields have outpaced roll-off yields, consistent with higher interest rates. In Q3 of '24, our global new money rate achieved a yield of 6%, 22 basis points higher than the roll-off rate. The narrowing of the spread between new money rates and roll-off yields in 3Q was primarily due to a roughly 70 basis point decline in U.S. interest rates and elevated pay downs in the quarter of recently purchased higher-yield securities. That said, the proceeds from these pay downs in 3Q have been reinvested in high relative value public and private assets with similar yields. I would also note that the new money rate-related purchases in 3Q of roughly $14 billion, more than twice that of the invested assets rolling off. So, while the difference between our new money rates and roll-off yields shown here is as an indicative metric for future investment margin impact, it's only directional in nature and not a perfect depiction of spread impacts. At these levels, we continue to see positive impact of higher yields on our in-force and new business growth. Now moving to expenses on Page 9. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for the full year of 2023 of 12.2% and the first three quarters to '24 all below 12%, including 11.7% in Q3 of '24. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q3 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. Looking ahead, we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in the fourth quarter, consistent with the seasonal nature of our business. That said, our performance year-to-date positions us to beat our full year 2024 direct expense ratio target of 12.3%, demonstrating our consistent execution and a sustained efficiency mindset. Now let's turn to Page 10. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past five years, including an update for 2023. MetLife invested $3.6 billion of capital in 2023 to support new business. This was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 19% with a payback period of five years, generating roughly $2.6 billion in value. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $4.5 billion at September 30, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. Cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend and share repurchases of roughly $800 million in the third quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $130 million in October. For our U.S. companies, preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2024 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.8 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while net income was approximately $2 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.6 billion as of September 30, 2024, down 2% from June 30, 2024 primarily due to dividends paid and derivative losses, partially offset by operating earnings. Finally, we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 745% as of September 30, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Before I wrap up, I would just like to highlight that we have an updated commercial mortgage loan slide as of September 30 in the appendix. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform as expected with attractive loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios as well as the expectation of modest losses. In summary, while adjusted earnings were below our expectations primarily due to lower VII, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals was evident with strong top line growth, disciplined underwriting and prudent expense management. In addition, our strong value of new business metrics demonstrates our disciplined approach to deploying capital to its highest and best use, consistent with our all-weather strategy. MetLife remains in a position of strength given our balance sheet, free cash flow generation and diversification of our market-leading businesses, and we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and building sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. Finally, let me close by saying that we look forward to seeing many of you on December 12 at our Investor Day, which will focus on the introduction of our New Frontier strategy. As we have in the past several years, we will be offering our near-term outlook in early February as part of our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Suneet Kamath: I wanted to start with Group Benefits, if I could. I know your adjusted loss ratios are within your guide, but maybe a little bit higher than they've been tracking recently. So, can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about pricing in that business, particularly in dental, where I think you've seen some pressure? And maybe some comments on the competitive environment as well?
Ramy Tadros: Suneet, maybe I'll start with the competitive environment. I would reiterate we're not really seeing any change in the competitive environment in group. The market has been competitive, remains competitive. But having said that, we always did note that the pricing perspective is not an irrational market and the short-term nature of the products that we sell, in particular, also dental, means that any aggressive pricing will shop fairly quickly in earnings, which acts as a kind of a natural check on any irrational pricing. So, the headline for you here, yes, it's competitive, not irrational. And we do see kind of a competitive environment. That also extends beyond price as we've also talked about before in terms of capabilities, digital experiences, breadth of product and what have you. From a ratio perspective, I'll start with life. We're particularly pleased with the life ratio this quarter. It is still below our lower end of our guidance range once you kind of take that notable piece out. And we're benefiting from favorable incidents in the population, and you continue to see that in the CDC population data for the working age population. So, if you look at that life ratio year-to-date, we're at 83.9%. And even if you were to factor in a seasonally higher Q4 on the life side, we would still be close to the bottom end of the range for life. And then finally, moving on to the nonmedical health ratio. We're also within the range, as you pointed. We did have a number of smaller items in the nonmedical health ratio, which were unfavorable to the ratio. Those were worth about a point. So, if you take that out, it would bring us right back in the middle of that range. Then with respect to dental in particular, I did talk about the competitive environment. And we also did talk in the past about a market that's trending back to pre-pandemic seasonality and utilization levels. And we have seen these dynamics play out, and we have been taking actions in terms of pricing. So, think of that as really part and parcel of how we manage our dental block through cycles. The critical point I would make here is going forward, it's really about ability to reprice and maintain persistency. We can reprice about 80% of that business in any given year. So, while this quarter was higher than our seasonal expectations, our pricing for 1/1 reflects these dynamics. And we feel really good about returning back to our target margins for the block in 2025.
Suneet Kamath: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, for either Michel or John, on the VNB slide, can you just talk a little bit about what's driving the improvement in the IRR and the reduction in the payback period? And have you sort of back-tested these IRRs? Because I'm assuming they're sort of pricing IRRs. And so, when you look at how these blocks have actually developed -- are they pretty close to your pricing assumptions? Or can you just give us some color on that?
Michel Khalaf: Sure. Thanks, Suneet. I'll start and then I'll let John add some color as well. So really pleased with the journey we've been on here in terms of -- one of our main pillars for Next Horizon was the focus pillar, which is allocating capital to its highest and best use. And I think that's reflected in how we allocate capital in support of organic growth, of new business growth. And if you think about sort of the trajectory we've been on here, think about Group Benefits, Lat Am, two of our higher-return businesses, continuing to show really strong growth there. So that's certainly a contributing factor. We're not getting 19%, I would say, across all of our businesses, but the fact that we have businesses with higher returns growing faster than some of the other businesses, that's certainly contributing to the VNB picture you see on our slide.
John McCallion: Yes. And Suneet, I think your -- it's a good question, the point around just back testing because as you said, this is -- these are IRRs on new business that we've priced based on our best estimate assumptions. And I think -- I have been thinking about that as well. And I think there's a couple of things. Certainly, the environment has been favorable here, right? I mean, in the case of -- if you just think about -- we've been in benign credit environment. Underwriting has generally been in line across our businesses and interest rates have been favorable. So, all of those -- so I think the answer is yes, it's hard to be really precise, give or take, on all of those things. But we think about -- we've asked the same question ourselves because, obviously, we're seeing the positive momentum here. And I think, just thinking a little more about the positive momentum, like Michel said, mix of business is certainly a driver there in terms of our new business. Two, I think the tool itself as a management tool has -- causes everyone to continue to refine things in terms of pricing, capital optimization, how you might use reinsurance. We did get some favorable regulatory changes. Like in Korea, for example, they've moved to an economic framework recently, typically favors up because we tend to follow an economic framework. So that has ultimately given us a lot more excess capital there that will over time be redistributed up into the holding company. And then, I think the third thing is there's been a trend of unit cost improvement there. So, I think all of those factors give rise to why you see this kind of migration occurring. And I think probably the biggest one is what Michel said, which is mix of business, you have high growth in -- certainly in some of our businesses that have had high IRRs from very low capital-intensive businesses like group and Latin America. So hopefully, it helps.
Suneet Kamath: It does. If I could just throw in one quick follow-up. These IRRs, I mean, I'm assuming, this would give us a directional indication of where your ROE is headed given that they're unlevered returns?
Michel Khalaf: Yes. I mean, I think that should give a good indication in terms of direction of traffic here, especially if you consider that besides what we just mentioned, the fact that MetLife Holdings, which is a low-ROE business, is running off. So, all of these factors combined, I think, would point to a ROE trending upwards.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jimmy Bhullar: I had a couple of questions. One was just on Japan sales. Should we assume that with the yen-dollar exchange rate moving around that Japan sales, especially dollar-denominated products, will stay weak in the near term? Or are there other sort of products that you're thinking about that should help mitigate the impact? And then secondly, on the portfolio, most of the metrics on your commercial real estate portfolio seems fairly stable with where they've been. But what are you seeing overall in the market? And do you think office and non-office, are they close to bottoming? And then there's been renewed concerns, I think, recently with the single asset, single borrower-type loans back in CMBS. And if you could just give some numbers on your exposure to those.
Lyndon Oliver: Great. Jimmy, it's Lyndon here. Let me take the Japan question. So, let's start with Japan sales, and I'll give you some color on overall Asia. Look, Japan is an attractive market. Look, we're seeing increasing interest rates as well as positive macro trends there. And what we are seeing is an overall environment for FX products that has become more competitive. If you look at Japan sales, they were lower year-over-year in single premium FX products. Now a few reasons. We face a tough comparative against last year. Sales in '23 for the full year were up 14% year-over-year. And then, as you said, while the yen has strengthened in the quarter, we do see continued volatility of FX markets, and that has impacted the sales of foreign currency products. So essentially, what we're seeing are more customers staying on the sideline during these periods of FX volatility. Japan sales for the third quarter sequentially were in line with where they were for the second quarter. Now we do have a diversified portfolio. We have both U.S. dollar as well as yen products in Japan. And we continue to evolve this product portfolio to maintain competitiveness. So, we've introduced several new products. We launched a refreshed yen-denominated variable life product. We've launched a cancer product earlier this year. Both products have performed very well. We've also launched a refreshed A&H medical product this month, and we're planning to launch a new U.S. dollar life product early next year. If we look at the rest of Asia, what we're seeing, our sales have gone up 9% year-over-year, and that's driven primarily from China and India. Solid performance in China, especially as we look across both our channels, bancassurance as well as agency. And if you look in India, we've seen sales increase sharply there with strong growth across all our channels. As far as an outlook goes, look, year-to-date sales have been in line with the prior year, and we expect full year sales for Asia to be close to flat year-over-year.
John McCallion: Jimmy, I'll take your commercial mortgage comment or question. As you pointed out, I think despite the recent pressure, we've kind of commented on a few factors, right? There's been continued -- economic growth has been healthy. That has been good news for fundamentals of real estate. There's some modest trend towards in-office or even office has some kind of backdrop momentum here. And overall, I think as you point out, we feel -- outside of office, we probably feel like we've kind of hit the trough, and we've probably seen a positive outlook. There's healthy fundamentals overall now for the economy. You have like some at least expectation of some declining interest rates. Even steepening of the curve, I think, would be a positive here. You're starting to see increasing transaction activity. Even us in this quarter, we probably -- I think we had five sales of real estate properties for a gain, about $120 million, $150 million of gain in the quarter. So again, we're just starting to see more liquidity come back into the market. So, we think -- overall, there is a positive backdrop that's starting to emerge. I don't think we're out of it. We're not going to see kind of a V-shape recovery per se, but it certainly is setting up for a more positive 2025 environment. I think you asked about single borrower. I don't have the exact number on CMBS, but it's relatively small. I think I'd just give you a few statistics. We have about $10 billion of CMBS. And of that, over 80% or about 80% of that is rated AAA or AA. But the single borrower exposure is relatively small. I just don't have that at my fingertips.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Your line is open.
Tom Gallagher: First, just a follow-up on Group Benefits. Ramy, I think you mentioned, there were certain nonmedical health products that were elevated in the quarter. What were those -- outside of dental, can you -- what risks are those? Are those disability or something else? And is there a reason you would expect those to recover quickly? Or is there going to be some tail to those where you think those might remain elevated? And then also just on dental, how do you see that playing out? Is there -- does it take a year in terms of the way the repricing works versus the margin? Or is it quicker than that?
Ramy Tadros: Tom, thank you for the question. So, the one-timers were about one point in aggregate. So, think of them as -- the small items were about one point in aggregate. So, think of that as about $20 million post tax. And I would largely characterize them as one-timers. So, we've got some of -- small item on the reinsurance true-up, another item on timing of rate approvals. So, think of them as a collection of items that just all went against us in the quarter. Within the -- disability continues to perform very well for us, and we continue to see incidents in line with expectations. We continue to see strong recoveries in that line of business. So, that's a bit of a -- kind of some more color on those smaller items. But in aggregate, I would say, largely think of them as onetime in nature. With dental, we have been putting rate increases in the books since the beginning of the year. And as and when business comes up for renewal, these rate increases kind of will go into place. While we don't have complete visibility into 1/1, the visibility is pretty good at this point. And from what we're seeing so far, we are going to be back to our margin for the full year '25. So, this is not a multiyear issue. We're kind of towards the end of that cycle, and 1/1 would have us back to our target margin.
Tom Gallagher: Got you. And then just a question on risk transfer. A peer of yours recently said they looked into long-term care risk transfer, decided the pricing was too adverse, and they're moving on. They're not going to pursue anything beyond that. Curious if you've looked into that market and if you have, your view of it, do you share that view that the pricing is too onerous? Or is that something you might want to pursue?
Ramy Tadros: Tom, it's Ramy again here. While I can't comment on the specific of any peer. We continue to see activity in that market, I would say, increased activity, in particular over the last 12 months. And I would say, the bid-ask spreads are somewhat narrowing, which is, I think, encouraging as we think about our book and some of the bid-ask spreads that are out there. But as we've always said, our book is well capitalized, it's well managed. It continues to perform in line with expectations. So, we continue to assess risk transfer options. Clearly, any deal needs to create long-term shareholder value. So, price matters, structure matters here. But in general, I would say, active discussions and somewhat narrowing of bid-ask spreads there in terms of what we see.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is open.
Ryan Krueger: I had a question on RIS spreads. John, does your comment on the spreads stabilizing in the fourth quarter also translate into stable spreads in '25 as well based on the forward curve?
John McCallion: Ryan, good morning. Yes, and just as -- just to kind of rehash what I said, right, we had we had a little bit more of a decline this quarter relative to what we had called out in the second quarter of 8 to 10 basis points on the core spreads, and it came in around 11. So, I think a good reminder, which I didn't say in my opening remarks, is that in the second quarter, we said 8 to 10 would occur as well, and we came in under that. So, a little bit of each of those quarters are a function of just what rates did in the quarter. And this quarter, we had we had some lower rates during the quarter. Although as everyone has seen, rates have ticked up, which gives us a little bit of the -- kind of optimism to being flat to up a few basis points come fourth quarter. We'll give more color in the outlook call in February. I think that maybe the -- but I will say that we do feel like we've gotten to a more stable spread, maybe is the way I'd put it. But curve matters. So that will be an aspect of what we do in our outlook. So hesitant to kind of call it now. I think we'll wait and see where the curve is, and also the sensitivities can change and things like that, very dependent upon kind of the outlook of the curve. But all in all, we are seeing more stability now. And so, I think that's a fair assumption for now.
Ryan Krueger: And then do you have any early insight into fourth quarter variable investment income at this point?
John McCallion: I wish I could say yes, but probably -- I don't know if we have really good insights. I mean, look, at the end of the day, we probably have a -- we have a view. And I think the reality is that this portfolio in the sector of PE, they continue to adjust to higher rates and more volatile markets and a constrained set of exit options. That said, it was still positive returns this quarter. We also saw a positive rebound in the real estate and related funds there in the quarter, again, maybe referencing back to some of the comments I made earlier around kind of what we're seeing in real estate. And I think the other thing that I did call out, I think it was at your conference possibly, is that we had another $600 million of distributions occur. So, this is still giving a strong cash flow. I think performance has been good on a relative scale, I think, top -- kind of top half quartile -- top half performance, maybe second-quartile performance. In the quarter, when we went in and dug deep, we saw that there were probably a few one-off situations in certain funds in the quarter, where some of the funds had to mark a particular asset as opposed to broad marks across. We think that those are more one-off factors. So, if we were to normalize for them and use that as our proxy for the fourth quarter, you should think maybe total VII would be north of where we are today, maybe doesn't get us back to 2Q levels. So maybe you take the midpoint of those two as a good estimate for fourth quarter at this juncture.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Barclays. Your line is open.
Alex Scott: I just wanted to come back to some of the comments on RIS and maybe even more broadly across the firm. Could you talk about your sensitivity to interest rates? Maybe help us think through what kind of floating rate allocation you have and maybe net of floating rate liabilities and so forth? And would be interested in RIS specifically. The shape of the yield curve changing the way it has, is that a net positive, negative? I just want to get a better feel for rate exposure.
John McCallion: Alex, it's John, and welcome back. Yes, just as a framing, generally, for our portfolio is -- a steeper curve is better. So, we -- higher rates are better, steeper curve is better as well. So, I think that helps with maybe the direction of travel. In terms of like our floating rate assets to liabilities, we're pretty well matched. Sometimes, we have a little bit of floating rate assets in Corporate & Other. So that can be one place where you might see. But ultimately, a lower short end of the curve is better for us, and that's just how we typically manage our collective portfolio. So, I think the outlook slides we provided back in February of this year in terms of just parallel shifts in the curve are probably still pretty good proxies for the impact to our firm. But in terms of shape of the curve, I can probably just give you directional commentary at this juncture.
Alex Scott: Got it. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, as we think through the strategies that's on the come here in December and thinking through the comments that it should provide further enhancement to returns. Will that come more through revenue growth and growing some of the businesses with higher returns? Or are there further levers that you can pull to take down that expense ratio and drive efficiency across the organization?
Michel Khalaf: Alex, yes, I would say, it's a combination of continuing to grow high-return businesses, continue with the same discipline that we've -- that's now sort of -- really sort of a muscle that's very strong in the organization, I would say, in terms of how we price, how we bring product to market. And then to the point that John made earlier, our unit cost also has been coming down. So that's another contributing factor there. So, it's both of those things.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wilma Burdis from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Wilma Burdis: Could you walk us through what you see as a more normalized run rate level of earnings for both group and RIS?
John McCallion: Okay. I think, Wilma, I just want to make sure we were able to hear that. You just said, could you walk through more normalized earnings for group and RIS?
Wilma Burdis: Yes, yes, sorry.
John McCallion: No problem. Okay. I can just start at a high level, and then Ramy can add. I think, obviously, RIS has been impacted by the roll-off of our interest rate caps. And I'd say, we've provided some guidance on that actually in February, roughly 8 to 10 basis points a quarter. I would say, basically, hit that on the mark. We were a little lower in that roll off and impact in the second quarter, a little higher than the third. Net-net, we probably ended where we expected. And now, we'll see -- we should see some stabilization in those levels for the fourth quarter and on. And I think for RIS, you have to take into account VII, right? And if you think about our earnings this quarter, that's obviously a fairly large delta for us relative to what we think our underlying run rate is for the firm. I think for group, you have to be -- seasonality matters a lot. So, it depends on what quarter we're talking about. But I think, as Ramy pointed out in some of his remarks, that we did have a few things that just went against us this quarter. And I think that's the case also in Japan and others. And it's just one of those things where we've got a few things that we don't expect to recur. They just tend to all happen in one quarter, and they all were relatively small but added to some numbers that all went in one direction. So, that's kind of how we probably see the quarter at this juncture. And I know you only said RIS and group, but I thought I'd give you a more holistic view of that.
Wilma Burdis: Okay. And then just maybe related to an earlier question, but could you just talk about the economic environment that would be supportive of VII returning to more normal levels?
John McCallion: Sure. I think, as we were referencing earlier, certainly, higher interest rates have caused the sector to have to adjust, right? I mean it's been a sector that has benefited significantly from the lower-forever environment that no longer is forever. And so, as rates have risen, things have -- firms have had to shift back to kind of the growth model and -- as opposed to just the leverage model. And I think that was a strategy. I don't think it was wrong. It was just it was. And so, it's taking some time, coupled with the fact that the environment needs exit options and M&A or IPO activity, and that also has slowed a bit as a result of the broader macro environment. So, we think with the onetime, it's probably one factor that improves the sector. And the second is I think that as rates start to stabilize and probably the curve starts to stabilize more importantly, that will be kind of a positive aspect to support the sector.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
John Barnidge: My question is on real estate. Given the improved positivity in directionality and given it's more of a cycle asset class than anything else, do you think the recovery could be more extended in what goes into VII on a normalized basis post real estate recovery actually could end up being larger on the real estate side?
John McCallion: And John, just to make sure I have that, you're asking whether there could be a larger allocation as a result of maybe the outlook? Is that what you mean?
John Barnidge: No, not allocation. Just as the contribution to real estate in the third quarter of overall VII was larger than it was in the prior counters, as that cycle turns, should we actually think of that actually being larger possibly on the other side, not allocation.
John McCallion: I mean, we've given some outlook -- in our outlook, we gave some views of returns for the asset classes. And obviously, they were predicated on a certain set of assumptions. Not all those assumptions have come true, and they aren't -- and that's expected. I still think using that relative scaling, even if the returns kind of migrate up, is still a good concept. And if you think about our real estate exposure in VII today, it's more in the, call it, core, core plus and maybe some bit of opportunistic. So, in terms of the expected return on those types of investments, you would think they're lower than what you would be expecting for, say, a PE or a venture capital fund.
John Barnidge: That's very helpful. And then my other question, can you talk about the opportunity being opened up due to regulatory reform, not just in Korea but broadly in Asia? Could we be seeing more growth from those markets?
John McCallion: Yes. I think just my -- I'll just say quickly my comment on Korea, and I think you probably caught on to it is, we do tend to work better in a more economic framework because we tend to run our firm very much like that. Obviously, you have to manage to the statutory constraints in any jurisdiction, and so you can't ignore them. But we certainly spend a lot of time thinking about the economic nature of our business. And so, that's one thing we saw in Korea. And I'm not so sure it opens up the environment or for business outlook per se, but we certainly think it's more favorable for us, and it avoids having to manage too many different constraints.
Operator: Due to time constraints, we're going to have to cut the question-and-answer session short. I will now turn the call back over to John Hall for closing remarks.
John Hall: Great. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Have a happy Halloween, and we look forward to seeing you where we can on December 12. Bye.
Operator: Thank you. The meeting has now concluded. Thank you for joining, and have a pleasant day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, all. We appreciate you joining MetLife's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of senior management are also are also available to participate. We released our supplemental slides last night, and they are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information for your review. Q&A will follow prepared remarks, and we'll end just before the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. Now to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the second quarter results that we posted last night and believe the quarter clearly reflects MetLife's core strength, including the momentum across our businesses and greater predictability of our performance achieved through our consistent execution. The expectations we shared about our about our performance came to pass in the second, in line with our forecast, and in some cases, even better. After normal seasonal impacts in the first quarter, the performance of our flagship Group Benefits Group Benefits franchise shone through in the second quarter. Variable investment income, or VII, performed in line with the expectations we laid out in the first quarter, with the recovery in private equity returns partially offset by the performance of real estate funds, which saw significantly narrower losses in the second quarter. The broad diversification of our businesses has proven to be a fundamental strength for MetLife, creating many natural offsets and allowing us to generate growth while navigating the tides of shifting business and economic dynamics. And our ability to generate strong recurring cash flow, coupled with our discipline to apply capital to its highest and best use, enables us to drive sustained long-term value for our highest. In the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion or $2.28 per share, up 18% from the prior year. The strong result was driven by favorable underwriting, good volume growth and higher variable investment income led by the positive performance I just mentioned. In total, net income in the mentioned was $912 million, substantially higher than $370 million in the prior year period. Strong adjusted earnings growth, aided by our unwavering focus on execution, generated outstanding results measured by several of our key performance metrics. MetLife posted a 17.3% adjusted return on equity in the quarter, well above our target range of 13% to 15% and a powerful example of our ability to efficiently deploy quarter, and generate profitable growth for our shareholders. MetLife's direct expense ratio in the second quarter was 11.9%, an improvement year-over-year and below our 12.3% annual target. As we have noted before, the positive leverage in this ratio is not only a measure of our ability to control costs, but also our capacity to grow revenue at a grow revenue at a faster rate than expenses, and the second quarter, both top line growth and lower direct expenses were contributors to our excellent quarterly expense ratio. When we established our Next Horizon strategy almost five years ago, it was supported by the interconnected foundational pillars of focus, simplify and differentiate. Our success in executing against our focus pillar is evident in the high-teen internal rates of return we achieve on new business and our strong enterprise-wide return on equity. Similarly, our success in executing against our simplified pillar manifests in our improving expense ratio. Our drive to execute against our differentiated pillar is essentially funded by the success we've achieved through our focus and simplify pillars. When we activated Next Horizon, we committed to free up $1 billion of expense capacity to invest in growth initiatives and technology, and we have done so, matching both sides of this equation. This shows up in dozens of internal technology initiatives that are making it easier for customers to purchase our products, as well as for them to receive their benefit and retirement payments. We see our capacity to invest in technology at MetLife's scale as a true differentiator relative to our competitors, which we believe will only get more impactful over time. There are many tools in our toolbox that will help drive this advantage forward, including artificial intelligence, or AI. From our standpoint, we believe MetLife's large pool of pool of data puts us in an advantaged position with AI having the potential to act as a force multiplier and further widen the divide in our favor, yet this is not just future talk. AI has been part of our playbook at MetLife for years, and we are seeing many initiatives move -- to implementation to create seamless and personalized customer experiences, improve decision-making and empower employees to focus on purposeful work. Be assured, we understand the power of AI commands great responsibility. With that in mind, we are at the vanguard of this topic, and we'll be issuing our policy on the responsible use of AI in the third quarter. Shifting to our business segment results, our leading Group Benefits business reported adjusted earnings of $533 million, representing an all-time quarterly record, as Group Life mortality experience snapped back from the seasonally impacted first quarter. Group Life mortality registered a benefit ratio of 79.1% in the second quarter. For the year-to-date period, the Group Life benefit ratio is now firmly at the lower end of our annual target range of 84% to 89%. Our growth strategy in the attractive Group Benefits space is twofold. On a national accounts basis, employers with greater than 5,000 employees, we are driving penetration across employer groups via new products and greater employee participation. On a regional accounts basis, employers with less than 5,000 employees, we are seeking to accelerate growth via a more refined distribution focus, broader suite of products and by attacking white space, the absence of any employer-offered benefits. Across both avenues of growth, national and regional, increasing enrollment and utilization of voluntary products are primary elements of boosting sales and margins. Moving to RIS. Business momentum was evident in our Retirement and Income Solutions segment, which enjoyed several notable wins. These included two jumbo pension risk transfer deals totaling $3.5 billion, a $2.2 billion stable value addition, as well as $3.3 billion of U.K. longevity reinsurance, underscoring the breadth of our liability origination in this segment. Beyond these wins, we continue to see strong flow for structured to see strong flow for structured settlements where we are the market leader, with more than $700 million sold in the second quarter. In Asia, we enjoyed solid growth across a range of metrics. While sales in Japan have been impacted by currency fluctuations, assets under management in Asia continue to grow, rising 5% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. Outside of Japan, sales were up 60% on the strength of a large group sale in Australia. Looking to Latin America, top line and bottom-line results were strong, again, despite some currency headwinds. Adjusted premium fees and other revenues were up 12% on a constant currency basis, pointing to sustained business momentum in Mexico, Chile, and Brazil. EMEA adjusted earnings rose 10% year-over-year on strong volume growth and higher recurring interest margins. Adjusted PFOs were up 12% on a constant currency basis due to strong sales across the region. Our business in EMEA is an example of our efficiency mindset at work. We simplified the structure of our business and refocused it on protection products with strong free cash flow, producing positive, tangible results. Moving to capital and cash. MetLife is well-capitalized, and our capacity to generate strong recurring free cash flow allows us to meet our commitments and provide flexibility to proactively seize attractive growth opportunities. And in the absence of compelling M&A opportunities, we will return capital to our shareholders. We were active on the capital management front in the second quarter from both an equity and debt standpoint. We paid common stock dividends of roughly $400 million, reflecting a 4.8% increase to our common stock dividend per share. We also bought back around bought back around $900 million of our common shares in the second quarter and repurchased about another $270 million worth in July. This brings total common stock repurchase for the year through July to about $2.3 billion. We still have roughly $2.8 billion remaining on our Board authorization. From a debt standpoint, we paid off or redeemed approximately $1.5 billion of debt and issued $500 million of senior debt. We have now largely prefunded our 2025 maturing debt issues. And finally, at the end of the second quarter, we had $4.4 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. Turning to our recently published Sustainability Report. MetLife operates within a virtuous circle comprised of our customers, our people, our communities, and our shareholders with the objective of delivering long-term value to each of these stakeholders. Perhaps nowhere is the success of these efforts more evident than in the pages of our Annual Sustainability Report and can be found on MetLife's website. In it, you'll see highlights of our efforts to build more confident futures for our stakeholders and updates on our sustainability commitments. Among our many successes, I am pleased to mention that the MetLife Foundation has surpassed $1 billion in total giving in its history. As a 156-year-old company, and the intent to log another 156 years more, sustainability is an essential part of MetLife's heritage. As I close, one of the objectives of our Next Horizon strategy was to emerge as a stronger, more predictable company. As we approach the finish line of that five-year strategic cycle, we are on track to accomplish, if not exceed, each of the key targets and objectives we laid out relative to distributable cash, operating leverage and return on equity. As I have said before, we do not stand still here at MetLife. We constantly look for opportunities to raise the bar and challenge ourselves further, pursuing these new challenges with passion and enthusiasm. We are hard at work developing and pressure testing our next five-year strategy, which we are calling New Frontier. This will build on the core pillars of Next Horizon while looking to accelerate growth, boost returns, and foster consistency. The first stop on this journey will begin with our annual board strategy review in September. Subsequently, I look forward to sharing with you our plans for the future at our Investor Day scheduled for December 12th of this year. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our quarterly performance in more detail.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll start with the 2Q 2024 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital position. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. We had net derivative losses, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar versus the yen, as well as higher interest rates. That said, derivative losses were partially offset by market risk benefit, or MRB, remeasurement gains due to the higher interest rates and stronger equity markets. Net investment losses were mainly the result of normal trading activity for fixed maturity securities in a higher rate environment. Overall, the investment portfolio remains well positioned, credit losses continue to be modest, and our hedging program performed as expected. On page 4, you can see the second quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which should not have any notable items in either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion, up 9% and 11% on a constant currency basis. Favorable underwriting, volume growth and higher variable investment income drove the year-over-year increase. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.28, up 18% and up 20% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, group benefits adjusted earnings were $533 million, up 43% year-over-year, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins. The group life mortality ratio was a record low of 79.1%, well below our annual target range of 84% to 89%, driven by favorable experience across all coverages. The strong group life results mirrored the notably low number of US deaths between the ages of 25 and 64 in April and May, according to CDC data. Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 70.8% in the quarter, toward the bottom end of our annual target range of 69% to 74%, and below the prior year quarter of 73.7%. Favorable disability results benefited from a reserve adjustment of approximately $30 million after tax. Turning to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 200 basis points, the underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year, and at the midpoint of our 2024 target growth range of 4% to 6%. Group benefits 2Q 2024 year-to-date sales were up 11%, driven by strong growth across most products, including our suite of voluntary products. RIS adjusted earnings were $410 million, down 2% versus the prior year. Lower recurring interest margins were partially offset by higher variable investment income and strong volume growth. RIS investment spreads were 121 basis points, down 6 basis points sequentially, mainly due to the expiration of interest rate caps in the second quarter of 2024. We anticipate that spreads will remain between our annual target range of 115 and 140 basis points in the third quarter. Although we foresee an increase in variable investment income, it will likely be balanced out by reduced earnings from the expiration of the interest rate caps. RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were up 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of institutional income annuities as well as growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we had approximately $3.5 billion in deals in the second quarter and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $449 million, up 4% and 8% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins and higher variable investment income. For Asia's key growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis compared to a strong prior year quarter. While Japan sales were down 19% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the impact of yen volatility on foreign currency products. This was more than offset by strong sales growth of 60% in the rest of the region, including a large group case in Australia Latin America adjusted earnings were $226 million, up 3% on reported basis and 8% on a reported basis, primarily driven by solid volume growth across the region and favorable underwriting. This was partially offset by lower Chilean encaje returns of a negative 2.4% in Q2 of 2024 compared to a positive 1.4% in Q2 of the prior year. Latin America's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 9% or 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $77million, up 10% and 20% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth and higher recurring interest margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 7% and 12% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 31% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth in Turkey, the Gulf and the U.K. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $153 million, down 27% versus the prior year quarter. The primary driver was the foregone earnings due to the reinsurance transaction that closed in November. Corporate and Other adjusted loss was $220 million versus an adjusted loss of $228 million in the prior year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 24% and within our 2024 guidance range of 24% to 26%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters, including $298 million in Q2 of 2024. Private equity portfolio, which makes up the vast majority of the VII asset balance, had a positive 2.3% return in the quarter, while our real estate equity funds had a negative 1.4% return in the quarter. As a reminder, both private equity and real estate equity funds are reported on a one-quarter lag. Looking ahead, we expect VII returns to continue to improve over the course of second half of the year. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the last four quarters and the second quarter of 2024. As you can see in the chart, Asia, RIS and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile. Now turning to Page 7. The chart on the left of page illustrates the left of page illustrates the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the last three years, including second quarters of 2023 and 2024. Adjusted net investment income in Q2 of 2024 was up $120 million year-over-year. Recurring investment income has benefited from higher interest rates, partially offset by the roll-off from higher interest rates caps. In addition, we have seen VII improvement driven by higher private equity returns. Turning your attention to the right side of the page. This shows our new money yield versus roll-off shows our new money yield versus roll-off yields since second quarter of 2021. Over the last nine quarters, new money yields have outpaced roll-off yields, consistent with higher interest rates. In the second quarter of 2024, our global new money rate achieved the yield of 6.27%, 63 basis points higher than the roll-off rate. We anticipate that the new money yields will remain above roll-off yields given the prevailing interest rate environment. However, the spread can fluctuate depending on the mix of sales across our businesses. Now moving to expenses discussed on Page 8, this chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for full year 2023 of 12.2% and the first two quarters of 2024, both at 11.9%. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q2 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. Looking ahead, we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in the second half of the year, consistent with the seasonal nature of our business. That said, our performance year-to-date positions us well to achieve a full year 2024 direct expense ratio of 12.3% or below demonstrating our consistent execution and a sustained efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $4.4 billion at June 30th, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion, but down from $5.2 billion at March 31st. The sequential decline in holding companies' cash is primarily a result of approximately $1.5 billion used in April for a debt maturity and a debt redemption, partially offset by a $500 million senior debt issuance in June. Beyond this, cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, and share repurchases of roughly $900 million in the second quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $270 million in July. For our US companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2024 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.9 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while net income was approximately $1.3 billion. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18 billion as of June 30, down 2% from March 31, 2024, primarily due to dividends paid and derivative losses partially offset by operating earnings. Finally, we expect that Japan's solvency margin ratio to be approximately 670% as of June 30, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Before I wrap up, I would just like to highlight that we have an updated commercial mortgage loan slide as of June 30 in the appendix. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform as expected with attractive loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios as well as the expectation of modest losses. In summary, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals was evident with strong top line growth, disciplined underwriting and prudent expense management. Our Group Benefits segment achieved record earnings. Higher interest rates continue to support flows and spreads. And we continue to see improvement in variable investment income. MetLife continues to move forward from a position of strength with a strong balance sheet and a diversified set of market-leading businesses, generating solid recurring free cash flow. And we are committed to deploying this free cash flow to achieve responsible growth and build long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to our first question from Tom Gallagher at Evercore.
Tom Gallagher: Good morning. Wanted to ask a couple on the Group Benefits business. First is, can you just unpack the non-medical health results? How were -- how was the underlying disability versus dental? And where -- also, can you just comment on pricing, maybe on both of those products and how you think about renewals? Thanks.
Ramy Tadros: Sure, Tom. Good morning. It's Ramy Tadros here. So, I think just from a headline ratio perspective, just to reference John's remarks, the overall ratio of 70.8, you want to just normalize that for one-off nonrecurring reserve adjustment. So that gets you back into kind of the 72.2 range. So, on your question on dental and disability. So in the second quarter for dental, we did see utilization rates come down from the first quarter. And what you're seeing here is just normal seasonality in that business and where Q1 tends to be heavier in terms of utilization as these benefits reset typically at the beginning of the year. And in terms of how we think about dental and dental pricing going forward, if you step back from the current quarter -- as you know, dental is an inflationary product, and we do deploy a number of levers to ensure we manage and stay within our target margins. And the two, I would highlight here is that the majority of our claims come within our network, which gives us a greater line of sight and control over margin. And the other key lever here is renewal pricing. And this is a business where we remain disciplined in terms of our rate guarantee periods. And in aggregate, we can reprice about 80% of our book every year. And that's exactly what we've been doing. So we've been seeing overall trends in the last kind of, call it, year and a half pick up, and we've seen pressure on margins because of that. And we've been taking appropriate action -- pricing action across the entire block in response to that trend. At this stage, most of these actions are behind us. We've implemented them across the book. And going forward, we'll continue to kind of monitor the trend and take actions as necessary. But just think of that as more business as usual of how you manage an inflationary product like dental. On disability, I would say the underlying block is running very much in line with expectations. We see some slight increases in incidents, but severity has come down and we continue to still see very strong recoveries. And so, the core business continues to be healthy and very much in line. And I would say just on renewals, in aggregate, we're hitting our target renewal pricing across the book. And we're still maintaining very strong persistency here. So we feel pretty good about both the new business, both about the renewal pricing, coupled with persistency and you clearly need to watch both in this business.
Tom Gallagher: Great. Thanks for that, Ramy. And just my quick follow-up. How are you feeling about the level of competition in the market? We've heard about new entrants putting some pressure on sales and pricing. Are you guys seeing that? Or are you -- is not affecting you in terms of margin and pricing?
Ramy Tadros: I mean the short answer is that it's not affecting us. I would overall characterize the market as competitive, largely rational. You occasionally see aggressive pricing, but that is more of a -- of an outlier than the norm here, Tom. I mean our perspective here is also informed by ongoing rigorous surveillance. We look at every single metric in the market on an ongoing basis. And I would say we have not seen any evidence of a change in the competitive environment. The key point here for us is, as we've always talked about before, we have positioned this business to compete on a range of factors, inclusive of price. So while price is important, the basis of how we compete extends to multiple factors beyond price. This is ultimately a scale business, capabilities matter, experience matter, product breadth matters. And the ability to invest, which comes with scale, also really matters. So some of the new entrants that you've referenced are pretty small in terms of their overall premium size, they largely operate at the very small end of the market with narrower capabilities. And we haven't seen any meaningful impact or say, any impact on our book from those new competitors.
Tom Gallagher: Great. Thanks.
Operator: We'll move next to Suneet Kamath at Jefferies.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just to follow-up on Group Benefits. The earnings power of this business has improved pretty substantially. I mean, normally think about this as maybe a $400 million business and excluding the reserve release, you're over $500 million. Is that sort of a sustainable level of earnings power for this business? Or is there anything that we should be thinking about that maybe broke the right way in the quarter?
Ramy Tadros: Yeah. Good morning. It's Ramy here. Again, I think the one item I would point to here is the Group Life ratio. This is a historical low for us. It's mainly driven by lower volume. And the lower volume, if you step back and look at the CDC data, in terms of the old course [ph] death in the US population, that has come down significantly in the second quarter as well. So I would say that's the one here that was tailwind in the quarter, which we're pleased with. But if you think about our expectations on a go-forward basis, we think mortality will kind of moderate back in line with historical levels. You still see the seasonality that you in this business. And so a better view of that on a run rate basis, I'll bring you back to our guidance range. And if you look at that on a year-to-date basis, we're about 84.7. So I think that's the one that you want to kind of look out for in terms of the, I would say, the one item this quarter, which was material, which gave us a bit of a tailwind here.
Suneet Kamath: Got it. That makes sense. And then I guess on RIS, in terms of the spreads, I mean, think last quarter, you guided to maybe 8 bps to 10 bps of sequential compression. I think you came in much better than that. So just curious what you'd attribute that to? And then how should we be thinking about the progress of that spread as we kind of transition to 3Q and then ultimately 4Q?
John McCallion: Yes. Thanks, Suneet. It's John. Good morning. So as you mentioned, so in the quarter, we came in at 121 basis points, that was within the 115 to 140 guidance. And then if you exclude VII, it was 119. And so a couple of things, right? We saw continued improvement in VII in the quarter. As you mentioned, we expected a decline from first quarter as a result of lower recurring interest margins due to the roll off of the interest rate caps. And we did anticipate it to be 8 to 10. It came in less, and it's primarily due higher-than-expected interest rates which we took advantage of during the course of the quarter. And so it was a little better than we thought. Having said that, I think our guidance that we gave last quarter is we continued to believe another 8 to 10 would occur during the course of the Q3 on ex-VII as most of the of the remaining interest rate caps mature over the course next few months. And then we should see spreads stabilize in most of the in-the-money interest rate caps purchased primarily during kind of pre- and even in the COVID era matures by then. So that's kind of how I would kind of play out the rest of this year. And I think if you go back to what we said at the outlook call, which was, we thought, all in, 2024 would show an all-in spread similar to 2023. And that's generally where we're trending towards.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks, John.
Operator: Next, we'll move to Ryan Krueger at KBW.
Ryan Krueger: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess on Japan, could you give some perspective on the sales environment there? I think you had -- it was a tougher year ago comparison, but you had some declines in sales. So just hoping to get a little more color on the different product areas there.
Lyndon Oliver: Hey, Ryan, it's Lyndon here. So let me give you some color on sales across Asia, including what we're seeing in Japan. So sales for the quarter grew 5%, including our divested operations in Malaysia. We also saw a 5% growth in assets under management. While Japan single premium FX sales were impacted by the yen weakness, we did see an offset when we look at across the rest of Asia. Japan sales were lower in the single premium US dollar products. But as you said, we're up against a tough comparative. In the second quarter, the weaker yen did impact the overall market for the foreign currency products. And so if we look at the overall banca market, this market has shrunk, but we continue to maintain our share in this space. Look, we have a diversified portfolio, and we are rebalancing between product mix between yen and US dollars. So if you look at the outlook for yen products, it has improved with higher interest rates and also with the positive macro environment that we're seeing in Japan. Now we have introduced a couple of new products, both the variable life as well as cancer product earlier this year. And they both have performed very well. We've got other product launches planned in the pipeline, some coming in later this year, as well as at the beginning of next year. So we've got strong growth in the rest of Asia, and that's also contributing to the overall story. We saw solid performance in Korea, in China, in India, and also strong year-over-year growth in all these countries. And then in the quarter, in Japan, we benefited from a large group case which came on risk in the second quarter. If we look at the outlook, first half actual sales were in line with the prior year, and we expect a similar trend as we go through the second half. So given this, we expect full year sales for Asia to be flat year-over-year. I hope that helps.
John McCallion: Yes. And I would just -- it's a large group case in Australia. I think you mentioned Japan, but...
Michel Khalaf: Sorry, yes, in Australia.
Ryan Krueger: Thanks. One quick follow-up. I think I think you -- I think there's been some elevated surrender activity in Japan. Just -- any more info on that? And to what extent has that impacted earnings in recent quarters?
John McCallion: Yes. Now we did see some benefit in earnings. We saw a 4% increase in adjusted earnings on a reported as well as an 8% increase on a constant currency basis. This was driven both by favorable underwriting given by the surrenders, as well as variable investment income. When you look at surrender activities, it was higher than expected in the quarter, given we had the weaker yen as some customers choose to lock in some of the gains. And if we look at the VII in the quarter, Asia does get a higher allocation of real estate equity funds in the -- and so in the quarter, we did see better performance in the real estate relative to the prior year. We've also had good expense management in the quarter, and that's contributed to the stronger earnings. If you look at the outlook for the year, we expect full year earnings to kind of remain strong, in line with guidance. VII performance will continue to be a factor that will impact our earnings going forward.
Ryan Krueger: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Wes Carmichael at Autonomous Research.
Wes Carmichael: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just focusing on Japan for a second, but with the SMR ratio around 670% in the quarter, could you maybe just give us an update regarding the transition to ESR in Japan, if there's been any material changes in how you're feeling about implementation at this point?
John McCallion: Wes, it's John. Good morning. So as you mentioned, 670% is our estimate for the quarter. We'll file that in a few weeks. I'd just like to start out by saying no concerns around capital generation or dividends, right? And that ratio tends to have some asymmetrical impacts when rates rise. But as we know, the overall economic value of businesses improved. So the other thing we saw in this quarter is it's generally a heavier cash out quarter for us. We have higher dividends. We pay taxes. So there's a little bit of timing there. And then as you mentioned, the new ESR comes into effect April 1, 2025. We'll report on that for the first time, March 31, 2026. And that is more of an economic framework, one of which that we have typically managed this business. We've used economic as well as stat as we think about like product pricing and development and things like that. So that's kind of a good place to start from. In addition, I'd say implementation is going well. We don't see any big issues. There are some -- a few items that we're just continuing to work through with the regulator. But even if those don't come to fruition, we can certainly manage, but we're hopeful to make some improvements to the kind of the current situation. All in, we're comfortable. And I'd say -- I'd say, supportive of moving from the SMR to the ESR.
Wes Carmichael: Thanks, John. And just maybe switching to the commercial mortgage loan portfolio. I think the loan-to-value ratio has deteriorated a little bit, at least in office quarter-over-quarter. But could you give us an update on your watch list? Any loans that are in the foreclosure process and if there's any properties where you might be expecting to take them on balance sheet?
John McCallion: Okay. Great. Thanks, Wes. A lot in there to unpack, but let me just maybe start with the LTV. So you mentioned -- and we kind of forecasted this in the first quarter. We thought year prior, we had kind of given some peak to trough views. We thought it had another 10% broadly to go in some of the more distressed areas. And as you know, when we go through our annual appraisal process, it happens throughout the year, we typically wait for the second quarter. We find it hard to do it in the first quarter because we'd like to get financial information in our hands before we start that. So 2Q tends to be a heavy revaluation quarter. And so that's kind of what we saw happen generally in line with expectations. Overall, LTV ticked up one point overall. A couple of points more in office. And then as we look out for the rest of this year, probably heavier ones were done in the second quarter. We'll still see some, I'd say, modest deterioration, maybe another point overall in the second half and a little more maybe a couple of points in office. Look, I think it's playing out as expected. Last year, we had write-offs of roughly 20. We think this year, you're in kind of closer to maybe 100, but maybe below. So still modest. We had a little under $30 million year-to-date so far, and we think we're on track for kind of that kind of closer to $100 million of write-offs for the year, very well within kind of the modest area for us in terms of our capital and size and position. So again, we think the environment is -- despite the pressure, economic growth remains healthy and that's actually good news for real estate fundamentals. Despite office sector still probably has some kind of some work to do there, but you also have moderating construction pipeline, which is benefiting all properties. And so this is how this sector generally works out. It takes time. It doesn't happen overnight. You need to be well positioned going into it to be able to kind of manage through the kind of the pressure and the distress. And generally, the demand and supply factors typically work themselves out. So all in all, I think things are performing as expected for us, and no change to our view.
Wes Carmichael: Thanks, John.
Operator: We'll move next to Jimmy Bhullar at JPMorgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hey. Good morning. My questions are mostly answered, but I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of points. First, on Japan, the decline in sales that you saw, how much of that is just a function of comps and maybe the volatility in the yen depressing sales of ForEx products versus an uptick in competition or price reductions by competitors or other market dynamics that are causing you to actively pull back?
Lyndon Oliver: Hey Jimmy, it's Lyndon here. So yeah, look, we did have a tough comparative last year. I think sales in Japan were up over 40% when we look at last year. So that is driving a lot of the results this year, but we are also seeing a weaker yen, and this has impacted the overall market for foreign currency products. The bank market, as I said, has declined, but we continue to maintain our market position over there. So I do think the volatility in the end is driving some of the decline we're seeing in sales.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on RIS spreads, I think you've been clear that there's interest rate caps that are expiring later this year or in the third quarter. But should we assume that they'll stabilize in 4Q on a core basis ex-VII? And then are there other puts and takes as you're thinking about spreads going into next year, whether it's caps or sort of maturity of blocks or anything else or business coming out of end of period that would drive a shift in spread margins one way or the other?
John McCallion: Hey Jimmy. It's John. Good morning. Yeah, as was alluded to in kind of the opening remarks and earlier is that we do have another quarter of 8 to 10 bps is what we forecasted. Like I said earlier, we thought we were going to have 8 to 10 this quarter, but interest rates were a bit higher than we had assumed at the time we were discussing this in the Q1, and we took advantage of that and a few different things we could do. So then the remainder -- most of the remaining interest rate cash roll off this quarter, and then you should see stabilization. Also, we're projecting VII to marginally increase each of the next two quarters as well, kind of similar to the trend that we saw here. So, that would be kind of the offset comment I'd make to you. And then you should see some stabilization in the Q4. In terms of beyond that, we'll wait for outlook to go through that information.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on competition in Japan, is it still rational? Or are you seeing any evidence of price reductions with the higher interest rates in that market?
Lyndon Oliver: Look, I mean it is a competitive environment. But I would say it's rational. We always see a player get more aggressive once in a while, but we continue to maintain our pricing discipline and our focus on profitability. We've got a very diversified distribution platform. We've got a wide range of product set to both yen as well as U.S. dollar. We've got good investment origination capabilities along with strong internal reinsurance capabilities. All this combined kind of puts us in a good position, allows us to differentiate and maintain our competitive position in the market.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks and good morning. My first question, maybe starting on the PRT side, can you just give some color just on what you see in the pipeline for back half of this year and just any change in the competitive market for that business?
Ramy Tadros: Good morning, Elyse. It's Ramy here. With respect to the pipeline, we're still seeing a pretty healthy pipeline here, particularly on the larger end of the market, which is where we focus and where we have [Technical Difficulty] advantages. And if you step beyond the next couple of quarters, there are just secular trends here that bode really well for us and how we're positioned. If you survey corporate DB plan sponsors and survey after survey, including ours, they all point to a significant and rising proportion of those plan sponsors who are looking to derisk and transfer the risk. You also have a very large stock of corporate DB assets, $3 trillion if you look at the private market only. And you've got funding status that's pretty good, which makes all of these risk transfers a lot more affordable. So these will always be lumpy, but sitting here now, looking at the rest of the year, we're seeing a pretty healthy jumbo pipeline. And we're also very pleased with what we've done this quarter. As you saw, we did $3.5 billion of PRT. And we're clearly very pleased with our performance here.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you. And maybe the second question on Asia, the earnings were pretty strong in the quarter. I think you guys called out favorable underwriting maybe in the prepared remarks. Anything just more to think about just kind of the run rate earnings within that segment and anything that stood out in the quarter?
Lyndon Oliver: Yeah, hi Elyse, its Lyndon here. As I said earlier, I mean, we're pleased with the overall results in Asia or earnings in the quarter. We did see higher-than-expected surrender activity, and that was driven by the weaker yen as some customers start to lock in their gains. And that was higher than expected in the quarter. In addition, we did see Asia does get a higher allocation of real estate equity funds. And in the quarter, we saw better performance in real estate relative to the prior year, so those two are sort of drivers for the strong earnings results in the quarter for Asia.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Barnidge at Piper Sandler.
John Barnidge: Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. With the capital regime change in Japan, is there an opportunity to broaden out the Bermuda platform, create more capital-light model? Thank you.
John McCallion: Hey John, it's John. Good morning. I'll take that one. So look, I think that's something we've always had in place for quite some time. We actually have two Bermuda entities right now. And we've had them for close to a decade in place. So it's a tool we have used and probably one that we have used successfully with some of our Japan products. I think ESR will allow you to reevaluate some of that and determine what's fit for purpose. And it's really -- we look at -- one of the factors we always consider as we kind of take our own internal economic model and think about what's a prudent level of capital and then we evaluate that relative to some of the jurisdiction requirements. So -- but certainly, Bermuda has been and continues to be an optimization tool for us. And I think we'll continue to do that, not just -- and by the way, not just with Japan, sometimes we use it with other jurisdictions as well.
John Barnidge: Thanks for the answer, John. And my follow-up question is on the opportunity to leverage the large data that you have. Can you talk about the opportunity set? Is it about driving greater profitability or revenues or close rates of persistency? Thanks.
Michel Khalaf: Hi, John, it's Michel. Thanks for the question. So as I mentioned in my remarks, we've been investing in technology and capabilities and -- that's part of our sort the efficiency mindset that we've built here, freeing up capacity to make those important investments. And the fact that we have size here, we have a lot of data, obviously, is an advantage because we're able to leverage this data. And I would say there are three areas where we've seen, in some cases, early signs, in other cases, more advanced signs of real impact on progress. One is around the customer experience. And again, if you think about that, very important in terms of meeting not only current but future customer expectations, driving our competitive advantage. I think the other area where we're seeing a potential impact is around driving revenue growth. So technology and data can help drive that. And the third area is around efficiency. And again, here, we see significant opportunities. You can see from our direct expense ratio, which has come in at below the 12.3 [ph] guidance that we provided in the first half. And our expectation is that whereas we'll see sort of a tick up in the second half, which is typical, we will still expect to come in under the 12.3. And I would say, going forward, those investments that we're making and our ability to leverage data will continue to drive sort of a downward trend when it comes to that as well.
John Barnidge: Thank you for that.
Operator: And we'll move next to Mike Ward at Citi.
Mike Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I was hoping to ask about holdings to your scheme. I'm curious how active those discussions are? Any kind of pressure or change in activity to execute before Fed cuts? Or is it agnostic to that, but any update?
John McCallion: Hey, Mike, good morning. It's John. Thanks for the question. I think I can't remember the last time we spoke about this, but I'd say that obviously, we did the transaction back in November of last year. And think the environment has continued to progress is way I think we would put it. We are still in the same position today, which is that we don't -- we are continuing to meet with third parties. We continue to explore opportunities. This needs to be kind of a win-win, but there's no burning platform where we have to do something. So it's a real -- it's an opportunity. It's not a requirement for us to or a necessity for us. And so -- but that requires continuous discussions, evaluations, reviews We did a large nontraditional life transaction last year. We generally have traditional life blocks left. We have obviously LTC, and then we have VA. And obviously, the traditional life is very attractive to people, but it's also attractive to us in terms of returns. So I think that would be a price one. And then the other ones, there's limited supply of partners that would be willing to kind of think about that. So you're talking about a more narrow universe. So you continue to discuss those things, and we're happy to manage it ourselves. But if we're able to find unique opportunities, then we'll do that. But I would say it's gotten -- discussions continue, but no material changes in terms of momentum.
Mike Ward: Helpful. Thanks, John. And then maybe on private credit. It seems to be an area of attention, maybe a bit frothy. Just curious how you guys see that landscape? Are you leaning in or being more cautious? And I guess like -- what's your strategy? How do you balance having the ability to originate directly versus investing in some of the boutique shops that you've done?
John McCallion: It's John again. It's an interesting question. I think, first, definitionally, private credit probably has 100 different definitions out there. So that's always a tough 1 to kind of decide which 1 you -- which everyone is talking about. But I think at the end of the day, we have been in private credit, broadly speaking, for 150 years, right? I mean you can -- if you cast a wide net there, whether it's our commercial mortgage loan origination, we have an ag loan platform, we're the largest ag lender outside of the US government. We're -- I think we're the number one infrastructure lender as well. And so -- but we typically were higher grade, and we have some higher-yielding products as well and so we have a number of origination platforms. It's something we've talked about over the years is a unique capability for us. And so -- but to your point, it's an area that everyone has been jumping in. So now you need to be much -- very disciplined in your approach. There is kind of a -- kind of view around the term private credit. And so we have approached it our way, which is for the long-term is the way we think about it. And -- so I think that's used to our approach and everyone has their own unique approach to it, but we're -- there are sectors that much more competitive today that I think we would say you need to be mindful of.
Mike Ward: Thanks, John.
Operator: And that concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to John Hall for closing remarks.
John Hall: Great. Thank you, operator, and thanks, everybody for joining for joining us this morning. Have a great summer.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings.
 With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. 
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on MetLife's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. In addition to our earnings release, we issued a press release last night announcing a $3 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization.
 Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review.
 On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussions are other members of senior management.
 As usual, last night, we released our standard set of supplemental slides, which are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to the slides features disclosures GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should similarly review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session.
 Given the busy morning, Q&A will end promptly just before the top of the hour. In fairness to everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel. 
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from last night's report, MetLife is getting off to a good start for the year. We delivered another solid quarter of financial results, reflecting strong top line growth, consistent execution and sustained momentum across our market-leading portfolio of businesses. We achieved this mindful that change and uncertainty remain constant in the current environment.
 Our resilience and consistency are made possible by the unwavering commitment of our associates, our unabated confidence in our all-weather Next Horizon strategy and our unyielding focus on controlling those factors we can control to drive value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.
 With change as a persistent backdrop, MetLife's 156-year track record of risk management is stable stakes for our customers and shareholders. As I addressed in my shareholder letter, central to this notion is protecting our balance sheet so we can meet the promises we've made to our policyholders and shareholders regardless of economic or geopolitical conditions.
 Risk management extends across virtually everything we do, the way we invest and manage our capital and liquidity to the way we price, underwrite and reserve for the products we sell. Another element of risk management at MetLife lies in our diversification. We operate across a range of products and geographies, many that have offsetting risk characteristics such as mortality versus longevity among others.
 Even within our business segments, we have diversification. Our Group Benefits business serves employers across a wide range of business sizes and industries and has customers in every state. A similar theme runs through Retirement and Income Solutions and can be seen in the multiple liability streams we are able to originate, capital markets, pension risk transfers, structured settlements, stable value, corporate-owned life insurance and longevity reinsurance, among others.
 Our diversification is at the core of who we are and further differentiates MetLife. It is not coincident, but by design. We have constructed a platform to deliver for the long term and believe our diversification promotes both sustainable and responsible growth.
 Turning to the quarter. We reported adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion or $1.83 per share, up 20% per share from the prior year period. This was aided by a partial rebound in variable investment income led by private equity gains, which delivered a positive return of 2.1%.
 In the aggregate, net income for the first quarter was $800 million, well above $14 million from the prior year period. Top line growth was strong across our market-leading set of businesses, with adjusted premium fees and other revenues, or PFOs, totaling $12 billion, up 4% compared to the first quarter of 2023. On a constant currency basis, PFOs were up 5%.
 Our unrelenting focus on execution continues to drive positive results across important key metrics. MetLife posted a 13.8% adjusted return on equity in the quarter, still within the 13% to 15% target range despite VII not yet hitting a more normal quarterly run rate. Our direct expense ratio of 11.9% improved from a year ago and was lower than our 12.3% annual target. The positive leverage captured by this ratio illustrates our ability to control costs as well as grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses.
 Shifting to MetLife's business performance in the quarter, Group Benefits generated $6.3 billion of adjusted PFOs, up 5% or up 6% adjusting for participating policies from the prior year period, driven by solid growth across most products, including further expansion and voluntary benefits.
 Our premier national accounts franchise continues to demonstrate its differentiation and deliver value to customers through its comprehensive range of products and a customer experience enhanced by innovative technology platforms. In the quarter, Group Benefits' adjusted earnings of $284 million was impacted by seasonally high life mortality and seasonally elevated nonmedical health utilization returning to a historical trend more recently masked by the pandemic.
 Showing the continued vitality of this flagship business, sales were up 25% from the prior year, propelled by our sustained efforts to drive enrollment, which pushed growth across core and voluntary products. Last month, MetLife launched our 2024 employee benefit front study in its 22nd year, the survey tracks evolving employer and employee dynamics and the impact that macro environment and other trends have on the workplace and the employee benefits ecosystem.
 Through the years, we've enjoyed tremendous engagement with our customers as a result of the survey demonstrated thought leadership and this year's survey with its focus on employee care was no different. The business case for employee care is clear.
 Our research and other studies showed that one organizations offer a range of benefits, employees are more holistically healthy and business performance is stronger. As the largest group benefits provider, this ties directly into our strategy to offer the widest array of products, which gives MetLife more opportunities to serve our customers and more avenues to drive growth.
 Our leading Retirement and Income Solutions business reported adjusted earnings of $399 million, essentially flat with last year. Higher interest rates continue to increase the attractiveness of many of the products we offer within RIS.
 Overall, quarterly sales in RIS were $2.7 billion, up 49% from the prior year, led by structured settlements and corporate-owned life insurance production.
 Our business in Asia posted a 51% increase in adjusted earnings on better variable investment income and favorable underwriting, particularly in Japan.
 Sales while robust were down relative to a strong quarter a year ago. Yet illustrating the strength of recent quarters, assets under management in Asia are up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis.
 In Latin America, our momentum continues across the region, particularly in our 2 largest markets of Mexico and Chile. The segment generated another record quarter of adjusted earnings with $233 million, rising 8% and 5% on a constant currency basis.
 Moving to capital and cash. Our operative philosophy on capital deployment relies on a balance across investing in organic and inorganic growth and returning capital to shareholders via common dividends and share repurchase.
 During the first quarter, MetLife linked into capital management. We paid $377 million to shareholders via common stock dividends, and we repurchased almost $1.2 billion of our common stock. After the quarter, we have repurchased about another $300 million of common stock in April. Also in April, we boosted our common dividend per share by 4.8%.
 Year-to-date through April, we have repurchased about $1.5 billion of our common shares. Along with reporting our first quarter results, you saw that we also announced the addition of $3 billion to our repurchase authorization. Our total share repurchase authorization now stands at approximately $3.6 billion, which allows us to proceed with repurchase at a more measured pace for the balance of the year.
 Shifting to governance, we announced during the quarter that Laura Hay joined our Board of Directors effective in February. Most recently, she was the Global Head of KPMG's insurance practice. We are excited to have Laura bring her broad set of actuarial and financial skills and her business experience to our board.
 In closing, as we near the conclusion of our 5-year Next Horizon framework, we are engaged in a thoughtful process to chart the next course of our strategic journey, building on a strong well-established foundation. I don't anticipate an abrupt departure from what has successfully delivered on our purpose always with you building a more confident future, but rather a further evolution.
 As we sought to raise the bar during Next Horizon, asking more of ourselves and delivering more than our stated goals, we've already started advancing towards the next phase of our strategy. The core principles of Next Horizon anchor our future actions, and we remain embedded in our strategic thinking as we move ahead.
 We are building on our strong foundation with a growth mindset and a range of opportunities that would not have been possible just a few years ago. We are well positioned to further differentiate ourselves and deliver additional value to customers fueling higher levels of growth. We have a tremendous opportunity to leverage our scale and harness emerging technologies to drive margin expansion, all the while achieving greater overall operating consistency.
 Taken together, we believe these powerful factors will result in greater returns for our shareholders. To that end, I look forward to discussing our refreshed strategy at an Investor Day here in New York on December 12 of this year.
 Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our first quarter performance in greater detail. 
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 1Q '24 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital position.
 Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. We had net derivative losses, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the yen and Chilean peso as well as favorable equity markets and higher interest rates.
 That said, derivative losses were mostly offset by market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement gains due to the higher interest rates and stronger equity markets. Net investment losses were mainly the result of normal trading activity for fixed maturity securities in a rising rate environment. Overall, the investment portfolio remains well positioned. Credit losses continued to be modest and our hedging program performed as expected.
 On Page 4, you can see the first quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which do not have any notable items in either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, up 13% on a reported and constant currency basis. Higher variable investment income due to a rebound in private equity returns drove the year-over-year increase. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.83, up 20% and up 21% on a constant currency basis.
 Moving to the businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $284 million, down 7% year-over-year, primarily due to less favorable underwriting margins. The Group Life mortality ratio was 90.2%, a slight improvement versus Q1 of '23 of 90.5% and above the top end of our annual target range of 84% to 89% as Group Life's Mortality ratio tends to be seasonally highest in the first quarter.
 Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 73.9% in the quarter, at the top end of its annual target range of 69% to 74%, in line with our expectation of higher seasonal dental utilization in the first quarter.
 Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 5% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 100 basis points, the underlying PFOs were up approximately 6% year-over-year and at the top end of our 2024 target growth range of 4% to 6%.
 In addition, Group Benefits sales were up 25%, driven by strong growth across core and voluntary products.
 RIS adjusted earnings were $399 million, essentially flat versus Q1 of '23. Higher variable investment income was offset by lower recurring interest margins as well as less favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads were 127 basis points at the midpoint of our annual target range of 115 to 140 basis points. This incorporates both the impact of the roll-off of our interest rate caps and the offsetting benefit of VII reemerging.
 RIS adjusted PFOs were up 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products as well as growth in U.K. longevity reinsurance. With regards to pension risk transfers, while we did not complete any transactions in the first quarter, we continue to see an active market.
 Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $423 million, up 51% and 57% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income, favorable underwriting margins and favorable tax benefits in Q1 of '24. For Asia's key growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Sales were down 8% on a constant currency basis versus a strong prior year quarter.
 Latin America adjusted earnings were $233 million, up 8% and 5% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. In addition solid Chilean encaje returns of 4.8% in Q1 of '24 compared to a negative 0.9% in Q1 of the prior year.
 Latin America's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 9% and 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region.
 EMEA adjusted earnings were $77 million, up 28% and 35% on a constant currency basis, driven by favorable underwriting, volume growth and higher recurring interest margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. While EMEA adjusted earnings were above trend this quarter, we still view the run rate to be $60 million to $65 million per quarter for the remainder of the year.
 EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 7% and 9% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 16% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth in Turkey and the U.K.
 MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $159 million versus $158 million in the prior year quarter. Higher private equity returns were offset by roughly $50 million in foregone earnings as a result of the reinsurance transaction that closed in November, in line with expectations.
 Adjusted earnings in the quarter were also pressured by a true-up associated with the reinsurance transaction.
 Corporate and other adjusted loss was $241 million versus an adjusted loss of $236 million in the prior year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 23%, below our 2024 guidance range of 24% to 26% due to several favorable tax items in the quarter.
 On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the prior 5 quarters, including $260 million in Q1 of '24. The private equity portfolio, which makes up the majority of the VII asset balance had a positive 2.1% return in the quarter, while real estate equity funds had a negative 5.8% return in Q1 of '24. Both are reported on a 1-quarter lag.
 In addition, as we've seen signs of improvement in PE secondary markets, we have opportunistically divested roughly $750 million of private equity general account assets in Q1 of '24 at a modest discount. The transaction structure will allow MetLife Investment Management to continue managing the assets from the sale. We believe this transaction, which is similar to the roughly $1 billion divestment that we made in 2022 is a thoughtful approach to managing our investment allocation while supporting an important and growing fee-generating business for MetLife.
 Looking ahead, we continue to expect VII returns to move toward the upper end of our near-term outlook range in the second half of the year, and we remain comfortable with our full year VII guidance of $1.5 billion.
 On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the fourth quarter of 2023 and Q1 of '24. As you can see in the chart, RIS, Asia and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile.
 Now turning to Page 7. The chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past 3 years and Q1 of '23 versus Q1 of '24. Adjusted net investment income in Q1 of '24 was up roughly $500 million or 10% year-over-year. While recurring investment income moderated in the quarter due to the roll off of the interest rate caps, we did see a solid recovery in PE returns driving the VII improvement year-over-year.
 Shifting your attention to the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yields since Q1 of '21. New money yields continue to outpace roll-off yields over the past 8 quarters, consistent with the rising rates. In the first quarter of 2024, our global new money rate achieved a yield of 6.6%, 103 basis points higher than the roll-off rate.
 Keep in mind, the roll-off rate can fluctuate from period to period, as it did in the first quarter due to a greater volume of higher-yielding floating rate assets paying off. We would expect this positive trend of new money yields outpacing roll-off yields to persist given the current level of interest rates.
 Now let's switch gears to discuss expenses on Page 8. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for the full year 2023 of 12.2% and Q1 of '24 of 11.9%. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results.
 Our Q1 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. We are off to a good start achieving a full year 2024 direct expense ratio of 12.3% or below, demonstrating our consistent execution and a sustained efficiency mindset.
 I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $5.2 billion at March 31, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. This includes approximately $1.4 billion used in April for a debt maturity and a debt redemption. We do not have any further debt maturities for the balance of the year.
 Beyond this, cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend and share repurchases of roughly $1.2 billion in the first quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $330 million in April.
 Regarding our statutory capital for our U.S. companies, our 2023 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 407% which is above our target ratio of 360%. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2024 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while net income was approximately $570 million.
 We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.3 billion as of March 31, 2024, down 6% from year-end 2023, primarily due to dividends paid and surplus notes repaid, partially offset by operating earnings.
 Finally, we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 725% as of March 31, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks.
 Before I wrap up, I would just highlight that we have an updated commercial mortgage loan slide as of March 31 in the appendix. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform as expected with attractive loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios as well as the expectation of modest losses.
 Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered another solid quarter to begin the new year. The underlying strength of our business fundamentals was evident with strong top line growth, coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management.
 In addition, our core spreads remain robust and sustainable given the higher yield environment. Also, we saw a nice rebound in our private equity returns. While the current environment remains uncertain, we are excited about the outlook and growth prospects of our businesses over the near term and beyond.
 MetLife continues to move forward from a position of strength with a strong balance sheet and a diversified set of market-leading businesses, which generate solid recurring free cash flow. And we are committed to deploying this free cash flow to achieve responsible growth and build long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.
 And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. 
Suneet Kamath: Just wanted to start with VII. John, you had mentioned, I think, a real estate loss of 5.8%. Can you just unpack that a little bit? Was that actually losses on sales or appraisals? And how do you see that tracking as we move through the balance of the year? 
John McCallion: Sure, Suneet. Primarily appraisals and valuation. So we actually saw, if you recall, in the fourth quarter, it was fairly flat. Appraisals, they tend to lag a bit in terms of just market declines. And so we saw kind of a catch-up of that in the fourth quarter, which obviously gets reported here in the first quarter.
 Our view is that it will start to moderate. We probably still have some pressure in 2Q, but less so and then moderates through the rest of this year. And then we think you start to see things start to pick up in a positive way towards the latter part of this year into '25. That's kind of the outlook. 
Suneet Kamath: Michel, on your comments for future share buybacks. I think you used the word measured pace. Is that measured pace relative to what you did in the first quarter? Or is that relative to what you did in April? And is the plan to exhaust the $3.6 billion authorization in 2024? 
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Suneet, thanks for the question. So yes, I did use the word measure, and I was referring to the first quarter. But I think as you've seen in the first quarter and what you've seen from us over time is that we do move expeditiously and deliberately to return capital to shareholders, especially in the absence of other high-value capital deployment opportunities following divestments.
 We did so following the spin-off of our former retail business following the sale of Auto and Home, and we closed on our risk transfer deal in the fourth quarter.
 So looking ahead and without me getting overly prescriptive, I would say that we lead into the first quarter at a pace that is greater than what you might see for the balance of the year. 
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. 
Ryan Krueger: First, I just wanted to clarify one thing on the variable investment income comment. John, did you say that you expected to be towards the higher end of the range that you had given for the balance of the year? 
John McCallion: Yes. Ryan, it's John. I think Suneet's question was focused on real estate. And so I think what we're just trying to -- and regarding outlook in terms of the real estate funds and so we saw a negative return this quarter of 5.8%. I mentioned I thought it would be less negative next quarter, but we still think there'll be a little pressure in just kind of the appraisals coming through and then it will start -- it will kind of moderate from there and start to have an upward trajectory is kind of the way we put it. 
Ryan Krueger: Okay. Got it. Other question was on the Group Benefits business. Can you talk more about the competitive environment you're seeing at this point as you went through January 1 renewals as well as what you saw with persistency and pricing? 
Ramy Tadros: Sure, Ryan. It's Ramy here. I would say, in terms of our view of the competitive dynamics of the group business, it really hasn't changed. I mean, we've always talked about this as a competitive marketplace. And one, because of the short-tail nature of this business is on the whole rationale. And we also think and see that this is a market where there are many avenues for differentiation beyond price.
 And look, if you have the scale to invest in the business, you can create true differentiation in this market and grow profitability -- and grow profitably. So the price, while important, becomes one out of multiple factors in the consideration set.
 So with that background, we're very pleased with our growth in sales this year. You saw a 25% increase in sales year-over-year. I should note that the strength of that momentum was across the board. So life, disability, dental as well as our voluntary suite of products. And from a pricing perspective, we're very pleased with the rate adequacy we got for that new business. And we're also very pleased with the rate increases that we got on renewals that were commensurate with our targets. So it's not a pretty solid picture, both in terms of the growth, persistency as well as the pricing and the rate increases. 
Operator: Next, we move on to Wes Carmichael with Autonomous Research. 
Wesley Carmichael: I had a question on pension risk transfer. I know you guys didn't have any deals in the quarter. But there were some deals that were done that were reasonable size and your peers has plenty of capital to support this marketplace right now. And there's actually another ongoing call right now that one of your peers are saying that PRT is not that good of a business this year, there's not as much spread. So I'm just wondering if pricing is getting more competitive there, if there's any dynamics changing in the marketplace. 
Ramy Tadros: Thank you. It's Ramy here again. Look, the -- we're coming off a very successful 2023 year in terms of PRT, we had 5 cases totaling more than $5 billion in premium, and that was off the back of a record year in '22, where we wrote more than $12 billion of premiums. This business is lumpy. So I would remind you, we did not win any deals in Q1 of '23 either, and we did not win any deals in Q1 of '24.
 But having said that, we continue to see a very robust pipeline ahead of us, particularly for the jumbo end of the market, where we focus. And this is not surprising. We've got very healthy funding levels of defined benefit plans and the desire for large plan sponsors to derisk. And we see this trend continuing for many, many years, and we're well positioned to win our fair share of the market here.
 From a pricing perspective, I would just emphasize what we've always said is that we look at these jumbo PRT deals with an M&A lens, and you kind of need to do that given the large quantum of capital that any given deal can consume. And we're very disciplined to ensure that we deploy that capital to its best and highest use.
 So we evaluate each transaction carefully. We will only deploy capital if the risk-adjusted returns are healthy and the ROEs are aligned with our enterprise targets. And as you look forward, we still see this as a large profit pool, a big opportunity and one where we're going to get our fair share. 
Wesley Carmichael: And Michel, I think you talked about higher rates increasing the attractiveness of your products. Just wanted to get a little perspective on capital deployment and how you're thinking about allocating capital towards growth in capital-intensive businesses where you can generate good IRRs versus buying back more stock, which continues to be pretty strong. 
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Sure, Wes. Thanks for the question. So our philosophy and approach is that we want to support organic growth. We've been doing so consistently. And you can see from our VNB disclosures the returns that we've been able to generate high teens and paybacks in the sort of mid-single digits.
 We like a good balance in terms of supporting organic -- deploying capital in support of organic growth. We continue to be in the flow looking at potential M&A transactions. We consider M&A to be a strategic capability here, but we're extremely disciplined when it comes to strategic set and sort of a consistent basis globally by which we look at M&A transactions.
 And then excess capital, as we've said, belongs to our shareholders. We want to continue to have an attractive dividend yield, and you can see that we increased our dividend by 4.8%. And then share repurchases, it's also sort of part of the equation. And so it's that balance that we like to maintain. And -- but we're certainly very keen on continuing to deploy capital in support of organic growth at attractive returns. 
Operator: And next, we move on to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. 
Jamminder Bhullar: So first on the question for John on your spreads in RIS. Healthy overall, but we saw a sequential decline in spreads, excluding variable investment income. And I think you attributed that to the expiration of some of the interest rate cap. So I'm wondering if you could give us some idea on the trajectory of that? And should we assume sort of a similar level of an impact from caps that are expiring in the next few quarters? And when should we assume that dynamic is going to be over? 
John McCallion: Jimmy, thanks for the question. Yes, I think it's pretty much in line in terms of the roll off of the -- given the roll-off of the cap. So in terms of XVII, that was generally in line. I think VII came in better than we expected. As you recall, we talked about a 115 to 140 spread range for the segment. So the middle of the range was 127 for the year.
 We still think that's the right answer. And the way we got there was that we have a kind of a quarterly roll off of these interest rate caps. Remember, we bought these back a while ago when there wasn't a risk of rising rates, but is to protect against a short-end rise fairly quickly so that it allows the long end to kind of emerge in over time. It's basically worked as planned. But they all effectively roll off for the most part throughout this year.
 So in terms of expectations, we will see another -- so I think it was 10 bps maybe decline between 4Q and 1Q. I think 8% to 10% next quarter is not a bad estimate. It will depend on what VII does next quarter. We still think VII has kind of a reemergence to occur. So we had a good quarter this quarter, but that can gradually grow throughout the year, probably a bigger growth in the second half and then probably have one more quarter of 8 to 10 bps occurring, and it flattens out between third and fourth quarter. Basically, it's minimal, if not immaterial roll off.
 So that's how to think about the roll off, and that's how we get to the midpoint of that range when we gave the guidance. So we -- obviously, in the past, we've spent quite a bit of time on XVII. We're happy to give that number, but we're really looking at the total spread all in now and as you think about the reemergence of VII. 
Jamminder Bhullar: Okay. And then for Ramy, on margins and Group Benefits. I think group life margin, you had assumed that they'd be weak in 1Q because of seasonality. Dental claims picked up as well. And do you attribute most of that to seasonality as well? Or are you seeing just higher incidents for some reason? 
Ramy Tadros: Jimmy, it's basically seasonality story. As you know, with dental claims, the benefits reset at the end of the calendar year. So come January, you just get to see more utilization as the claims reset. And therefore, that's just a seasonally higher ratio. If you look at our overall non-medical health ratio, this first quarter seasonality is baked into our guidance ranges. I remind you, these are annual ranges, and our expectations are at this point, that will be well within our range, 69% to 74% for the full year.
 And I would also remind you that we did lower that range by 1 point earlier this year. So very much a seasonality story and feel very good about being within that range for the full year. 
Operator: And next, we move to Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. 
Thomas Gallagher: Just a few follow-ups to Jimmy's questions. John, if I followed your math that would suggest about 20 basis points of lower base spreads for RIS versus Q1 level if I look at towards the end of 2024. Is that directionally right? 
John McCallion: Yes, 8 to 10, you took the top end of that range, but sure, it's close -- 16 to 20. 
Thomas Gallagher: 18 to 20? 
John McCallion: Yes. 
Thomas Gallagher: Okay. And then for -- and Ramy, for Group Benefits, I just want to make sure I have the right expectation here. The -- if I look at last year, and I look at the last 3 quarters of the year, I think earnings averaged around $450 million, that's probably $170 million, $180 million above what you did in Q1 this year. So is it fair to say you still expect to grow above the $450 million earnings level for the next 3 quarters?
 In other words, it was just worse seasonality this year. And then is it -- and said another way, it sounds like dental utilization was quite high. You fully expect to recover and see a big earnings snapback in dental for the balance of the year. 
Ramy Tadros: Tom, I mean the way you can triangulate to an earnings number is take our top line and our guidance ratio. So from a top line perspective, we're still very much within the 4% to 6% range. We got a 6% PFO growth this year -- this quarter, but think of that ratio being close to the midpoint of the range for the full year.
 And for sure, think of both non-medical health, which includes dental moderating for the full year. So think of that going towards the midpoint of the range. And think of the same thing happening with the life underwriting ratio. So very much a seasonality story for this quarter.
 Remember, as Michel alluded in his remarks, that seasonality was kind of masked in the last few years with COVID and different behaviors on the dental side and clearly on the mortality side in terms of what we've seen. And that's just now returning to a more regular pattern, if you will. So I hope that helps you think through the guidance growth, both given the top line number that I've articulated as well as the midpoint of these ratios for the full year? 
Thomas Gallagher: That does. And if I could just sneak in one other follow-up. So dental utilization, you would fully expect that to be far lower in 2Q than 1Q? Or is there going to be some tail on that where you might see some level of higher utilization and lower earnings into 2Q as well, would you say? 
Ramy Tadros: I mean Q3 tends to be the lightest. So you'd expect it to come down in the second quarter. Q3 will be a lot lighter. So there's going to be always -- there will be a decrease, whether it's going to happen as a sharp cliff in Q2 and then another one in Q3 or different pattern, it's hard to predict. But again, think of it as a full year range and think of that ratio coming to the midpoint for the full year. 
John McCallion: And Tom, maybe I'll just add a follow-up again on your first question. I mean, I think also just you only focused on XVII. But as I said, I think what's really important is that we think of the all-in spread here, and that's -- all of that is very much in line with what we gave in the outlook for the midpoint of the range. 
Operator: Next, we move on to Brian Meredith with UBS. 
Justin Tucker: This is Justin Tucker on for Brian. My first question is about RIS. When looking at the structured settlement results, could you kind of help us understand how much of the demand is driven by the favorable interest rate environment? And then how much of it is driven by the courts opening and social inflation?
 And then furthermore, just curious about the sensitivity to those factors. If interest rates do decrease, do you think that has a bigger impact on structured settlement demand versus a dampening of social inflation? 
Ramy Tadros: It's Ramy here. I mean I would say interest rates is the primary driver of this. You have seen coming out of the pandemic, call it, pent-up demand with the courts being closed and some of that clearly kind of did cause an increase in volumes earlier on. That's now stabilized, and it's very much an interest rate-driven volume increases.
 And you do have given court settlements have increased. You do have some social inflation component. But I would say interest rates is the primary one. We are a major player in this market. The market has grown substantially over the last few years, and we have maintained a pretty good share in that market. And it's a very specialized market in terms of the distribution channel, the underwriting, et cetera. And we're extremely pleased both with the volume, but as importantly, with the ROEs and the returns we're able to achieve in this market. 
Justin Tucker: Great. And then my follow-up question is just on Latin America. Sales were flat year-over-year. I'm just kind of curious about what you're seeing in the overall market for demand and what you expect with sales going forward? 
Eric Sacha Clurfain: Yes. Justin, thanks for the question. This is Eric. So overall, we're pleased really with our results this quarter. This is a good start of the year after what was a record year in 2023. The quarter's results are primarily driven by favorable underwriting, some of which we don't expect to recur strong encaje returns and solid volume growth.
 And to your question, from a top line perspective, we've seen all key markets contributing to the high solid -- high single-digit PFO growth, and that was supported by a solid sales and strong persistency. So from a sales perspective, specifically, this quarter is a tough compare given that last year, we had a 36% growth, which included 2 large employee benefits and corporate pension sales in Mexico and Brazil.
 Now if you exclude these 2 sales from 2023, our sales are up roughly 10% year-over-year. So all in all, we're really pleased with the growth trajectory and the momentum in the region. And we believe that the outlook guidance we provided is still a reasonable run rate for the remainder of the year. 
Operator: And we have no other questions. I'll be turning the conference back to John Hall for closing comments. 
John Hall: Great. Thank you very much, operator, and thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning on a very busy day. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's fourth quarter 2023 earnings and near-term outlook call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which addressed the quarter as well as our near-term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should similarly review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which will end promptly at the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As we begin 2023, I shared our conviction that despite the uncertain times, MetLife would exit the year stronger than we entered it. We accomplished this by countering the challenging environment with the actions we've taken to focus, simplify, and differentiate our business. We maintained an accelerated momentum in MetLife's diversified set of market-leading businesses, driving strong results for the year and the quarter. And we illustrated our financial strength and flexibility with sound transactions and well-timed capital management, ending the year with solid capital ratios and robust cash on hand. Clearly, our all-weather strategy stood up again in 2023. We remain steadfastly focused on what matters most in delivering for our customers and shareholders. In 2023, we exited a pandemic and have yet to enter a widely expected U.S. recession. We managed through a bank liquidity crisis and the resulting credit concerns. And we adapted to an inverted yield curve that has persisted longer than any in history. Against this backdrop, the fundamentals of our businesses are as strong as I have ever seen. Our successful 2023 is a testament to the resilience and durability of our business model, a relentless focus on execution, concentrating on the factors we control, our risk management culture and processes, the discipline we apply to managing our assets and liabilities, and the prudence of our investment portfolio. On that last point, the strength and stability of our commercial real estate portfolio, which we detailed a year ago, has borne out, as we said, a modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratios, and we expect that to remain true in 2024. For the year, we delivered an adjusted return on equity, excluding notable items, of 13.8%, achieving our target for this all-important metric. We were unwavering in our expense discipline, employing efficiency and agility to post a full year direct expense ratio of 12.2%. We upheld our commitment to responsible growth, directing capital to its highest and best use, with high teen IRRs and mid single-digit payback periods on new business. We returned $4.7 billion to shareholders via common stock dividends and share repurchases, and we continued to generate strong, recurring free cash flow and remain financially flexible with significant liquidity at our holding companies. The resilience of our strategy and the clarity of our purpose remain powerful drivers of MetLife's success. Our diversified portfolio of market-leading businesses is well positioned to perform for years to come. Backed by a strong balance sheet and our demonstrated ability to generate cash flow, I am confident in MetLife's ability to create value for shareholders and other stakeholders, and to deliver financial security to our customers as we have for over a century and a half. Now turning to our fourth quarter 2023 results, last night we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.83 per share. Excluding notable items, we reported $1.93 per share, up 21% compared to $1.59 per share a year ago. Again, this quarter, our businesses showed strong underlying momentum with excellent underwriting results. Also, our recurring investment income grew on higher balances and higher new money rates. Shifting to the full year 2023, the differentiation and scale across our market-leading businesses were among the factors that helped to fuel our underlying business fundamentals. We generated adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, of $5.6 billion. On the strength of new money yields, our adjusted net investment income grew 9% year-over-year to almost $20 billion, despite variable investment income falling below expectations. Adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers climbed 6%, with healthy growth across most business segments. Group Benefits posted adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, of $1.6 billion, up 22% from the prior year. The scale and breadth of this franchise business continues to drive organic growth and represents a clear point of competitive advantage. Sales gained 9%, while adjusted PFOs, excluding the impact of participating policies, rose roughly at 5%. We believe group PFO growth is sustainable at more than $1 billion per year. Higher interest rates serve as a tailwind to our leading Retirement and Income Solutions business, with new money yields exceeding roll-off rates for the past seven consecutive quarters. Volume growth in RIS away from PRT was very strong, with more than $5 billion of longevity, reinsurance sales and more than $3 billion of structured settlements. Pension risk transfers totaled $5.3 billion for the year, the third largest annual total in MetLife’s history. This followed an all-time record year in 2022, and we have a strong pipeline of new opportunities in 2024 and beyond. Sales growth in Asia remained strong, propelled by market demand in Japan for FX denominated life insurance products and a new cash value life product in Korea. Finally, Latin America continues to be a growing and important region for MetLife. Adjusted earnings on a reported basis in 2023 grew 15% over the prior year, and we've expanded our distribution capabilities as well as our product portfolio. One of the ways we hold ourselves accountable is against the Next Horizon commitments we made in 2019. On that basis, we are ahead of schedule to meet all criteria. In fact, we have even moved the goalpost on ourselves and raised the bar on certain of our Next Horizon commitments. For instance, we initially committed to an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14%, and last year we chose to push that target even higher, to 13% to 15%. And as you've seen within our outlook disclosure, we've further tightened our expense ratio target from 12.6% to 12.3%. While we have the strongest conviction in our Next Horizon strategy, we do not view it as a ceiling on our aspirations. We constantly look to set higher standards and position MetLife for even greater success. When I spoke of emerging from 2023 stronger our capital and cash is another prime example. During a year marked by periods of financial and geopolitical turmoil, our balance sheet strength enabled us to repurchase $3.1 billion of our common stock and increase our common stock dividend per share, paying out roughly $1.6 billion in common stock dividends. Even still, we enter 2024 with robust levels of cash and higher capital ratios in our key markets. Our capital management has carried into 2024, and we have repurchased roughly $0.5 billion of MET common shares in the month of January. We continue to have capacity for further action with approximately $1.6 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. There is no doubt MetLife's financial strength and financial flexibility was on full view during 2023, particularly with the execution of our $19 billion risk transfer transaction that closed in November. This will free up more than $3 billion of capital over time and illustrates the disciplined approach we apply to evaluating our portfolio of businesses. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash and liquid assets on our balance sheet, which is comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. We have consistently said that when responsible growth is attractive and available, we will deploy capital organically or inorganically. If not, we will return capital to our shareholders. I am pleased our Next Horizon strategy continues to prove its metal amid uncertainty. Looking ahead, whether driven by Fed policy and changes to the yield curve, geopolitical events, or the unfolding U.S. election cycle, it is prudent to anticipate more uncertainty in 2024. The supplemental slides we published last night include some near-term targets and elements of guidance. It should be playing to see that we anticipate the underlying momentum building across our businesses to continue. This is evident in our flagship Group Benefits business, where off a large embedded base we've established a strong growth outlook for premiums, fees and other revenues. And of further note, we've also increased our expectations for both group life and non-medical health margins. Importantly, the outlook that we've provided reflects the world as we see it, not as we wish it to be. In that context, we assume a more modest private equity return of high-single digits in the near term, down from the 12% assumption we have used in prior years. Private equity remains an important contributor to our well-tested asset-liability matching program. It is an asset class well suited to defeat long-term liabilities, and our historical track record has been very strong. In closing, when we launched our Next Horizon strategy in 2019, we could not have predicted the many challenges we would face in the markets where we operate. But our unyielding execution against our strategy is serving us and our many stakeholders well, allowing us to positively impact our customers and live our purpose. Our 2023 results reflect our capacity to move ahead with urgency and deliver on our strategy. We saw very good underlying business performance supported by a strong capital base. We will continue to concentrate on controlling what we can control, balance sheet security, responsible growth, expense efficiency and capital deployment among others. In the final year of the Next Horizon strategy time frame, we believe our past progress positions us to reach for new heights not possible four years ago. I am energized for the future of MetLife driven by the continued momentum I see building in our businesses for 2024 and beyond. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q 2023 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update of our liquidity and capital positions as well as our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. In addition, I will discuss our near-term outlook in more detail. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement losses in the fourth quarter was due to the decline in long-term interest rates. Net derivative gains were only a partial offset as the favorable impact from lower long-term interest rates were mitigated by changes in short-term interest rates and higher equity markets in the quarter. For the full year, the variance between net income and adjusted earnings was mostly attributable to net derivative losses, primarily due to stronger equity markets, changes in foreign currencies and higher interest rates in 2023. In addition, net investment losses were largely the result of normal trading activity on the portfolio in a rising interest rate environment as well as the mark-to-market impact on securities that were transferred as part of the reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. Overall, the portfolio remains well positioned with modest levels of credit losses and the hedging program continues to perform as expected. On Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $76 million after tax, of an unfavorable notable item relating to asbestos litigation reserves in 4Q of 2023 that was accounted for in corporate and other. There were no notable items in the prior year quarter. Regarding the asbestos reserve increase of $76 million, based on our latest review, while we continue to observe a declining claim count, the frequency of severe claims related to asbestos has not declined as expected. The total reserve is $364 million at the end of 2023. Adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items were $1.4 billion, up 14% and 12% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were strong recurring interest margins, higher variable investment income, or VII, volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding total notable items were $1.93, up 21% and 19% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $466 million, up 19% versus the prior year period. The key drivers were favorable life underwriting margins and solid volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 83.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.3% and below the bottom end of our 2023 target range of 85% to 90%. Consistent with CDC U.S. mortality data, we saw a much lower number of life claims than typical in the fourth quarter. Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 70.7% in the quarter, and at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. We expect both the life mortality ratio and the non-medical health ratio to be higher in Q1 given the seasonality of the business. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs on a full year basis were up 3% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 200 basis points. The underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition, Group Benefits 2023 sales were up 9% year-over-year. The continued strong growth is primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. RIS adjusted earnings were $421 million, up 10% year-over-year. The primary drivers were favorable investment margins due to higher recurring interest and variable investment income as well as favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads were 121 basis points. Spreads, excluding VII were 134 basis points, up 10 points versus Q4 of 2022, primarily due to higher interest rates as well as income from in-the-money interest rate caps. RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers were up 75% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products and post-retirement benefits as well as growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we added transactions worth approximately $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to roughly $5.3 billion. This marks the third highest PRT sales year for MetLife, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $296 million, up 12% and 11% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher investment margins and lower taxes. For Asia's key growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were essentially flat versus the prior year quarter. For the full year, Asia’s sales were up 13%, driven by strong growth across the region, exceeding its 2023 guidance range of mid to high-single digits. Latin America adjusted earnings were $207 million, up 13% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to solid volume growth partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins versus a strong Q4 2022. In addition, LatAm had favorable Chilean encaje returns of 7.9% in 4Q of 2023 versus 6.1% in the prior year quarter. Latin America’s top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 29% and 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong sales and solid persistency across the region. For the full year, adjusted PFOs were also up 29% on a reported basis and 19% on a constant currency basis, exceeding LatAm’s 2023 guidance of low-double digit growth. EMEA adjusted earnings were $47 million, down 27% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily driven by an unfavorable tax charge following a favorable tax benefit in the prior year period, as well as less favorable expense and underwriting margins. This was partially offset by higher recurring interest margins year-over-year. EMEA full year 2023 adjusted earnings of $265 million exceeded our outlook expectations of roughly $55 million per quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis and sales were up 18% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $156 million, down 15%, largely driven by foregone earnings as a result of the reinsurance transaction that closed in November. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $156 million, excluding the unfavorable notable item of $76 million after-tax that I referenced earlier. This compares to an adjusted loss of $210 million in the prior year. Higher net investment income and favorable taxes were the primary drivers. The company’s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 19%, which includes favorable tax benefits primarily related to the true up of the federal tax return to provision. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2023. VII was $63 million in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by positive returns in our corporate and mortgage loan funds. The private equity portfolio and real estate equity funds had a combined return of essentially zero in the quarter. For the full year, VII was $419 million, well below our 2023 target of approximately $2 billion. That said, while mark-to-market returns were below expectation in 2023, the PE portfolio generated approximately $2 billion in cash distributions during the year. On Page 6, we provide VII post tax by segment for the prior four quarters and full year 2023. As reflected in the chart, RIS, Asia and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets, given their long dated liability profile. Now, turning to Page 7, the chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past three years, as well as Q4 of 2022 versus Q4 of 2023. While VII has had lower than trend returns over the last couple of years, recurring income, which accounted for most of the net investment income in 2023 was up approximately $2.6 billion year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. The expansion of recurring income in 2023 more than offset the lower VII year-over-year. Shifting your attention to the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yield since 4Q of 2020, new money yields continue to outpace roll-off yields over the past couple of years, consistent with rising rates. In this quarter, our global new money yield continued its upward trajectory coming in at 6.67%, 142 basis points higher than the roll-off yield. Turning to Page 8. I’ll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform consistent with expectations, where we expect higher quality assets to outperform the asset sector broadly. The average LTV on our CML portfolio now stands at 64% as of December 31, up slightly from 63% in the third quarter of 2023, and the average debt service coverage ratio remains steady at 2.3 times. The modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratio are further indicators of the disciplined approach we take to investing in this asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong with only 2.6% of loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than one times. With regards to CML loan maturities, we resolved 100% of the loans that were scheduled to mature in 2023. Our expectation going forward remains for modest credit losses on the portfolio. Turning to Page 9. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior eight quarters and full year 2022 and 2023. Our direct expense ratio in 4Q of 2023 was up modestly at 12.4%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs in group benefits as well as higher employee related costs. That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2023, our direct expense ratio was 12.2% below our 2023 target of 12.6%. We believe this result once again demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset in a challenging inflationary environment, while continuing to make investments in our businesses. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.2 billion at December 31, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of roughly $900 million in the fourth quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we repurchased shares totaling approximately $500 million in January. For the two-year period 2022 and 2023, our average free cash flow ratio, excluding notable items totaled 74% and was within our 65% to 75% target range. In terms of statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, our combined 2023 NAIC, RBC ratio is still preliminary but expected to be approximately 400% and above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.5 billion, while net income was approximately $3.9 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.9 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting and impacts from the reinsurance transaction. This was partially offset by higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2023, up 10% for September 30, 2023, primarily due to operating earnings and the impacts of the reinsurance transaction. This was partially offset by dividends paid. Finally, we expect that Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 720% as of December 31, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Before I shift to our near-term outlook starting on Page 12, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 17 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2018 through 2022. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q 2023 supplemental slides, but we feel it's worth including again for the sake of completeness. Also, pages 18 through 21 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business. Now let's turn to Page 12 for further details on our near-term outlook. Starting with the overview. We expect continued uncertainty to persist around inflation and unemployment in 2024. We expect the U.S. dollar to stabilize around current levels. Based on the 12/31/2023 forward curve, we assume long-term interest rates to be largely unchanged in 2024, and the yield curve will move from inverted to modestly upward sloping as short-term interest rates decline and we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500. For our near-term targets, we are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 13% to 15%. We expect to maintain our two-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. Also, given continued focus on expense discipline, building capacity to reinvest in growth initiatives, and our overall efficiency mindset, we are lowering our direct expense ratio guidance for 2024 from 12.6% to 12.3%. Specifically, for 2024, VII expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. Our corporate and other adjusted loss target is expected to be $750 million to $850 million after tax in 2024. This represents an approximately $100 million increase from our prior adjusted loss guidance of $650 million to $750 million in 2023. The higher range reflects C&O's current run rate given the impact of a higher rate environment on interest expense and pension costs, as well as the impact of lower expected benefits from VII. We are increasing our expected effective tax rate range by two points to 24% to 26% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets with higher tax rates and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you will see certain interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, reflecting a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near-term. On Page 13, the chart reflects our VII average asset balances from $18 billion in 2022 to $19.7 billion expected in 2024. Private equity investments will continue to represent the vast majority of our VII asset balances. We are reducing our near-term expected annual returns for private equity to be between 7% to 10% and we are also lowering our expected returns for real estate and other funds to be in the range of 5% to 7% over the near-term. We expect PE and real estate returns will remain pressured in the first quarter of 2024 before trending higher. Finally, as a reminder, we include prepayment fees on fixed maturities and mortgage loans in VII. So now, I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Let's start with the U.S. on Page 14. For group benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating group life contracts of approximately $300 million in 2023, adjusted PFOs are expected to grow at 4% to 6% annually over the near-term. And for 2024 we expect growth to be in the top half of that range. This reflects the strong momentum in the business, particularly in voluntary products, as well as exceptionally strong persistency in our national accounts. Regarding underwriting, we expect 2024 underwriting margins to be generally consistent with 2023. As such, we are reducing our near-term group life mortality ratio and non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio ranges by 1 percentage point to 84% to 89% and 69% to 74%, respectively. Finally, keep in mind these are annual ratios and both typically skew to the higher end of the ranges in the first quarter given the seasonality of the business. For RAS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. Regarding investment spread, full year 2023 was 125 basis points and is expected to be relatively flat for the full year of 2024. This incorporates both the impact of the roll off of our interest rate caps with maturities throughout 2024 and the offsetting benefit of VII re-emerging over the year as a more meaningful contributor. As such, we expect the investment spread range for 2024 is 115 to 140 basis points. We have also provided updated RAS sensitivities for interest rate movements in the appendix. Sensitivities reflect the anticipated impact from interest rate cap maturities throughout 2024. As such, our sensitivity to SOFR declines throughout the year. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline by approximately 13% to 15% in 2024 and then declining 4% to 6% annually thereafter. And we are lowering the adjusted earnings guidance range to $700 million to $900 million in 2024 to reflect the foregone earnings from the reinsurance transaction as well as lower expected PE returns and natural runoff of the business. Now, let’s look at the near-term guidance of our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 15. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid-single digit growth over the near-term. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid-single digit growth. We are expecting adjusted earnings to grow roughly 20% in 2024 as we assume VII to have a greater impact throughout the year. We are maintaining mid-single digit adjusted earnings growth expectation over the remainder of the near-term. For Latin America, we expect both adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings to grow by high single digits over the near-term. Finally, for EMEA, we’re expecting sales to grow mid- to high-single digits and adjusted PFOs to grow mid-single digits over the near-term. The forward curve assumes a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in EMEA. As such, we project EMEA’s adjusted earnings run rate to be roughly $60 million to $65 million per quarter in 2024 and then grow by mid-single digits in 2025 and 2026 based on the forward curve for these currencies. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a solid quarter to close out another strong year. The underlying strength of our business fundamentals remains on display with strong top line growth coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. While VII remains below historical returns, core spreads remain robust and continue to benefit from the higher yield environment. While the current environment remains uncertain, we are excited about the outlook and growth prospects for our businesses over the near-term and beyond. MetLife continues to move forward from a position of strength with a strong balance sheet, recurring free cash flow generation and a diversified set of our market leading businesses. And we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the ROE target. And I recognize that you just raised the target by 100 basis points a year ago to 13% to 15%. But it seems like your segment outlook would suggest something at least a bit above 15%, maybe something closer to 15.5%. So I guess I just wanted to hear your perspective on, am I thinking about that incorrectly or is there some potential upside to this ROE based on the current trends you’re seeing?
John McCallion: Good morning, Ryan, it’s John. I think we wouldn’t debate your model calculations there. I think it’s fair to say that we certainly are trending to the high end of that range, if not with a plus sign. But we just moved it a year ago and I think we’ll take a year here and take stock at that time. But I’d say – I think just maybe just to help you with that. One other thing is, like I said, we’ll take stock. We think over time, and we’ve been talking about this, that there has been kind of – as a result of higher rates, there has been a shift in volume and returns on our business. So it wouldn’t preclude us from doing it again. I think we want to take some time to take stock.
Ryan Krueger: Understood. Makes sense. And then I think you said you expected the RBC ratio to be around 400%. Would have thought it would have been maybe a little higher than that following the reinsurance transaction. Do you have any more color on if there were any offsets?
Michel Khalaf: Yes, I think when we announced the deal, we thought this would give us 50 points to 60 points. We still think it will. There’s a little bit of what happens immediately and then how things trend in over time. Also, there’s a lot of other things going on, fungibility, growth. We had some very sizable growth in RAS. So, we deployed some extra capital this year. So, I think a lot of those things. But in terms of the deal economics that we outlined at time of signing, everything came in as expected.
Ryan Krueger: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Yes, thanks, and appreciate all the color on the guidance. But maybe if we could just circle back to consolidated recurring NII, I think you talked about a pretty big lift in 2023 relative to 2022, that $19.3 billion. Any help in terms of what you think that could look like given all of the moving pieces as we think about 2024?
John McCallion: Hey, Suneet, it’s John. It’s a good question. I mean, sometimes, NII, it’s a helpful metric, certainly from, I’d say mix and just to show that higher rates have more than offset or actually offset some of the depression and VII. And I think the point of that slide is to show that there’s more power there once things kind of re emerge on the VII front. Sometimes it’s a little hard with just translating NII to earnings. So, we’re a little cautious on necessarily given a target around that because, we have different products that perform well in different environments and ultimately to spread. So I think we’re a little hesitant to kind of forecast for you. I think the point of that slide was to indicate that it shows the growth in our business. It shows that we’re well diversified. We can perform well in a variety of economic environments. And I think that’s really probably the theme to take away. So sorry, I didn’t get to maybe your exact question or answer, but that’s probably the best I can do.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then as we think about the benefit of the caps in 2023 and what that looks like in 2024 as they roll off? Should we think about the improvement in VII as essentially like those two kind of net as a wash? Or is one kind of greater than the other? I just want to get some additional color on that if we could.
John McCallion: Yes, it’s a great question. I think what you just said at the end around in terms of them being a wash is a pretty good way of thinking about it. So, we had 125 basis points last year, all-in for 2023. We gave a range of 115 basis points to 140 basis points for next year. I think the midpoint is a little above. It’s at 127 basis points, I guess if you did the math. And our view is the interest rate caps will roll off throughout the year and then VII will emerge throughout the year and essentially offset the decline there. And so we think the best way to think about the spreads for the year is relatively flat to what you saw for the full year of 2023. It will give and take here and there. As we point out on the slide, we think VII in the first quarter will continue to be pressured. Obviously, the caps haven’t fully rolled off yet, so we’ll still have income from them. And then as VII merges, you’ll see the caps roll off and they’ll essentially offset.
Suneet Kamath: Okay, that’s helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Next, we have a question from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Hi. So your assumed alternative returns are now around 7.5% for 2024. And I think the RBC risk charge, if I was to do a weighted average, would be 15% to 20% on most of that portfolio. Have you considered pivoting some of the portfolio into assets with comparable, let’s say, 7% yields, like private credit or just other fixed income, but much lower risk charges? I’m just thinking about it from the perspective of we’ve had two years of underperformance, your outlook for a third year is below those levels, and rates are higher. And if I think about both your cost of capital and ROE, I think it would be a fairly meaningful positive. Not recognizing you can’t do this overnight, but is that something you consider pivoting or shifting to? Thanks.
John McCallion: Hey good morning, Tom, it’s John. I think the last point you made around you can’t do this overnight is an important piece, but I think direction of travel, that’s probably fair point. And I think we’ve talked about the fact that we are in a different rate environment. So the relative value of investments are probably different than where they were when it was lower for longer. We pride ourselves in diversification. So it’s not that we would make an abrupt shift, but we do believe that making some tweaks to allocations is appropriate in different environments. And I think what you’re referencing is one that we would lean towards. It’s an asset class where you have prior commitments and those – then get deployed judiciously. And actually there's probably some really good opportunities right now that we're leveraging. Having said that, we think distributions will likely outpace new contributions just given our revised level of new commitments. And I think over time you would see a moderate shift in allocation in that asset class versus others.
Tom Gallagher: Okay, thanks. And then just a question on Group Benefits, the 100 basis point improvement in the margin target, or at least the loss ratio targets. Can you comment on what's driving that? Is that stable pricing, sustainably higher disability or lower disability loss ratios, and maybe a little bit on the Group Life side, what you're thinking? Thanks.
Ramy Tadros: Good morning, Tom. It's Ramy here. And I would say at the highest level in terms of our near-term outlook here is, this is driven by the changing business mix, both in terms of the customer segments that we serve as well as the products that we offer. So from a customer perspective, we've executed well on our strategy to target higher growth in regional markets. We're seeing the benefits of that. In terms of growth, regional markets has grown two to three percentage points higher than the overall average, and we see a clear path for that growth to continue. And regional market is a segment that does carry a lower loss ratio across both the life underwriting ratio and non-medical health. And we're also seeing a shift from a product perspective. We've executed well on our employee paid strategy in general, and voluntary strategy in particular and in voluntary we've seen double-digit growth over many years and we expect that to persist in the future given customer needs and the opportunity to drive penetration in the workplace. And the loss ratio here tends to be also more favorable to the overall portfolio. So between that customer segment and that product view, if you think about this over time, we feel kind of a shift to the outlook is warranted. Let me tell you what it's not been driven by. On the Life ratio, this quarter was very favorable and it's really driven, as John pointed out, to the population mortality experience. So this is not one quarter makes a trend, this is one quarter here that was favorable. And we do expect the Q1 numbers to tick up given the seasonality of Life claims. And then on the disability side, our outlook in terms of the ratios does include an expectation that the profitability of our disability line of business will moderate over time. But that is outweighed by the other factors that I've just mentioned. And back to Q1 as well, there – just remember, there's also seasonality in that ratio in Q1 given the seasonality of the dental business. So net-net, think about it as business mix, customer and product mix. That's really driving this shift downwards in the ranges.
Tom Gallagher: That's helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: So the first question on retirement spreads. Can you discuss the driver of the sequential decline in spreads each of the last two quarters? And how much of this is being driven by mix of business versus maybe competition, because what we're seeing is your yields have gone up, but crediting rates seem to be rising even faster than that?
John McCallion: Good morning, Jimmy. It's John. The simple answer just sequentially for us is the lower rates late in the quarter caused a bit of compression on the spread number. Just how – we had the caps were in the money and lower rates were – came in. So it was different than the forward curve at the time of the third quarter when we gave the 135 to 140 range came in at 134 xviii. So that's the main driver. It's not pricing. Pricing has actually been pretty healthy, relatively speaking, we haven't seen any change in pricing. So anything – if anything, it's really just a simple change in the curve.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on the CRE portfolio, you mentioned resolving all of the maturities for 2023. Can you give us a sense of how much of your book is coming due over the next one to two years, especially in office properties? And as you're resolving these loans, are you having to extend more of them than you've done in the past, or are you resolving them similar to how you would have done it over the last several years?
John McCallion: Yes, sure. Jimmy, it's John again. So, just as a reminder, for 2023, just rough percentages of the resolution. About 30% was payoff or refinance. Another 60% was these contractual extensions where the borrower has to be in good financial condition. We have some pretty high level of requirements there. So those are contractual. If you meet those requirements, then you have the right. And they generally be – tend to be more floating rate nature loans, where they're just waiting to lock in fixed rates. There's less than 10% on just, I'll say, maturity extensions. Where we agree with the borrower, there's a good positive situation for us to extend, and then there's kind of a couple of points of foreclosures. In terms of 2024, about 10% of the balance comes due. In terms of maturities, the overall PBO that we have, I'd say that in terms of resolutions, probably a similar mix to what we saw in terms of percentage. And I think in terms of – we gave a little bit of magnitude this past year in terms of what we thought were at risk loans and level of charge offs. Our view in 2024 is that we'd see a similar order of magnitude on both loans at risks and level of charge offs as well.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the PRT side. I think we've stopped seeing why the seasonality where deals know much more weighted to the fourth quarter. So just trying to get a sense of your outlook for 2024 and how we should think about the cadence of potential transactions there?
Ramy Tadros: Good morning, Elyse. It's Ramy here. I think you're right to point out that kind of the, we've seen less of that seasonality where we're seeing deals being done throughout the year. Our outlook there remains pretty positive. We continue to see a very healthy pipeline, in particular, a pipeline at the larger end of the market where we are most competitive. And all the macro indicators in terms of what DB plan sponsors are saying, in terms of the funding level, the magnitude of assets sitting in frozen defined benefit plan all kind of indicate expectations of continued kind of high level of activity in this market into 2024. So no change in terms of our view of the robustness of the pipeline and look, if you step back and look at RIS more broadly, the liability exposures are up 3% year-over-year. And most of that growth is coming from our spread and in general account business, which is actually growing at 4%, and that's coming off 2022, where we had the $8 billion PRT deal. And that growth is not just PRT. I mean, PRT was about $5.3 billion, but we're also seeing continued strength across a range of spread-based products, be they structured settlements and be they some of our products in our risk solutions business, and so on.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question: how should we think about dividends to parent that you guys could take in 2024, as you could look to upstream the capital that you guys are getting from the Holdings transaction?
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Hi, Elyse, it's Michel. Thanks for the question. So we talked about the reinsurance transaction as providing us with significant financial flexibility. And as you heard from John, our RBC ratio is approximately 400%. And I would just note here that the 5.2 Holdco cash does not yet include any of the reinsurance proceeds. So the excess capital is sitting in our statutory entities and it will ultimately migrate to the Holdco. We view excess capital as fungible and we will redeploy it over time. And in the absence of attractive organic or inorganic growth opportunities as I think we've built a good track record in terms of being deliberate and expeditious, post major divestitures and how we return capital to shareholders. And as you've seen since we closed on the transaction, we've leaned into buybacks especially in January. I wouldn't sort of consider January as monthly run rate for the full year, but we're going to continue to be opportunistic here. Hope that helps.
John McCallion: And I would just add Elyse, I mean, just too kind of put a finer point on just the financial flexibility and the fungibility of that, I mean, we might, because we have excess capital at the OpCo, we might think differently at the Holdco, it'll depend, right? I mean, I don't think we have to necessarily have it all at the Holdco. We have a range of 3 to 4. It might give us some ability to manage more differently within that range because we have access at the OpCos, I think we just want to, I think the flexibility is the key point.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott: Hi, good morning. First, what I have for you is just going back to the VII guide quickly. Could you frame for us how much of the lower VII guide is maybe a little more specific to first quarter VII and what you see in results that you sort of already have eyes on since it's lagged, as opposed level setting, like the ongoing expectation?
John McCallion: Hey, good morning, Alex, it's John. I'd love to say that we have great insights into the, as a result of having the lag, but I'm not so sure that has proven out the way we thought it would each quarter. I think all we know is that we think, we kind of believe that it'll bump along the, kind of the bottom again before becoming a more meaningful contributor in the outer quarters. We think managers, even though the S&P jumped up in the quarter; it was kind of late in the quarter. We believe managers will be a bit cautious in their yearend remarks and maybe remain conservative before writing investments up based on some of the public market multiples. So that's kind of our base case assumption. We don't have a lot of insight yet in actual financial statements that have come through. So obviously those will come through as we move through the quarter.
Alex Scott: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Maybe for a second one just on what you saw around pricing in group benefits, maybe in the U.S., and LatAm, around yearend enrollment and so forth. I mean, margins are really good. Are you seeing any competition that's starting to heat up there?
Ramy Tadros: Thanks, Alex. It's Ramy here. I would say we're really off to a strong start in 2024. If you look at 2023, overall sales were up 9% year-over-year, as John mentioned. And we saw a very strong persistency in line with our expectations. And we also saw the rate actions that we were able to take also in line with our expectations across market segments. So while there is competition and it is a competitive market, when we think about pricing as well as persistency, I think all the non price factors of differentiations that we've talked about in the past are playing into our favor here. And we've been able to hold margins and as you've seen, we've expanded the margin outlook. One, [ph] I can give you a bit of a flavor on that. We're still in the midst of it, but initial indications in terms of our sales growth are in the 5% to 10% again year-over-year with really solid growth across the product portfolio, across both core and voluntary. So these are really good indicators for us both in terms of volume and margin as we look into 2024.
Alex Scott: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
John Barnidge: Good morning. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Maybe sticking with group benefits. Can you maybe talk about growth in employee counts among your corporate partners, whether it's larger and the small or the jumbo in maybe a viewpoint of one-one renewals with that. Thank you.
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Hey, John, I don't have that number handy. Specifically in terms of employee count. The best thing you could look at for an indicator for that is just overall employment levels because we have a very diversified book up and down market. It's highly diversified by industry. So you could think of us as reflecting the broader economy in terms of our employee count. But the one that I would look at more closely is, and this is where we see a lot of white space with respect to employee counts, is the penetration rate in the workspace. We still see plenty of opportunity to drive penetration of our own products, be they voluntary or employee paid. And that's through the deployment of the right technology, the right tools, the right engagement capabilities. And that's really what's been fueling our voluntary growth over the past few years. And that's where we see continued future growth opportunities.
John Barnidge: Thank you for that. My follow up question you talked about the frequency of asbestos claims hasn't declined as expected. Can you maybe talk about that versus what the assumption was? Thank you.
John McCallion: Yes. Hey, good morning, John. It's John. So, as we said, this is something that we look at each third or fourth quarter where we conduct our experience study. This is an exposure where there is a declining claim count, but what hasn't declined as expected or as fast as expected is some of the severe claims. So the larger claims, and that's really what we trued up this quarter. Again, it's kind of a runoff claim count exposure. We've been seeing that for some time. But in the last 12 months, we just saw a slightly different trend that we needed to adjust for. I mean the overall reserves just above 350 million.
John Barnidge: Thank you very much.
Operator: And I'll now turn the conference back to John hall for closing remarks.
John Hall: Great. Thank you, Operator. And thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will now turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's third quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin, I’d point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Also last night, we released a set of supplemental slides which addressed the quarter. The slides are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features GAAP reconciliations and other information which you should similarly review. As usual, after prepared remarks, we will host a Q&A session. We will end Q&A just prior to the top of the hour. In fairness to everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. As you can see from the report we posted last night, MetLife delivered another quarter of strong underlying results with sustained business momentum. MetLife's capacity to perform across a wide range of economic scenarios, there's a testament to the resilience of our all-weather strategy and is characterized by our unyielding focus on execution. And concentrating on those elements within our control, such as balance sheet security, investment performance, reserve adequacy, responsible growth, expense efficiency and capital deployment to name just a few, we have positioned MetLife to generate significant value for our shareholders and other stakeholders for many years to come. Turning to the quarter. We reported adjusted earnings of $1.5 billion or $1.97 per share. Notable items in the quarter included our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, which had a positive impact of only $14 million or $0.02 per share on adjusted earnings. Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings per share were $1.95, up 43% from a year ago. As we previously indicated Variable investment income of $179 million fell below our quarterly outlook expectation. Private equity returns totaled 1.4%, while real estate equity risk trailed at minus 3%. In the aggregate, net income for the third quarter was $422 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period. The third quarter result reflects the negative impact of certain required accounting adjustments associated with our previously announced reinsurance transaction. Net derivative losses related to interest rate and foreign exchange hedges helped to protect our balance sheet further reduce net income. Our investment portfolio has stayed up in quality and continues to perform well. Underscoring that quality, the credit metrics associated with our real estate portfolio remain largely unchanged sequentially and we did not incur material credit losses during the third quarter. Moving to MetLife's business performance in the quarter. I will start with our US Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items totaled $483 million an all-time high and up 16% from a year ago. Underwriting results in the quarter for both Group Life and Non-Medical Health were outstanding. Year-to-date sales are up 11% while adjusted PFOs are up more than 4% in the quarter reflecting the impact of our contracts and within our 4% to 6% outlook range which we expect to achieve for the full year. In Group Benefits, we have invested significantly to integrate with the employer benefits ecosystem and enhance our enrollment capabilities and perhaps more important our reenrollment capabilities. With a significant portion of our overall sales and group benefits coming from employee paid products, our efforts to enhance enrollment and take-up rates are critical. Speaking of enrollment we are about to enter open enrollment season. This is an important opportunity to review our employee benefit needs and refresh selections for the upcoming year something I encourage all of you to do. Several of the investments that I referenced aim to make this process easier for participants. Further, we are activating emerging technologies that will help accelerate some of our group benefits initiatives particularly around underwriting claims and the customer experience. We believe the impact of these investments will enable us over time to further leverage our size to drive greater scale advantage. Looking to Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS adjusted earnings excluding notable items totaled $409 million up 60% from the prior year driven by higher recurring interest margins, better variable investment income and higher asset bases. Sales in the quarter were very strong across a range of products including pension risk transfer with roughly $1.5 billion booked as well as structured settlements and UK longevity reinsurance. We are poised to generate close to $3 billion or more of sales in each of these two high-return product categories for the full year.  Just after the close of the third quarter we released our 2023 pension risk transfer poll an example of our thought leadership in the space which we have been publishing for the past eight years. The poll which serve plan sponsors with derisking goals revealed several important observations relevant to the growth prospect for the PRT market. Let me offer some examples. Following record PRT sales in 2022, market activity is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Among companies who plan to derisk nine of 10 companies plan to completely divest all their defined benefit pension plan liabilities. And finally, 85% of plan sponsors expressed concern over missing an attractive window to secure an annuity buyout at competitive rates. These findings confirm what I have said before we should continue to see a strong pipeline for our pension risk transfer business. Now shifting over to Asia. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items of $369 million were 23% above a year ago on better variable investment income. Sales in the region on a constant currency basis were up 5% led by life insurance in Japan and Korea. For Latin America, adjusted earnings excluding notable items totaled $199 million. Further Latin America posted healthy 16% gains in both sales and adjusted PFOs on a constant currency basis. Our digital initiatives don't stop at the U.S. border they extend around the world for instance in Latin America we launched a digital platform that seamlessly integrates insurance solutions into the customer journeys of our LatAm business partners, such as banks, financial institutions, retailers and others, which we expect will lead to even more responsible growth in the region over time. Expanding on the subject of responsible growth. In the third quarter, we released our Value of New Business, or VNB statistics for the full year 2022. And the results are powerful. To summarize, MetLife's deployed roughly $3.7 billion of capital to support the origination of new business in 2022. This capital was put to work at an average internal rate of return of 17% with an expected payback period of approximately six years. The value of new business generated in 2022 is around $2.3 billion which represents the net present value of distributable cash flows in excess of the hurdle rate. When we reference terms of MetLife like responsible growth and disciplined capital deployment their application in our business is grounded in the systematic use of VNB. It is hard to overestimate the positive impact this analytical tool has had in managing our business starting with the deeply embedded practice of using IRRs and product pricing and ending with the establishment of business unit level VNB goals and targets. Simply put VNB guides our effort to target and prioritize capital efficient and shorter payback business and measure our progress and success in doing so. Over time, we've sought to maintain the right balance of capital deployment across organic growth acquisitions and share repurchase to drive value for shareholders. While we bought back $11.1 billion of our shares and executed $2 billion of acquisitions from 2019 to 2022. We similarly deployed $13.5 billion to support responsible growth over the same period. Moving to quarterly capital and cash MetLife remained active with capital management during the third quarter. We paid about $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders and we repurchased nearly $800 million of our common stock. In addition to our activity in the third quarter, we repurchased roughly another $250 million of our common stock during the month of October. Year-to-date through October we have repurchased about $2.5 billion of our common shares and there is approximately $2.7 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.9 billion of cash at our holding companies, which is above the top end of the $3 billion to $4 billion liquidity buffer we maintain. Before I close, let me provide a quick update on our pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. At this juncture, we have received all necessary regulatory approvals and we expect to close in short order. We do not anticipate any material changes to the terms announced in May. In closing, we hosted a strategy session with our Board of Directors during the first week of October. This recurring annual meeting presents us with an opportunity to pressure test our strategy and to assess progress made toward our next Horizon investor commitments. On that front, we are on track to exceed each commitment made at our December 2019 Investor Day and I am confident. we will continue to deliver for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance in greater detail.
John McCallion : Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 3Q '23 supplemental slides which provide highlights of our financial performance including details of our Annual Global Actuarial assumption review. In addition, I'll provide updates on our value of new business metrics, our liquidity and capital positions, as well as our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net investment losses include the mark-to-market impact on securities that are expected to be transferred with the pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic that we announced at the end of May. For GAAP purposes any increase in gross unrealized losses on these securities are required to be realized through net income until we close the transaction. Also, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio, given the rising interest rate environment. In addition, we had net derivative losses due to higher interest rates and strengthening of the US dollar versus multiple currencies, primarily the Chilean peso and yen. That said, net derivative losses were partially offset this quarter by market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement gains due to higher interest rates. Overall, the portfolio remains well positioned. Credit losses continued to be modest and the hedging program performed as expected. The table on page four provides highlights of our Annual Actuarial Assumption Review and other insurance adjustments with a breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business. Overall, the impact to adjusted earnings and net income was negligible. In Group Benefits, we had a favorable impact from assumption changes in individual disability, primarily due to lower incident rates and favorable recoveries. In Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, we lowered our near-term assumption for mortality improvement which resulted in an economic benefit, given the longevity products in this business. In Asia, the net unfavorable impact was due to lapse rate changes across life and accident & health products in Japan, as well as lowering lapse rates and expected fund returns for variable life products in Korea. On page five, you can see the third quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items associated with the Annual Assumption Review and other insurance adjustments in both periods. Adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion up 35% and 33% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were higher variable investment income or VII, strong recurring interest margins and favorable underwriting margins. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.95, up 43% and 40% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the US. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $483 million, up 16% versus the prior year period. The key drivers were favorable underwriting margins and solid volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 83.6% favorable to the prior year quarter of 85.7% and below the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. As a reminder, mortality results tend to be more favorable in the third quarter, so we would expect our Group Life ratio to be back within the 85% to 90% range in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 69% in the quarter or 70.4% excluding the favorable impact related to the annual assumption review that I mentioned earlier and at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account which dampened growth by roughly 1%, the underlying PFO were up approximately 4% year-over-year, primarily due to solid growth across most products. Including continued strong momentum in voluntary and was within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition Group Benefit sales were up 11% year-to-date driven by strong growth across most products and markets. RIS adjusted earnings were $409 million, up 60% year-over-year. The primary driver was favorable investment margins due to higher recurring interest and variable investment income. Solid volume growth year-over-year also contributed to the strong performance. RIS investment spreads were 130 basis points. Spreads excluding VII were 138 basis points, up 26 points versus Q3 of 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates as well as income from in-the-money interest rate caps. RIS adjusted PFOs excluding pension risk transfers were up 75% primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products, growth in UK longevity reinsurance, and postretirement benefits. With regards to PRT we added transactions worth approximately $1.5 billion in Q3 of 2023, bringing our year-to-date total to roughly $3.5 billion. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $369 million, up 23% and 25% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher investment margins. Asia's key growth metrics were solid as journal on assets under management on an amortized cost basis as well as sales both grew 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across most of the region. In Japan, sales on a constant currency basis were up 3% year-over-year, driven by strong life sales due to the ongoing momentum of a single premium FX Life product that was relaunched April 1st of this year. In other Asia sales on a constant currency basis were up 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong life sales in Korea in advance of a prospective regulatory change that took place on September 1st, that impacts low cash value whole life products. Looking ahead, while we anticipate Asia year-over-year sales will decline in the fourth quarter, we expect full year 2023 sales growth to be at the top end or exceed our annual guidance range of mid- to high single-digits. Latin America adjusted earnings were $199 million up 26% and 8% on a constant currency basis primarily due to solid volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. Latin America's topline continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 32% and 16% on a constant currency basis. And sales were also up 16% on a constant currency basis driven by strong growth in Mexico and Chile and solid persistency across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $70 million, up 43% and 40% on a constant currency basis primarily due to higher volume growth recurring interest margins as well as underwriting margins running favorable to expectations. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis and sales were up 20% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $206 million, up 23%, primarily driven by higher variable investment income. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $262 million compared to an adjusted loss of $258 million in the prior year quarter. Higher expenses, including interest on incremental debt, were partially offset by higher net investment income. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 23% and within our 2023 guidance of 22% to 24%. On page 6, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters including $179 million in Q3 of 2023. The private equity portfolio of $14.9 billion had a plus 1.4% return in the quarter. Real estate equity funds of $2.2 billion had a minus 3% return. As of now, we anticipate PE returns to remain consistent with the second and third quarter with a modest improvement in real estate funds in the fourth quarter. Therefore, VII would more closely resemble second quarter results. On page 7 we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior five quarters. As we have noted previously each of the businesses hold its own discrete investment portfolios, which have been built to match its liabilities. As reflected in the chart, Asia, RIS and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile while Corporate and Other continues to hold higher VII assets than historical levels. Now turning to page 8. The chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past three years and Q3 of 2022 versus Q3 of 2023. While VII has had lower than trend returns over the last few quarters, recurring income, which accounts for approximately 96% of net investment income, was up approximately $700 million year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. Shifting your attention to the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yield over the past three years, new money yields continue to outpace roll-off yields in the recent quarters. In this quarter, our global new money yield continued its upward trajectory coming in at 6.26%, 156 basis points higher than the roll-off yield. We expect this favorable trend to continue assuming interest rates remain near current levels. Turning to page 9. I'll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans. First, let me say that we are pleased with the commercial mortgage loan or CML portfolio, which continues to perform as expected. As we have noted last quarter our real estate team updated all US office valuations through June 30, assuming a 25% peak to trough valuation decline. In this quarter, the team shifted its effort to revaluing other CML asset classes, which have not been under the pressure seen in the office sector. Not surprisingly, the average LTV increased only slightly as a result with our CML portfolio now at an average LTV of 63%, up from 62% in the second quarter of 2023 and an average debt service coverage ratio of 2.3 times, which represents no change versus 2Q 2023. The modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratio are further indicators of the disciplined approach we take to investing in this asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong with only 1.6% of loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than one times. With regards to CML loan maturities, we now have successfully resolved almost 90% of the portfolio scheduled to mature in 2023 and our expectation remains for minimal losses on the portfolio. Our CML portfolio scheduled maturities over the next three years are very manageable, 10% in 2024 13% in 2025 and 16% in 2026. Now, let's switch gears to discuss expenses on page 10. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for the full year of 2022 as well as the first three quarters of 2023. In Q3 of 2023, the ratio was 12.3%. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q3 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. While we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in Q4 consistent with the seasonality of our business, we are confident we will beat our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.6% in 2023 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. Now let's turn to page 11. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past five years including an update for 2022. As mentioned by Michel, MetLife invested $3.7 billion of capital in 2022 to support new business. This was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of six years, generating roughly $2.3 billion in value. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on page 12. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.9 billion at September 30th, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion and higher than our $4.2 billion at June 30th. The cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, a $1 billion senior debt issuance in July, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchase of roughly $800 million in the third quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares holding approximately $250 million in October. For our US companies preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.1 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.6 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting partially offset by higher expenses. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.7 billion as of September 30, 2023, up 2% from June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to operating earnings partially offset by dividends paid and net investment losses. Total US statutory adjusted capital has absorbed a negative impact of roughly $300 million associated with the investments expected to be transferred to Global Atlantic, which will be recovered upon closing. Finally we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 600% as of September 30th, which we based on statutory statements that will be filed over the next few weeks. Let me conclude with a few points. First, while VII remains below historical returns, core spreads remain robust and continue to benefit from higher yield environment. Second, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals continues to be displayed with strong top line growth coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. Finally, our strong value of new business metrics provide further evidence of our disciplined approach to deploying capital to its highest and best use consistent with our all-weather strategy. To close, MetLife remains in a position of strength given our balance sheet, free cash flow generation and diversification of our market-leading businesses and we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and building sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Can you provide some color on how January 1 renewals are shaping up so far in Group Benefits and also both in terms of persistency in the pricing dynamic in the market?
Ramy Tadro: Good morning, Ryan. It's Ramy here. I would say we're still in the middle of the season. Recall the middle part of the market is still kind of active right now. But from everything we can see so far, we are doing extremely well here. Persistency in national accounts continues to be exceptionally high. We are seeing a tick up in the jumbo activity into next year as well building on what we're doing this year. And with respect to our rate actions, we are getting the rates that the book needs in the market and continue to see that both in terms of new business as well as persistency.
Ryan Krueger: Thanks. And then in terms of capabilities within in Group Benefits and M&A, you've done a couple of things to round out the portfolio. Is there anything else you'd be interested in at this point? Or do you feel like you have what you need to grow organically?
Michel Khalaf: Yeah. Hi, Ryan, it's Michel. Yeah. I mean, I think we're very pleased with the capabilities that we've built with the transactions that we've done in the last few years in Group Benefits. I think they've been highly complementary and we're very pleased in how they've performed. Think about our Pet First acquisition our Versant acquisition. And we'll continue to invest in this business. We've said all along that this is a business where scale matters, and to continue to meet customer expectations, you have to continue to make meaningful investment, something that we've done, and I think that's translating in terms of the momentum we're seeing whether it's in variable benefits or in other areas. Whereas, we don't see any gaps, when it comes to our product set or our capabilities. We're always open to opportunities, if we think those make strategic sense, if we think they can help us accelerate revenue growth, whereas we see a path to continue to grow at within the range that we provided organically, if there was something that would help us accelerate that that would make sense strategically. And that would make sense from a valuation perspective as well. We look for the type of transactions that are accretive over time that clear a minimum risk-adjusted hurdle rate. And we're always going to also compare any transaction to other potential uses of capital. At the end of the day, our focus pillar is about deploying capital to its highest and best use. So hopefully, this helps.
Ryan Krueger: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Good morning. A couple of questions on capital. The SMR in Japan seems kind of low at 600% now. Is that something to watch? Or should we really be more focused on ESR since we're going to be pivoting to that new regime pretty soon. So that's the first question. The second is just the $1 billion increase in debt. Is that part of the permanent capital structure? Or are you pre-funding a maturity there?
John McCallion: Good morning, Tom it's John. Thanks. So first question on SMR. Yes, I think it's a balance when you start to look at these metrics. Obviously, we're looking forward at ESR higher rates are positive to ESR. So I think there's a transition happening in the market. We don't have any concerns with being at of roughly 600% right now. Also we have other tools if needed to the extent that rates would rise further we have other internal reinsurance transactions we could do as of now. So no concerns from a capital perspective or dividend capacity perspective. What was your second question?
Tom Gallagher: The $1 billion debt increase.
John McCallion: On debt, yes, so we issued the debt in July. That is not considered permanent capital. That is to pre-fund a maturity in the first quarter of next year.
Tom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks. And then just one other quick one. The slightly improved real estate returns expected for alternatives in 4Q. Is that because you have some property sales resuming and related gains? Or is that just marks being stable?
John McCallion: Yes. I think it's more of the latter. I think it's just we've in a way it's trailing a little bit of what's happened in PE, where we had kind of the markdown and then we've built – you've kind of gotten to a trough. And as we’ve said before we feel like we bump along the bottom here for a little bit on some of these fund related returns for sometime. So before we see kind of that U-shaped recovery. So it's more of that.
Tom Gallagher: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Next we move on to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So first I had a question on just retirement spreads. Should we assume that core spreads in the RIS business will maybe compress a little bit as you go through 2024, given expiration of caps? Or are there other puts and takes?
John McCallion: Good morning, Jimmy, it's John. As you said so good strong core spreads this quarter similar to last quarter just to you guide to fourth. We think something in the same vicinity maybe 135 to 40 is a good range to think about for fourth quarter. And then as you mentioned over the course of 2024 we will have some expiration of some of the caps. As we said before, this whole thing was constructed in a way for the caps to provide us time for the long rates to find their way into spreads. And those things you've seen that come through in a healthy way. So we'll give some more guidance on that on the outlook call and provide some more detail as to how to think about 2024.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on the CRE portfolio, the metrics almost seem deceptively too good and stable. But you mentioned you've resolved 88% of your 2023 maturities. Are you resolving them similar to how you would have done in the past like in terms of either extending them yourself or third-party financing or stuff? Or are there differences in how the loans are being – how the maturities are being resolved now versus maybe a few years ago when things were much more stable than CRE?
John McCallion: Yes, it's John, again. Thanks. I take issue with your deceptively comments. But besides that only kidding. But on the maturities, it's roughly speaking, we've talked about these contractual extension options. That's been about 60% of the maturities and how they've all had contractual right. If you're in good standing, you meet all the financial tests. They tend to be in the mid-50s LTV. So strong financial metrics, almost 30% as well in terms of paid off or refinanced. And then the remainder is probably 10% of that is loan modifications, and then the remaining small single digits is the foreclosure or net payoff, which is honestly that level is somewhat similar to what we've seen in the past. So, nothing out of the ordinary given the environment. So I think overall, roughly in line with historical, maybe the people on the contractual options those are floating rate. They're tending to wait to see when they lock in their long-term rates. So, maybe there's been a little extra, in terms of contractual extension options, but nothing out of the ordinary. I think is the way to think about it.
Jimmy Bhullar: And the remaining 12% that's just like a matter of time and you're going through stuff? Or is there something unique about those properties, either by property location or otherwise?
John McCallion: Yes. And the -- the levels I gave you just now, they incorporate what we expect for the remaining 12%. So nothing unique or out of the ordinary. So I think -- I think the punchline, we would share is everything is effectively in line, with what we said in the first quarter when we gave an outline of what our expectation was for the year.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you. 
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. Just first question on the value of new business side. So the amount of capital, you've been deploying has sort of been the $3.7 billion. It's pretty similar to what you did in 2018 and 2019. But given where interest rates are, are you seeing incremental opportunities to deploy more capital in the business? And then relatedly, should we expect that IRR of 17% which I acknowledge is pretty healthy, does that have upside in this rate environment?
John McCallion: Good morning. Sumeet. It's John. Good question. So just in terms of deployment of capital remember last year, I mean just one reason for that I,s we had IBM case that came through in the third quarter of last year. But nonetheless, like you pointed out, very strong unlevered IRRs strong payback periods. Very pleased with the results. We saw some great results actually in Japan as well. That's actually helping boost the VNB as well over the course of 2022. In terms of IRRs, some of the things we've talked about is we do see I think broadly speaking yes I mean we're starting to see demand for these annuity-type products to pick up, right? So I think a volume aspect is emerging. I'd say, it's still emerging in the institutional and retail space broadly speaking. In terms of IRR and pricing, typically the rate environment will price in. These -- the counterparties were buying or selling however you want to look at it, they're pricing in the current rate environment. So I wouldn't expect a big uptick in IRRs. I think 17% IRR is a pretty healthy level to be at. But we'll see how things evolve.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then just on capital should we expect a pickup in the sort of the pace of buyback once you close the Global Atlantic deal?
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Hi, Suneet. It's Michel. So really pleased, with the fact that we've secured all regulatory approvals for the Global Atlantic transaction. As we had mentioned, we expect that to add about 60 points to our RBC and we consider that to be excess capital. When we announced the transaction we increased the authorization by $1 billion and that was to signal the sustainability of our buyback activity. We also have a track record post major divestitures of returning capital and a deliberate and expeditious manner. So I would suggest that we would conduct ourselves in the same manner here.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Wes Carmichael with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Wes Carmichael: Hey, Good morning. A follow-up on the Group business. It seems like we're seeing pretty favorable results across the industry maybe not deceptively good but definitely good. But just wondering what your outlook is for the industry to retain better margins in that business or if it's kind of given back over pricing in the next couple of years?
Ramy Tadros: Good morning, Wes. It's Ramy here. I mean, look, I think a couple of points to note here. So one we're of course extremely pleased with our record quarter here which is by the way a record even, if you exclude the notable in the quarter. In general, what we tend to see in our results is there's seasonality. And while the dynamics are different by product line in aggregate the third quarter tends to be the most favorable over the course of the year. If I think for us specifically on a go-forward basis, you should think about the mortality ratio which is below the guidance for this quarter. Think about that coming back in the fourth quarter to be within line for our guidance range. The other one, I would perhaps talk about here is disability. I mean, disability continues to perform really well both with respect to incidents and recovery levels. Some of this favorability is stemming from a favorable macro environment. And we believe that, favorability will over time. It's not going to happen in any given quarter but will over time come back into pricing. But having said that, and I'll refer back to kind of Michel's comments on having real focus and strategic intent here in terms of how we're investing in this business. The favorability we're seeing in disability is coming from solid underwriting return to health capabilities deployment of data technology, predictive analytics in how we're running this business in particular investments we're also making in the live and absent space. Those are resonating really well in the market. And we believe over time, will allow us to fuel further growth and maintain very robust margins here. And those are not going away. Those are differentiating capabilities that we have and distinct competitive advantages that we will maintain and continue to invest in.
Wes Carmichael: Thanks, Ramy. And maybe sticking with the US on the pension risk transfer market, it seems like maybe the market for full plan terminations has been heating up a little bit. I'm just wondering, if you're willing to participate in those deals and also what the pipeline looks like as the fourth quarter has been pretty busy historically.
Ramy Tadros: Thanks. So we're pretty pleased with our performance this quarter. So year-to-date we've had $3.5 billion worth of sales. We've also added another $600 million of premium so far in the fourth quarter. And we see a very healthy pipeline ahead and really with a lot of visibility into 2024. And in particular in the jumbo end of the market which is where we focus and where we have distinct competitive advantages. Our focus so far has been on the immediate with RV only part of the market and we see significant pipeline there and we're able to win business at healthy IRRs. But we always continuously evaluate opportunities here. And as we've always stated it's value over volume here. And so if we see opportunities with the right IRRs and the right returns and the right risk profile we're always going to be looking to evaluate those as we go forward.
Wes Carmichael: Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott: First one I had for you on is LatAm. We continue to see good growth there. I think in the comments you mentioned some of the digital initiatives and things like that. But I wanted to see if you could extrapolate further just on the sustainability of the really robust growth that you've seen in PFOs and how we should think about that business going into?
Eric Clurfain: Yes. H, Alex. Thanks for the question. This is Eric. So we're overall very pleased with our results for the quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of adjusted earnings in the $200 million range. The quarter's results are primarily driven by volume growth, favorable underwriting as well as foreign currency tailwinds which were partially offset by lower recurring interest margins. And on the top-line side, the positive trajectory continues as you mentioned with solid double-digit growth consistent with our expectations. We're seeing growth across the region in both our retail and group business. We've been very deliberate in expanding beyond our core avenues of growth developing third-party distribution channels such as banks financial institutions retailers and others. And we've made significant technology-related investments in that space. And a good example is what you referred to that Michel mentioned and is opening around the launch of our new integrated platform, which provides embedded insurance capabilities for our distribution partners and thus creating a differentiating competitive advantage for us across the region. So all these factors combined with our disciplined underwriting pricing as well as efficiency focus are contributing to the solid earnings performance and sustained momentum.
Alex Scott: Very helpful. And then second question was on net investment income. Wanted to see if you could help us just with the benefits of higher interest rates and what it means really for net investment income trajectory more broadly across the organization. And then also interested if there's any tactical things you can do anything you're doing allocation-wise that we should consider related to net investment income?
John McCallion: Good morning, Alex. It's John. So a couple of things to point to for your question. We've given some sensitivities to interest rate movements in the past. And I think those are still fair approach to thinking about the impact generally driven by the benefits of roll-off and reinvest and you're seeing that on the slides we shared. So that has an incremental benefit. Obviously, we've also done a lot to reduce our interest rate sensitivity over the years. So it's not a hockey stick per se but there's inertia there as you look at some of those sensitivities. So I don't know if I have a number to give, because gross numbers maybe get lost, but those sensitivities are more from an earnings perspective and those are probably pretty good things to follow and think through as you kind of model out earnings growth. In terms of tactical. I think, there's always tactical asset allocations that occur. We have a view of relative values that we take into account. But certainly as rates grow fixed-oriented products going to grow in relative value. And we're seeing some unique opportunities out there. It's very helpful to have a wide breadth of product and expertise to work through the opportunities that are in the space and that's scale. That scale is a big benefit. So we're excited for the opportunities that are out there. And having done that we've been maintaining an up in quality mentality when it comes to investments. And with these rates it's worked pretty well.
Alex Scott: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
John Barnidge : Good morning. Thank you. Question about the value of new business slide that's updated not around IRRs, but can you talk about how higher rates in your outlook for that volume to possibly increase along with the value of new business? Thank you.
John McCallion : Hey, John, it's John. Thanks for the question. I think there's a couple of ways to think through that as I mentioned in the earlier comment, I mean, we are seeing an increase in demand. And that is -- we've been able to solve that fairly efficiently with just annual capital generation. And that -- but we do think that it is going to grow and we are constantly considering different ways to take advantage of that. I think eventually as -- and maybe a little bit to an earlier question as volume and demand grows that could improve pricing to some degree. Right now I think it's fairly consistent and adjust with interest rates. But there is dynamics between volume and how that can also improve value but that will take some time.
John Barnidge : Thank you very much. And my follow-up question. I know we're in the thick of renewal season for group benefits, but some retailers have started to comment about the impact from GLP or obesity treatment. How do you -- is that something that's come up within the renewal conversation at all? Just wanted to ask that. Thank you.
Ramy Tadros : Yes. We're not really -- it's Ramy, here John. We're not really seeing any of those having any kind of material effect on our book of business. And remember, we're not in the major medical we're not providing Rx. We are group life players and none of that is really having any material impact at this point.
John Barnidge : Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Mike Ward with Citi. Please go ahead.
Mike Ward : Thanks guys. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could comment on the trends in Asia. It seems like the economy in Japan at least is reengaging or reopening. So any thoughts on maybe the near-term outlook there?
Lyndon Oliver : Hey, Mike it's Lyndon here. So just as we look at broadly Asia, I'll just comment on sales and then maybe we can getting Japan more specifically. Overall, we've had a very strong quarter and year-over-year sales continue to be very strong. We've seen a 5% growth overall and in Japan 3%. In Asia, in total we've been up 8% and that's driven broadly between Korea and China. If we look at the economy in Japan, it is really strong but our sales are primarily driven by interest rates. And so the stronger interest rates have really helped us. So as long as that continues, we think we've got a really solid platform on which to leverage the higher sales.
Mike Ward: Thanks. And then, maybe just could you guys maybe speak to your appetite, specifically for inorganic growth in the US around voluntary benefits that would be helpful. Thanks.
Michel Khalaf: Hi Mike. It's Michel. So, as I mentioned earlier, whereas we don't see any gaps when it comes to our Group Benefits business here. We've been growing voluntary at -- in the high-teens for a number of years. The employee paid component of our sales is also growing. We're always open to do something inorganically, if we feel that it fits strategically, if it adds the capability, if it helps us accelerate revenue growth, provided it is accretive over time and provided it also compares favorably to other potential uses of capital. So whereas there are no gaps, we have M&A as a strategic capability here and we'll deploy it as we believe it makes sense to do so. And if it's a better use of capital compared to other potential uses.
Mike Ward: Thanks Michel. Maybe just one follow-up on that. Is capesize something that makes you consider or not consider M&A in group overall?
Michel Khalaf: Meaning, Mike, you're referring to sort of deal size?
Mike Ward: No, sorry, like the target market employer size?
Michel Khalaf: I mean not really. I mean I would say, we have scale across our businesses and across markets. It's more around does one plus one equal more than two, if you like in terms of what we have and what we are potentially acquiring.
Mike Ward: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we will turn the conference back to John Hall.
John Hall: Great. Thank you everybody for joining us on this very busy morning for insurance earnings and have a nice day. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-03 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you operator. Good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's second quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of MetLife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter. The slides are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to the slides features disclosures, GAAP reconciliations, and other information, which you should similarly review. As usual, after prepared remarks, we will host the Q&A session, which will end promptly just prior to the top of the hour. In fairness to everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michelle.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As market conditions continue to fluctuate, what has been a constant is the underlying performance of MetLife's diversified set of market-leading businesses. What has also been constant is the relentless execution of our strategy, which includes delivering in the second quarter on our commitment to accelerate the runoff of our legacy business through a financially attractive deal that also reduces enterprise risk. Our strong risk management capabilities are the bedrock of MetLife. This foundation enables us to successfully navigate shifting currents. We are confident in the prudence of our investment portfolio. We are secure in the effectiveness of our asset liability matching. We are certain of the safety and soundness of our capital and liquidity, and we are convinced of our balance sheet's strength. Shifting to second quarter results, last night we reported adjusted earnings of $1.5 billion, or $1.94 per share, which compares to $1.7 billion, or $2.13 per share a year ago. We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum of our core businesses, which was evident in the quarter. Our sales were strong across the board with impressive results in group, retirement and income solutions, Asia and Latin America. Our underwriting results were well within targeted levels. Our direct expense ratio totaled 12.2%, illustrating our capacity to generate further operating leverage. Our recurring investment income continues to climb with new money rates pushing past 6%, and our adjusted return on equity of 14.6%, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, met our target range of 13% to 15%. For the quarter, variable investment income of $221 million came in below our outlook expectation. In the aggregate, private equity returns were about 1.5%, inclusive of a positive 40 basis point return on our venture capital portfolio. We generated a minus 1.9% return on real estate equity funds, an asset class that remains under some cyclical pressure. Nonetheless, we believe we've reached the trough relative to VIIs contribution to our quarterly adjusted earnings. In total, net income for the second quarter was $370 million, which reflects certain required accounting adjustments following the announcement of our pending re-insurance transaction with Global Atlantic. We did not incur material credit losses in our real estate portfolio or elsewhere during the second quarter.  Shifting to MetLife's business performance in the quarter, I will start with our US group benefits results. Adjusted earnings totaled $372 million with underwriting results in line with our expectations after reflecting certain unfavorable items. In total, year-to-date sales are up 13% while year-to-date adjusted PFOs are up 5%, reflecting the impact of par firmly within our 4% to 6% outlook range, which we expect to achieve for the full year 2023. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to sustain our growth trajectory in this attractive capital-light business for many reasons. The strength of our relationships with our largest national accounts, where our average customer has been with us for more than 20 years, is well-known. The power behind this strength is apparent when you consider that 75% of new sales are made to existing customers through product additions and enrollment growth. Our efforts to accelerate growth in regional business is evident in our market share gains. A key element of this success is driven by our expansive product portfolio, the broadest across the benefits universe. As a proof point, more than half of our new regional business customers purchase multiple products. And again, this can also be seen in our success with voluntary products, which we've been able to grow at a mid-to-high-teens rate for many years now. For retirement and income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $417 million, up 11% from the prior year, driven by higher recurring investment margins and higher asset balances. Sales in the quarter were very strong across a range of products, including pension risk transfer with more than $2 billion booked, structured settlements, longevity reinsurance, and post-retirement benefits. We see good run rates for growth in all these areas. In Asia, adjusted earnings of $431 million were below a year ago on lower variable investment income. Our ability to bring new products quickly to market was on full display in the quarter. Sales on a constant currency basis were up 34% in the region, led by Japan, where sales jumped 42% year-over-year, led by the introduction of a foreign currency life insurance product. Turning to Latin America, which put up another strong quarter, adjusted earnings totaled $219 million. Further, Latin America posted gains in both sales and adjusted PFOs of 13% and 14% respectively on a constant currency basis. Taking a wider lens on the momentum in our business, we managed through the pandemic expecting to emerge from the turmoil stronger than we entered. With the fullness of time, we can now see that is true. Some numbers can help. In full year 2019, our group benefits business generated premiums, fees, and other revenues of roughly $19 billion. We are on track to generate group benefits PFOs of roughly $24 billion in 2023, representing $5 billion of growth at a CAGR of more than 5%. In 2019, our retirement income solutions business generated average quarterly adjusted earnings of $310 million, with variable investment income matching outlook expectations. So far in 2023, RIS has averaged about $410 million of adjusted earnings per quarter, without the benefit of normal VII. Similarly, our Latin America business averaged roughly $150 million of adjusted earnings per quarter in 2019, which has grown to an average of more than $200 million per quarter in 2023. To me, the message is clear. The fundamentals associated with our market leading businesses continue to gather steam. Moving to capital and cash, MetLife remained active with capital management during the second quarter. Following the increase to our common stock dividend, we paid roughly $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders, and we repurchased $672 million of our common stock. The pace of repurchases in the second quarter slowed due to the impending announcement of our reinsurance deal. In addition to our activity in the second quarter, we repurchased roughly another $300 million of our common stock during the month of July. Here today through July, we have repurchased about $1.8 billion of our common shares, which leaves approximately $3.5 billion remaining on our expanded repurchase authorization. As we have done consistently over time, we carefully assess every use of capital with the goal of achieving the right balance between investing in responsible growth for the future and returning capital to generate sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. At the end of the quarter, we held $4.2 billion of cash at our holding companies, which is above the top end of the $3 billion to $4 billion liquidity buffer we maintained. In the beginning of July, we issued $1 billion of senior debt on attractive terms, which will be included in our cash balance in the third quarter. Beyond this, the dynamics of our reinsurance transaction will further add to cash as we move through the remainder of this year. During the quarter, we announced that Steve Goulart will retire at the end of August. Today will be his last earnings call with us. So feel free to pepper him with questions. You will not get another chance. I would like to take this moment to thank Steve for his 17 years of distinguished service to MetLife. In that time span, he led our corporate development and mergers and acquisitions team and served as treasurer before taking on his roles as MetLife's chief investment officer and the president of MetLife Investment Management. From a standing start in 2012, Steve established MetLife Investment Management and fostered its growth to its present status as a $167 billion institutional fixed income and real estate manager. I believe the talent at MetLife truly sets us apart and serves as a clear differentiator for our company. Steve's retirement provides the opportunity to broaden the roles and responsibilities of some of our top leaders. In addition to her role as chief risk officer, Marlene Debel will lead MetLife Insurance Investments with chief investment officer Chuck Scully reporting directly to Marlene. John McCallion, MetLife's chief financial officer will take on additional responsibility as the head of MetLife Investment Management. And Ramy Tadros, regional president to us business, will add head of MetLife Holdings to his portfolio. These moves draw upon MetLife's deep bench and illustrate our ability to deploy top talent to the areas of greatest impact for our customers and shareholders. In closing, MetLife's all weather strategy positions us to perform across a range of economic cycles. By focusing on what we can control, how we execute, how we invest, and how we deploy capital, we will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance in greater detail.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michelle, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '23 supplemental slides which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital positions. In addition, I'll provide an update on our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Starting on Page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net investment losses were primarily the result of securities that were associated with the pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic that we announced at the end of May. For GAAP purposes, gross unrealized losses as of June 30 on securities expected to be transferred to Global Atlantic at closing are required to be realized through net income this quarter. In addition, we had net derivative losses due to the favorable equity markets, strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Yen, and higher interest rates. That said, derivative losses were mostly offset this quarter by market risk benefit, or MRB remeasurement gains, due to higher equity markets and interest rates. Overall, the portfolio remains well positioned, credit losses continue to be modest, and the hedging program performed as expected. On Page four, you can see the second quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding a favorable notable item of $77 million in 2Q of '22, primarily related to a reinsurance settlement, which was accounted for in MetLife Holdings. There were no notable items in the current quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion down 10%, and down 11% on a constant currency basis. The primary driver was lower variable investment income. Underwriting margins were also less favorable than the prior year, but within our targeted ranges. Higher recurring interest margins and solid volume growth were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.94 down 5% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses starting with the U.S., group benefits adjusted earnings were $372 million, down 8% versus the prior year period. Results were below run rate expectations for the quarter due to certain unfavorable expense, reinsurance, and reserve related items, which reduced group benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $40 million, and were specific to this quarter. The group-life mortality ratio was 85.3%, essentially in line with the prior year quarter, and at the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 73.7% in the quarter, above the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. We had a disability reserve refinement of approximately $15 million after tax, which increased the ratio by 0.8 percentage points, and was included in the items totaling $40 million that I just referenced. Turning to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 4% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 1%, the underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year, primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum and voluntary, and was within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition, group benefit sales were up 13% year-to-date, driven by strong growth across most products end markets. Retirement and income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $417 million, up 11% year-over-year. The primary drivers were higher recurring interest margins and solid volume growth. This was partially offset by lower variable investment income year-over-year. RIS investment spreads were 132 basis points. Spreads excluding VII were 142 basis points, up 29 basis points versus Q2 of '22, primarily due to higher interest rates, as well as income from in the money interest rate caps. RIS liability exposures were up 5% year-over-year, driven by general account liabilities, which grew 7% due to strong net flows. RIS adjusted PFOs excluding pension risk transfers were up 73%, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products and growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we completed two transactions worth approximately $2 billion in the quarter, and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were $431 million, down 11% and 9% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income. Adjusted earnings ran approximately $25 million above expectation due to certain reserve refinements and tax related true ups. Asia's key growth metrics were strong as general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 5% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 34% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth across the region. In Japan, sales were up 42% year-over-year, driven by continued strong momentum in FX annuities through our face-to-face channels, as well as life sales due to a relaunch of a single premium FX life product on April 1. We continue to see Japanese consumer interest for FX products given the attractive higher U.S. interest rates. Latin America adjusted earnings were $219 million, down 13% and 21% on a constant currency basis, due to less favorable underwriting margin versus 2Q of '22. The prior year quarter had a roughly $40 million benefit to adjusted earnings from a release of a COVID related IB&R reserve. In addition, investment margins were down year-over-year, partially offset by solid volume growth. Latin America's top line continues to perform well, as adjusted PFOs were up 23% and 14% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $70 million, up 6% and up 15% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by higher recurring interest margins. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 4% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife holdings adjusted earnings were $211 million, down 31%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $228 million, essentially flat versus an adjusted loss of $227 million in the prior year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 22%, and at the low end of our 2023 guidance of 22% to 24%. On Page five, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters, including $221 million in Q2 of ‘23. Private equity portfolio, $14.6 billion, had a plus 1.5% return in the quarter. Real estate equity funds of $2.2 billion had a minus 1.9% return, while both PE and real estate equity funds are reported on a one quarter lag. As of now, we anticipate that VII in the third quarter will generally be in line with the second quarter result. On Page six, we provide VII post tax by segment for the prior five quarters. As you've noted previously, each of the businesses holds its own discrete investment portfolios, which have been built to match its liabilities. As reflected in the chart, Asia, RAS, and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest portion of VII assets given their long dated liability profile. For 2Q of ‘23, Asia's VII portfolio generated the highest returns at 2.2%, outperforming MetLife Holdings at 1.5% and RAS at 0.9%. Now turning to Page seven, the chart on the left of the Page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past three years in Q2 of ‘22 versus Q2 of ‘23. While VII has had the lower than trend returns over the last few quarters, recurring income, which accounts for approximately 96% of net investment income, was up $700 million year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. Shifting your attention to the chart on the right of the Page, which shows our new money yield versus roll off yield over the past three years, new money yields continue to outpace roll off yields in the recent quarters. In this quarter, our global new money yield reached its highest level in more than a decade of 6.06%, 157 basis points higher than the roll off yield. We expect this favorable trend to continue assuming interest rates remain near current levels. Turning to Page eight, I'll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans, which you can find further details in our quarterly financial supplement. As of June 30, our commercial mortgage loan, or CML portfolio, carrying value of approximately $53 billion is well diversified by geography and property type. The CML portfolio is concentrated in high quality properties and in larger primary markets. These loans are typically to the larger and stronger institutional sponsors who are better positioned to effectively manage assets through periods of stress. Given the focus on the office sector, our real estate team updated all U.S. office valuation through June 30, assuming a 25% peak to trough valuation decline. We believe it was prudent to focus our efforts here in the quarter given the heightened attention this has received. As expected, LTVs increased slightly as a result with our CML portfolio now in an average LTV of 62%, up from 58% in the first quarter of ‘23, and an average debt service coverage ratio of 2.3 times down slightly from 2.4 times in 1Q ‘23. The modest increase in LTVs coupled with the resiliency and robustness of the debt service coverage ratio is another indicator of the disciplined approach we take to investing in this asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong with only 2% of the loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than one times. With regards to CML loan maturities, we now have successfully resolved 69% of the portfolio's schedule to mature in 2023, and our expectation is for minimal losses on the portfolio. Now let's switch gears to discuss expenses on Page 9.  This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for full year 2022, as well as Q1 of '23 and Q2 of '23, which had a ratio of 12.2%. As you have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q2 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top-line growth and ongoing expense discipline. We remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio of 12.6% or below in 2023, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at June 30, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 to $4 billion and consistent with March 31. The cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, and share repurchases of roughly $700 million in the second quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. The buybacks in Q2 of '23 were lower than our recent trend as we were in a blackout period for most of May in advance of our pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. That said, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $300 million in July. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter, year-to-date 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2 billion, while net income was approximately $1.3 billion, statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.3 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.4 billion as of June 30, 2023, down 2% from March 31, 2023, primarily due to the temporary impact of roughly $300 million associated with the investments expected to be transferred to Global Atlantic. We expect these impacts to reverse at close, which remains on target by year-end. In addition, as previously disclosed, we expect the transaction to add approximately 60 combined RBC points. Finally, we expect the Japan-Solvency Margin Ratio to be approximately 700% as of June 30, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Let me conclude with a few points. First, while VII remains below historical returns, we believe we reached a trough. In addition, core spreads remain robust and continue to benefit from a higher yielding environment. Second, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals continues to be displayed with strong top-line growth coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. Lastly, MetLife remains in a position of strength, given our balance sheet, investment portfolio, free cash flow generation, and the diversification of our market-leading businesses. And we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and building sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we first go to the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question was, following the recent risk transfer deal, do you see further opportunities for additional risk transfer in MetLife holdings over time? 
John McCallion: Good morning, Ryan. It's John. I think we would probably follow the same commentary we've given before. We are continuing to look for ways to optimize. We look internally for ways to optimize, and we continue to have external communications around different opportunities. I think at the end of the day, similar to what we did with this transaction, it needs to fit the right profile for us. It needs to be value-creative. It needs to be risk-reducing. And by the end of the day, we don't have to. We're very comfortable managing these blocks of businesses ourselves. We have the expertise. And I think there are different ways to find ways to optimize that book. But nonetheless, it's a healthy process for us continuing to have these conversations.
Ryan Krueger: Thanks. And then I had to ask one for Steve on his last call. Could you provide some additional details on the office loans that have been resolved year-to-date, the mix of paydowns versus extensions and any more color on what the terms of the extensions are? 
Steven Goulart: Hey, Ryan, thanks for the question. I would hate to go through my last earnings call without a question. But on your question, let me talk about the total portfolio. Again, John mentioned 69% of the loans scheduled to mature this year have already been resolved. Of that, 31% of them were actually paid off. So very positive. And 57% of them were resolved through the borrower extension of contractual loan extensions. And we've talked about that a little bit in the past. But again, those are not financially distressed loans. I mean, the average LTV on those loans is 51%. And again, they have contractual extensions that allow the borrower to choose to extend. And that's what has happened with those. And again, when they do, they have to meet financial performance tests related to debt yield, related to LTV, sometimes both. We also get fees paid on those extensions. And so it's not a surprise, it's given where interest rates are, that this is what the borrowers would choose to do. The office portfolio is very similar in those statistics that I just gave. So we're very comfortable looking out the rest of the year. We would expect similar resolutions and are very pleased with how it's moving forward.
Ryan Krueger: Okay, great. Thank you Steve.
Operator: And our next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, John, I think you pointed out that there was around 40 million of one-off items within groups. So just thinking about going forward, should we just normalize for that and think about that as the run-rate earnings power of the segment? Or is there any other seasonality that we should take in mind in the back half of the year? 
Ramy Tadros: Hi, Elyse. It's Ramy. So the short answer to your question is yes. So these were unfavorable items that we don't expect to reoccur. Just to give you a flavor of what the items were. So the first one is an expense item which is related to a catch-up on state tax assessment. The second one is an adjustment on the life-free insurance policy. And the third one is a reserve refinement in our disability line which as John indicated impacted our non-medical health ratio by just about a point. So we don't expect these to be recurring as I mentioned. And so, you could essentially normalize for those on a go-forward basis.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question, you guys saw buyback pick up in July. So is that July level kind of a good run rate from here? As we think about the holding transaction closing and then I also believe, your subsidiary dividends are typically, greater in the back half of the year?
Michel Khalaf: Hi. Good morning, Elyse. Michelle here. So I would say that there was a bit of catch-up in July given the fact that we were in blackout for, part of the second quarter due to the re-insurance transaction. So, if you look at probably the sort of run rate up to July here to date, I think that gives you a good sense of sort of pacing. We obviously we're looking to close the transaction in the second half of the year. And one we do, we'll assess the environment at the time. I think we've built a good track record here in terms of, after major divestitures in terms of how we we're deliberate and expeditious and returning access capital and, expect the same here.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks, Michelle.
Operator: And next we go to Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Hi, thank you. Can you provide some more color on your non-medical health underwriting results this quarter, in particular, the experience in dental and disability and how you're thinking about those going forward?
Ramy Tadros: Sure, Erik. It's Ramy here. So, I'll start with disability. So, all results this quarter were favorable year-over-year. We're seeing favorable incidents and very strong recovery levels and I'm very pleased with the performance of that line this quarter. And as I just noted before, we have seen about a one-point impact on the ratio given some of those reserve refinements which we referred to earlier. On disability, we're continuing to benefit from tailwinds here in terms of favorable macroenvironment and interest rates and tight labor markets. But aside from the macro factors, we're also benefiting from our strong underwriting, our return to health capabilities, the deployment of data and technology and how we run this business. And we also continue to invest in our leave and absence capabilities which give us pricing power and continue to resonate well in the marketplace. From a dental perspective, we have seen a slight elevation, our trend this quarter, driven by an increase in our claims costs. As part of the normal course of managing this product, we adjust our pricing to make sure we meet our target margins. So as a reminder, we reprice the majority of our dental book, call it about 80% annually and we're always monitoring the trend and adjusting our pricing accordingly. So this is part of the course in terms of managing a dental book. And maybe if you want to kind of step back and look at the non-medical health benefit ratio for the full year which is inclusive of dental and disability, we expect to be at the midpoint of our guidance range for the full year here.
Erik Bass: Thank you. And then if it could pivot to Asia, Japan sales continue to be very strong. So we could talk a little bit more about what's driving this, the current competitive dynamics in the market and what impact a change in BOJ policy could have on the business.
Lyndon Oliver: Hey, yes, thanks Erik. It's Lyndon here. So look, we're very pleased with the overall sales performance we've seen in Asia in the second quarter. You've seen Asia's sales overall have grown 34%. And Japan in particular is up 42% and the rest of Asia up 17%. Now if we look a little deeper in Japan, foreign currency products continue to drive our sales growth over there. The market for single premium foreign currency products has been strong given the higher rate environment. And we continue to sustain our market position in the annuity segment. Michele pointed out in his opening remarks, our ability to bring new products to market quickly has really helped us in terms of launching our single premium foreign currency product. We've also optimized our capital structure for these products by leveraging our internal reinsurance in Bermuda. So the combination of both the product differentiation, the speed to market, as well as the strength of our distribution in the face to face as well as bank assurance has really been a strong factor in growing sales. If we look the rest of Asia, we've recovered really well this year. We've seen broad based improvement in China, India and Korea. And overall, all the initiatives we've taken on the customer side, the distribution side, as well as on the product, the new product launches have really helped in these markets. And if we look ahead to the outlook, our management actions have really continued to drive the sales momentum. But when we look at the year over year comparison for the second half, we're going to be challenged given we had a strong second half of the year last year. However, we're on track to be at the high end of the full year guidance of mid to high single digits.
Erik Bass: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we move to a question from Jamminder Bhullar with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Jamminder Bhullar: Good morning. So first, just a question on threads in the retirement business. Assuming that interest rates sort of followed the forward yield curve, it would be reasonable that your yield would pick up, but should we assume that spreads would improve as well? Or are you at a point where now any incremental increases in yield in the retirement business would need to be passed through to customers through higher productivity?
John McCallion: Hey, Jimmy, it's John. Good morning. Look, as we think about yield, as you said, we had a really strong quarter and certainly an RIS. We were 132 all in. And if you exclude VI, we're a healthy 142. And probably if you kind of normalize for VII, that puts us at the high end of the range, it's very much in line with what we gave at our outlook. We thought the first half of the year, even though the Ford curves have moved around and things like that, that we would have kind of a higher level in Q1 and Q2. I think as you look forward, we would think spreads kind of hover around this point. I'm not so sure it would kind of -- now, why it does that is not necessarily exactly, I'd say, perfectly aligned with the pass-through comment you made. I think there's a variety of other factors. I think it's just as the curve begins to shift, how the impact of the caps versus the long end start to manifest itself in spreads. But I think right now we would view the kind of the third quarter outlook would be somewhere in this vicinity or maybe the average of Q1 and Q2.
Michel Khalaf: And my comment was around this competition as well because there's a limit, obviously, to how much they can reasonably improve.
Jamminder Bhullar: Yes, what I meant was if the rates keep going up, you're already at a pretty good point in terms of spread. So I'm assuming it's unreasonable to assume that they keep improving a lot more from here.
John McCallion: Yes, that's fair. I think the key for us is, I'd say to your point, new business pricing is, that's where I think your point lies. I think, we still are on an overall basis have some -- we're short. So I think as there's roll-off reinvest, that's where my point was.
Jamminder Bhullar: Okay. And then in Japan, you've been selling a lot of 4x products some of your peers have as well. And I think with changes in the economic solvency margin, that product becomes more sort of capital unfriendly or not as friendly as it is right now. So I'm wondering if you are planning on making any changes to your products or you could actually manage around that through offshore reinsurance. And then relatedly, I don't know if there's a limit to how much the FSA would let companies use in terms of or use offshore reinsurance to shift business out of Japan.
Lyndon Oliver: Yes, look, hey, it's Lyndon here. Let me make a couple of comments around this. So the ESR implementation is a couple of years away. And we continue to make very good progress looking at all these products under the new regime. But we're still early in the work and the regulations are still evolving. The second point here is we currently price our products on the MetLife's economic solvency and on a local statutory basis. So to some extent, we're already using an economic lens as we analyze product profitability. But as I said, it's a little early regulations continue to go to evolve. We're in the middle of field testing. So I think as our implementation plan progresses, we will start to make adjustments as needed. This would include reinsurance or product modifications or anything like that. But it would still be too early given it's a couple of years away.
Jamminder Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Thomas Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Thomas Gallagher: Good morning. First one is just on a trend, peers have seen which has been elevated long-term care claims. It looked to me like holdings, underwriting and underlying earnings were actually pretty favorable. So I wanted to see if you also experienced elevated long-term care claims within that and if so, how much?
John McCallion: Thanks. Good morning, Tom. It's John. We did see some unfavorability kind of towards the end of Q1 and into Q2 and maybe the first couple months of Q2 higher claims as well as some lower terminations on just on a relative trend perspective. Towards the end of Q1 or Q2, I should say, and then into July, we've seen those trends revert back. So right now, we probably would account for that as an aberration, a short-term aberration, but we'll obviously still monitor I think just an overall point around results for holding. While that's the case, we had favorable mortality in the segment. So that was a positive, but specifically the long-term care. That's the case. I think on the flip side, the team has been doing a really, really good job continuing to get rate increases. We've already met our typical run rate of rate increases this year at 4.5% of premium year-to-date. That's what we typically assume each year. So we're off to a great start there.
Thomas Gallagher: Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up is, so last quarter, I think you all had mentioned 200 million of potential foreclosures on CRE or CMLs with 15 million of related losses, as I guess that was a stress test. What would the update be now? It sounds like it's probably going to be less than that, but curious what you think now. And then also, have you seen any meaningful credit migration into 2Q on your CNBS portfolio? Thanks.
Steven Goulart: Hey, Tom. It's Steven Goulart. Thanks for the question. And I think you were headed in the right direction basically. Obviously, we continue to do stress testing, but really nothing to note on that. We're very comfortable with the portfolio, very comfortable with the results of the stress testing. Certainly nothing's different. Anything may be marginally better than last time. You talked about foreclosures also. We did use a number. Frankly, it's going to come in materially less than that. We think we're going to have very small charge-offs in the portfolio as well. The portfolio is very well positioned. So I think we're very comfortable with it. And it will continue to perform through this. I'm sorry. The last part of the question was related to CNBS migration. Can you repeat the last question?
Thomas Gallagher: Sure. Steve, CNBS, did you see credit migration on that portfolio, downgrades, or did you have losses on that portfolio that you took this quarter? 
Steven Goulart: No. We haven't had any material losses in that portfolio.
Michel Khalaf: I'll just add two things, Tom. So I think to Steve's point around just losses, I think his reference to just materially less was relative to the stress that we had put out. The comments I made in the first quarter around what our expectations for kind of the maturities and kind of the potential loss there, I'd say no change is one. And then two, just maybe broadly speaking around just credit losses were very modest this quarter, as we said. And actually, I don't know if we even had any in real estate and CECL went down because there was a revaluation of a hotel that actually went up. So there's a lot of factors there. But I think all in all, the portfolio is performing well.
Thomas Gallagher: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Suneet Kamath from Jeffries. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. Just start out the best of luck to Steve. Just on the 69% of CML maturities that were, I guess, resolved here. I don't know if you mentioned this, but what percentage of those were office, if you can disclose that?
John McCallion: Yes. Let's see. The resolution was basically in line with the overall portfolio. And of the office loans, roughly the same percentage were resolved. Trying to get the actual percentage of the office. I'll get that in one second for you. 
Suneet Kamath: Okay. I can give it to my second question and then maybe circle back. I guess, for Ramy, we've seen good disability results sort of across the board, I guess, for a couple quarters now. Just curious, based on your experience, when do you think that some of these results might start to feather into pricing and we could start to see greater competition? I would imagine at some point, it would need to work its way through. Just wondering any thoughts on the timing of that. Thanks.
Ramy Tadros: Sure. I mean, I think if you're thinking about this over kind of the short to medium term, and I would say that like four factors, driving disability margins, you've got very disciplined underwriting, you've got strong claim management, you've got customer service that drives persistency and the ability to get appropriate rates at renewal. And this one is particularly important if you're in the business of providing bundled solutions, including absence and leave capabilities, which we are a market leader in. And then, of course, you got the macro factors in terms of the employment levels as well as the competitive environment. I would say for us, the first three drivers of this underwriting claims and capabilities are a core competitive advantage and will continue to be so as we continue to invest in this business. If you think about the macro environment, we're seeing some of those tailwinds right now, but we continue to be disciplined in our pricing because there's a fair bit of uncertainty in the environment going forward. And we're certainly continuing to bake that into our pricing as we look into '24.
Suneet Kamath: So pretty rational environment in terms of pricing, not just you guys, but just in terms of what you're seeing from a competitive perspective?
Ramy Tadros: Yes, I would say it's competitive. It's rational. And there's also multiple levers to differentiate beyond price. And we're certainly pulling on every single one of those levers given our scale and capabilities in this business.
Steven Goulart: Hey, Suneet, this is Steve too. And I just wanted to follow up. We did, sorry, I didn't have that answer at the tip of my fingers. But basically, it's just over five billion of total resolutions. And of that, nearly half were office.
Suneet Kamath: Got it. Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from Michael Ward with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe just on VII or [also] overall, pretty solid result, I think, considering the macro and real estate dynamic. Just wondering if you can expand on your competence in that trough, the trough dynamic, thinking about the real estate equity, or I guess overall non-cash sort of gains, just hoping you can expand on that competence.
John McCallion: Hey, good morning, Mike. It's John. Yes, I think, as both Michelle and I mentioned in our opening remarks, our view is, yes, we've come to a trough. I think, different assets are in kind of different positions. But all in all, in the trough, we've seen some headwinds in real estate, the funds that I mentioned, minus 1.9, but we saw some positive offsets in the PE portfolio. We think that dynamic continues into the next quarter, which is why I mentioned we would generally be in line with now. Obviously it's early. We don't have a ton of, I'll say, objective insight. We have some qualitative commentary and views. We've seen a positive, equity markets, although might be driven by a small number of stocks, depending on how you look at the second quarter. So, but, and that typically directionally translates into some level of, I'll say, the positive in line return, but the betas are typically lower. So that's kind of where we are. We kind of view this trough as more of a U-shaped recovery in this asset class versus kind of a sharp V. But, and we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves. So right now we're, we kind of view that the best view would be kind of in line with Q2.
Michael Ward: Thanks, John. And then maybe for just career benefits overall in the U.S., just curious from your guys' perspective about the climate or the sentiment for U.S. employers, labor market's been pretty resilient. Some headlines around headcount reductions. Just curious what you guys are hearing in that regard and also on wages or, and how that flows into demand for overall benefits. Thanks.
Michel Khalaf: Thanks. I would say from a top line perspective, we're still seeing significant strength across the portfolio. So we're very pleased with our PFO growth. And that's a combination of new customers. It's a combination of good persistency, rate actions for a portion of our portfolio. We've got some tailwinds in terms of wage growth. So we're still seeing very strong momentum there. As Michelle alluded to, we're still seeing double digit growth in our voluntary portfolio. And with a lot of white space, both in terms of customers who don't offer voluntary as well as increasing opportunities to increase penetration within the work site as well. And then I would also just point to the below 5,000 space, which we define as our regional market. National is above 5,000. That is emerging as a particularly bright spot for us. Our PFO growth there is high single digits. We do a fair bit of internal research where we cut the data by market segment. And when you look at that data below 5,000, we're a top three player in that segment, and we're continuing to take share in the fragmented market. So all in all, we're still seeing really positive tailwinds both from the macro environment as well as how we're positioned in this business that's driving PFO growth. That's kind of well within the 4% to 6% range that we have.
Michael Ward: Thanks, guys.
Operator: And next we go to a question from Alexander Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alexander Scott: Hi. First one is a little bit of a housekeeping question. I was just interested in the corporate expense load. It looks a little bit elevated. I know some of that. I know some of that is just part of VII, but even other expenses a bit elevated. So I just wanted to get a feel for if there's anything nuanced going on there in the investment in the business or something we need to be aware of and just confidence around the 650 to 750 annualized number heading  in the back half and into next year.
John McCallion: Good morning, Alex. It's John. As you point out a couple things. One, obviously, VII being below the kind of historical returns puts pressure on C&O as well. So that's probably one driver to maybe the elevated loss that you're referencing. We did have higher expenses in C&O. Obviously, our direct expense ratio came in well. Overall expenses would were very good along with strong top line growth. So our ratio at 12.2 was well below the 12.6. We're still obviously targeting below the 12.6 for full year and it can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but a good quarter nonetheless. In terms of the expenses, if you kind of compare to last year, I'd say probably two main things to highlight. One, interest on debt. It was one item year-over-year. That's a relatively big piece of that. And then the second one is we did have some higher one-time costs in C&O this quarter due to some corporate initiatives. I'll call it that, it was part of just kind of our general efficiency mindset. We don't ever exclude those things. Those are all part of our direct expense ratio, but their investments that we've made to kind of improve our run rate go forward. So hopefully that helps with C&O.
Alexander Scott: Yes, that is helpful. The second one I had for you is just on the pitch downgrade of U.S. debt. I think having two out of three below AAA now probably moves the you know, the composite rating and so maybe that would affect risk rates and yes, it seems like it should be reasonably limited, but just wanted to get your thoughts on, we should expect any material impact RBC from that and, if it affects anything else in your business?
John McCallion: Hey Alex, it's John. Obviously, very recent news. I'm not so sure I saw a ton of reaction yesterday on it and nor do we really think that it has a broad-based impact on, how we run our business or we wouldn't expect capital impacts, but I guess you never know, but right now, we wouldn't expect any impact one way or the other in terms of our, how we run our investment portfolio and our outlooks there. It doesn't change anything.
Alexander Scott: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, for final remarks, I'd like to turn the call back to MetLife's Global Head of Investor Relations, John Hall.
John Hall: Well, thank you everybody for joining us and you know where to find us with any follow-up questions. Thanks very much and have a good day. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-04 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. Pardon me. This is the AT&T operator, we have no sound.
John Hall: [Technical Difficulty] slides that features, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also similarly review. I would like to point out, this is the initial quarter we are reporting our financial results based on the new long duration targeted improvements accounting standard. Please note that prior comparative periods have been recast to conform with LDTI. As usual, after prepared remarks, We will have a Q&A session. In light of the very busy morning, Q&A will end promptly just before the top of the hour. And fairness to everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Throughout MetLife's 155 year history, with risk management at our foundation, we have emerged from times of uncertainty in a stronger position and I expect now to be no different. We remain focused on managing risks across economic cycles and controlling the things we can control to deliver for our shareholders and our other stakeholders. Last night, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.2 billion or $1.52 per share, which compares to $1.7 billion or $2.04 per share a year ago. The quarter's results illustrate MetLife's resilience and underscore our continued strong business momentum and our ability to execute across what we control. We posted strong sales numbers representing responsible growth for most of our key businesses and markets, including Group Benefits, Asia and Latin America. We generated good underwriting results owing to our rigorous price discipline. We continued to manage our costs with vigilance and to beat our expense targets and prudent risk selection helped push recurring investment income higher while new money rate reached 5.8% for the quarter. Reflecting the market, variable investment income fell below our quarterly outlook expectation on the basis of returns on venture capital and real estate equity funds. In total, net income for the quarter was $14 million, driven by losses on opportunistic investment sales in Japan, which offset the tax impact on the gain generated by our recent Japanese A&H reinsurance transaction. Shifting to MetLife's business performance in the quarter, I will start with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings totaled $307 million, up substantially from the prior year, when COVID-19 claims were more elevated with benefit ratios reverting to pre-pandemic seasonal norms. The momentum we've seen over the past several years for this franchise business continued in the quarter. We are strategically well-positioned to grow in this attractive business given our scale, distribution reach, broad product portfolio, enrollment capabilities and importantly our thought leadership. Our differentiation in the space led to strong growth in sales and premium fees and other revenues in all market segments and across voluntary products. In total, sales were up 15%, while adjusted PFOs grew 5.4% toward the top end of our outlook expectation after adjusting for participating policies. For Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $400 million (ph), down from the prior year driven by lower variable investment income. Adjusted PFOs in the quarter benefited from our sustained efforts to grow our structured settlement and our longevity reinsurance businesses. While we did not book any pension risk transfer business in the first quarter, funding levels remained strong. And despite the market turmoil during the first quarter, our capital markets investment products business was able to issue $3.7 billion of funding for the spread business, demonstrating the value of MetLife credit and the broader capital markets. In Asia, adjusted earnings of $280 million were below a year ago on lower variable investment income. Sales on a constant currency basis were up across the board in the region. Japan saw sales rise 17% on the strength of FX annuities, while India led the sales gains in other Asia, up 45% followed by Korea, up 21%. Turning to Latin America, adjusted earnings totaled $215 million, up more than 50% from last year. We are the largest life insurer in Latin America and our business continues to put up impressive growth numbers in our major markets with sales jumping 36% and adjusted PFOs rising 26% both on a constant currency basis. Taking a broader view of investments, rising interest rates are a long-term positive for MetLife. We have a long-time horizon and invest with our liabilities in mind. Our liabilities are sticky and are generally not subject to demand, asset liability management matching the duration of our assets with that of our liabilities, reduces reinvestment risk and is critical to our risk management process. Our investment process has stood the test of time successfully guiding us through the global financial crisis. However, we do not have the luxury to wait until a crisis hits. We look around corners and prepare in advance. Our investment portfolio derisking began in 2019 and we remain up in quality. Our core investment strengths have fashioned us as one of the premier private investors in the world, particularly in private credit and in real estate debt and equity. We have leveraged those strengths to support our policyholders, while building from a standing start, MetLife Investment Management, a leading third-party institutional manager of public fixed income private credit, and real estate. Moving to capital and cash. A tactical element of our business that we control. MetLife was active with capital management during the first quarter. We paid $389 million of common stock dividends to shareholders and we repurchased $780 million of our common stock. Also, we repurchased another $223 million of our common stock during the month of April. On the strength of our balance sheet and our free cash flow, we announced last week a 4% increase in our common dividend per share. We think an increasing common dividend per share is the hallmark of a strong life insurer and MetLife's common dividend per share has grown at a compound rate of 9% since 2011, with roughly $200 million left on our current buyback authorization. As you saw last night, our Board of Directors has authorized an incremental $3 billion increase to our buyback authorization. In the quarter, we announced and closed on the acquisition of Raven Capital Management, an alternative investment manager specializing in direct asset based investments. Aided by MetLife's strategic M&A capabilities, we were able to add an important investment product adjacency that we expect MetLife Investment Management to scale over time. Taken together, these actions demonstrate our commitment to being a sound capital steward for our shareholders. In the absence of responsible organic growth or compelling M&A opportunities, we will return capital over time to our shareholders. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.2 billion of cash at our holding companies, which is above the top end of the $3 billion to $4 billion liquidity buffer we maintain. Our holding company cash fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter. The balance in the first quarter typically reflects lower seasonal operating subsidiary dividends and higher seasonal holding company expenses. Before I close, I would like to take a moment to welcome Jeh Johnson to MetLife's Board of Directors. Jeh joined at the end of April and he brings unique perspective to our Board, having served as Secretary of Homeland Security under President Obama. I am certain Jeh’s talents and experience will serve MetLife well. In closing, while 2023 is shaping up to be another year of uncertainty, the successful actions we've taken to focus simplify and differentiate our business can be seen in the quarter's strong underlying business fundamental, particularly in sales, underwriting and recurring investment margins. Raising the bar and demanding more from ourselves is part of the culture we fostered here at MetLife. If we focus on what we can control with the relentless execution in mind, we can stay ahead of the curve and I am confident we will continue to do so. Now, I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance in greater detail.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 1Q ‘23 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital positions. In addition, we provided some supplemental detail of our investment portfolio given the heightened focus recently. The appendix also includes slides, which provide our full year 2021 and 2022 adjusted earnings re-casted for the new LDTI accounting basis. Starting on Page 3. We provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net investment losses were above trend, primarily driven by sales of fixed maturity securities in Japan. Management took the opportunity to reposition some of the U.S. dollar portfolio to help mitigate some cash tax relating to our recent A&H reinsurance transaction, enhance net investment income, and improve asset liability management within the Japan business. These sales were neutral to a net positive to Japan's solvency margin ratio which is expected to be approximately 725% at the end of March. In addition, net investment losses in the quarter included an increase in the current expected credit loss or CECL allowance, primarily in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio given the current environment. That said, the portfolio remains well positioned and I'll provide more details shortly. We have itemized a new reconciling item between net income and adjusted earnings as a result of LTDI called market risk benefit, over MRB gains and loss. For certain products such as variable annuities with market related guarantees, the change in fair value excluding changes attributable to non-performance risk is recognized in net income each quarter. Similar to certain variable annuity guarantees previously classified outside of adjusted earnings, we'll also now identify MRB gains and losses as a reconciling item between net income and adjusted earnings. This loss was partially offset by derivative gains relating to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates in the quarter drove an MRB loss. This loss was partially offset by derivative gains relating to lower interest rates. However, we had net derivative losses in the quarter as these gains from lower interest rates were more than offset by derivative losses relating to the strong equity markets in Q1 of '23. On Page 4, you can see the first quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which did not have any notable items in either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion, down 30% and down 29% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline while favorable underwriting and higher recurring interest margins were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.52, down 25% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses. Starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $307 million versus $117 million in the prior year period, primarily due to lower COVID-19 claims. The Group Life mortality ratio was 90.5% slightly above the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. As we have noted before, Group Life's mortality ratio tends to be seasonally highest in the first quarter. The drivers were excess mortality due to claims resulting from the year end, flu spike and higher severity. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 72.9% in the quarter, slightly above the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%, but generally in line with higher seasonal dental utilization in the first quarter. Turning to the top line. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 1% year-over-year. As we discussed in prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating life contracts in the period. The higher excess mortality in Q1 of '22 versus Q1 of '23 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premium from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 4 percentage points. Taking participating contracts into account, the underlying PFO increase of approximately 5% was primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary and was within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition, Group Benefit sales were up 15% driven by strong growth across all markets. Retirement Income Solutions or RIS adjusted earnings were down 27% year-over-year, the primary driver was lower variable investment income. This was partially offset by favorable recurring interest margins year-over-year. RIS investment spreads were 117 basis points and 137 basis points, excluding VII, up 37 basis points versus Q1 of '22 and up 13 basis points sequentially, primarily due to higher interest rates and income from in the money interest rate caps. RIS liability exposures were up 1% year-over-year, but solid volume growth was masked due to certain accounting adjustments that do not impact fees or spread income. That said, general account liabilities, which comprise future policy benefits and policyholder account balances collectively grew 5% year-over-year and RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers were up 43%, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products and growth in UK longevity reinsurance. Once again reflecting the power of our diversified set of market leading products in RIS. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 53% and 52% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income. Asia's key growth metrics remained solid as general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 3% on a constant currency basis and sales were up 18% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by strong growth across the region. In Japan, FX annuity sales continued its strong momentum with growth in our face-to-face and bank channels. Latin America adjusted earnings were $215 million, up 59%and up 51% on a constant currency basis. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. Overall, COVID-19 related deaths in Mexico were down significantly year-over-year. The favorable Q1 underwriting benefited from seasonality as well as additional claims favorability in the quarter. In addition, higher recurring interest margins were mostly offset by lower variable investment income year-over-year. Latin America's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 26% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and sales were up 36% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $60 million, up 9% and up 30% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by higher recurring interest margins and solid volume growth. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on a constant currency basis and sales were up 27% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $158 million, down 55%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $236 million versus an adjusted loss of $105 million in the prior year. Lower variable investment income was the primary driver. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 22% at the low end of our 2023 guidance range of 22% to 24%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters, including a $44 million loss in Q1 of '23. Private equity portfolio, which makes up the majority of the VII asset balance and is reported on a one quarter lag, had a positive 0.1% return in the quarter. Venture capital, which now comprises roughly 20% of the $14.2 billion PE portfolio had a negative 6.6% return. The remainder of the PE portfolio had a positive 1.9% return. In addition, real estate equity funds, which comprise roughly $2.3 billion of VII assets, and are also reported on a one quarter lag, had a negative 5.9% return in Q1 of ‘23. While VII underperformed this quarter and is approximately 4% of the portfolio. The three, five and 10 year cumulative private equity annual returns through Q1 of '23 were 19.8%, 17.2% and 16%, respectively. Demonstrating the long-term value of incorporating this asset class into our asset and liability management. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the four quarters of 2022 and Q1 of ‘23. As we have noted previously, each of the businesses holds its own discrete investment portfolios, which have been built to match each liabilities. Although not readily apparent in the chart, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given the long dated liability profile. Also, Corporate & Other currently holds an outsized amount of VII assets. We expect to reduce this balance over time as part of our normal ALM process. Now turning to Page 7. The chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment and income between recurring and VII for the past three years and Q1 of '22 versus Q1 of '23. While VII has shown lower than trend returns over the last few quarters, recurring investment income was up roughly $850 million year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. Shifting your attention to the chart on the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yield over the past three years with new money yields continuing to outpace roll-off yields in recent quarters. In this quarter, our global new money yield reached its highest level in more than a decade at 5.82%, 123 basis points higher than the roll off yield. We expect this favorable trend to continue assuming interest rates remain near current levels. Now let's look at our global investment portfolio on Page 8. As you can see in the chart, MetLife general account AUM shown at fair value as of March 31, 2023 is $424 billion. The portfolio is high quality and well diversified by asset class and geography. In constructing the portfolio, we use a disciplined approach to asset and liability management, in-depth underwriting and risk management. MetLife's global footprint combined with the local market expertise of MetLife Investment Management or MIM allows us to source high quality attractive assets that fit the needs of our businesses. Overall, the portfolio is well positioned and built for resilience through uncertain markets. And we have a strong track record of mitigating losses across all asset classes in the portfolio. From 2008 through Q1 of ‘23, our average annual impairment rate was 13 basis points for fixed maturity securities and only 5 basis points for commercial mortgage loans. Now let's discuss our commercial mortgage loan portfolio in more detail on Page 9. As of March 31, the CML portfolio carrying value of approximately $54 billion is well diversified by geography and property type. The CML portfolio is concentrated in high quality properties and in larger primary markets. These loans are typically to the larger and stronger institutional sponsors who are better positioned to effectively manage assets through periods of stress. In addition, almost all of our CML loans earn first-lien positions with less than 0.5% in subordinated loans. The portfolio has a low average loan to value of 58% with a high average debt service coverage ratio of 2.4 times. As shown on the table, only 0.4% of the CML portfolio has a higher than 80% average loan to value ratio and a below 1 times average debt service coverage ratio. The commercial mortgage loan allowance for credit loss stands at $319 million including the roughly $100 million increase in Q1 of '23 and considers the current environment as well as the risk around the economic outlook. We estimate that our allowance for credit loss is sufficient to cover current expected credit losses in the CML portfolio. The delinquency rate on the portfolio is only 5 basis points and is related to one loan as of March 31, 2023. With regards to loan maturities, only 14% of the CML portfolio are scheduled to mature in 2023 with 36% of these loans already favorably resolved through extensions or payoffs. Of our remaining 2023 maturities, we expect most will be similarly resolved with only 0% to 3% of our 2023 maturities potentially resulting in defaults. If the full 3% or approximately $200 million of loans were to default, this could result in an impairment of up to approximately $15 million. Continuing on Page 10, let's drill down further on our office commercial mortgage portfolio. As of March 31, the office loan portfolio was approximately $21 billion or 4.9% of our total general account AUM. The portfolio is high quality with 89% collateralized by Class A properties, which have seen less market pressure. The portfolio also has an attractive average loan to value ratio of 57% and an average debt service coverage ratio of 2.4 times. As shown on the table, less than 1% of the office CML portfolio has a higher than 80% average loan to value and below 1 time average debt service coverage ratio. The office CML portfolio is geographically diverse across Class A markets in the U.S. and internationally. While we remain confident in the office portfolio given this high quality, we have been very selective on new office loan production in the current environment. In 2022, office loans represented only 8% of our total U.S. commercial mortgage loan production. And since 2016, we have reduced our overall office exposure from approximately 50% of the CML portfolio down to 39% today. Now let's switch gears to discuss expenses on Page 11. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters, including 12% in Q1 of '23. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q1 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. We remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio of 12.6% or below in 2023, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 12. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at March 31, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion and down from $5.4 billion at December 31. The sequential decline in cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend and share repurchases of roughly $800 million in the first quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Our first quarter tends to be lower in subsidiary dividends and higher in holding company expenses. As illustrated in the chart, you can see that the same seasonal pattern occurred from 4Q of '21 into Q1 of '22. Regarding our statutory capital. For our U.S. companies, our 2022 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 367% which is above our target ratio of 360%. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter year-to-date, 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1 billion, while net income was approximately $700 million. Statutory operating earnings increased roughly $500 million year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting, partially offset by lower variable investment income and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.7 billion as of March 31, 2023, down 3% compared to December 31, 2022 due to derivative losses from certain equity options and dividends paid, partially offset by higher operating earnings. Finally, as I referenced earlier, we expect that Japan’s solvency margin ratio to be approximately 725% as of March 31, which will be based on a statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife's results reflect the strength of our business fundamentals, solid top line growth, favorable underwriting and ongoing expense discipline. While private equity and real estate funds underperformed this quarter, core spreads remained robust. In addition, results in our market leading franchises, Group Benefits and Latin America continued their strong top and bottom line growth. While market fluctuations are expected to continue, MetLife remains in a position of strength given our balance sheet, investment portfolio, free cash flow generation and the diversification of our market leading businesses. Finally, our commitment to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth, positions MetLife to build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Good morning. Couple of investment questions. So John, the 19% of office CMLs that mature in ‘23, you guys said 36% of them have been resolved so far through the end of April. Can you just elaborate a bit on what's actually happening there? What does resolved mean? I know, I think you mentioned either pay down or extended. As you're going through that process, are you – are most of them actually paying off a maturity? I assume there's not a lot of liquidity out there, so you're probably extending more than you're seeing payment in principle at the end here? And then also what kind of yields are you getting, assuming you are extending a lot of these or restructuring? Are you getting yields commensurate with the higher risk in the market for that asset class right now or are you having to subsidize amid all? Sorry for the rapid fire questions, but wanted to just get a better sense for what's happening.
Steven Goulart: Good morning, Tom. It's Steve, and thanks for those questions. And talking about kind of what's happening, how we're managing the portfolio today. And John did give some high-level numbers. And when you look at how we're actually managing the portfolio, and there of course are a number of ways to resolve, most of what we're doing right now is on extending, but those are all extension options that are part of the original contract, where it's the borrowers' option to extend or not. And when they do, they still have to meet all of the various restrictions and requirements of the contract, including financial status, terms and conditions and the like. And there's usually a fee paid with it too. And they're generally all that market. So that's where we do see a lot of the activity in resolving the portfolio. And then looking at the -- we have conversations with virtually every borrower who has a maturity coming up this year. And basically, I think most of the borrowers who have that extension option probably will exercise them. We actually are seeing payoffs though, across the portfolio as well, so I think that that's a strong result too. I think, when we look at sort of numbers of loans, probably on the order of a quarter the loans, we're actually paying off to. So we're actively managing the portfolio as we always do, with obviously a heightened sense of attention today, but very confident. And John gave numbers, we think that there will be a very, very small number of -- or closures likely when we're through this year.
Tom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks.
Steven Goulart: And your second question was, well, I can expand. I sort of answered your second question just saying the extensions are at market, but -- and also what I'd say is, yeah, this is a market where we're very picky. And looking at all of the office -- well, frankly, across all of the commercial loan space, we're getting kind of a minimum of 200 basis points over likely indices on floating rate loans or on treasury indices. And if we were to do an office, it would probably be at least 100 basis point premium over that too. So it's a market, where again you have to be very cautious, but there are opportunities as we've seen through other cycles in the past.
Tom Gallagher: That's really helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Last year, at the end of '22, I think you had a big increase in CM 3-rated (ph) loans that had an adverse impact on RBC. Can you talk about what you expect for migration positive or negative for '23?
Steven Goulart: Yeah. And I think, first, we probably want to just address what happened with those numbers for the 2022 migration, because it's a fairly unique circumstance. I mean we do a reasonable amount of floating rate loans about 30% of our portfolio are in floating-rate loans. And just the way the mechanics of those LTV calculations work, there are lags involved. Net operating income is a three-year average, so when you think about something like caps, those basically kind of get delayed in how they work into the actual calculations. And so we do see that migration, but again over time, that cap income will also get incorporated in, obviously depending on the overall interest rate environment, so when we look at it, we're not really concerned that that's a credit issue. It's really just more the mechanics of the formulation and the timing. So that's what really is driving it. We wouldn't expect significant negative deterioration across the portfolio other than just the mechanics.
Tom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And next, we move on to a question from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Hi. Thank you. Maybe, Steve sticking with you for one and maybe just stepping back, I was hoping you could provide sort of an estimate as you think of kind of a more severe stress scenario for commercial real estate and office in particular. How do you think about what the potential capital impacts are in total if you add up impairments and ratings migration?
Steven Goulart: Thanks, Erik. That's certainly is something that we spend a lot of time looking at and we regularly stress test the portfolio. We've just gone through another round of that testing, no surprises, just given what's happening in the market. And what I'd say, summary is, we're very comfortable with the portfolio. The implications of severe stress tests are really very modest. And what we did in our most recent stress test scenario is, we assume that all valuations across the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio declined by 30% to 35% from where they are today. So think about that. That's pretty severe. And then you work that through in terms of impact on net operating income, loan migrations, foreclosures, REO impacts. The net impact to us from a capital perspective, we estimate, would really only be about 10 to 15 RBC points over three years. So when you really put that in the context of what it means to capital, it's very, very modest impact. And I think that is a very severe stress case as well. So I think it just -- it points to the overall strength of the portfolio and the overall strength of our capital.
Erik Bass: Thank you. Very helpful perspective. I guess, maybe turning to the business. For Latin America, you continue to see strong growth and it looks like you're running well ahead of what your guidance would imply for 2023 earnings even with some of the headwinds from VII and encaje (ph) this quarter. So I guess, is there anything unusually strong in the underwriting results in 1Q or is $200 million plus of run rate earnings kind of a reasonable expectation?
Eric Clurfain: Yes. Hi, Erik. This is Eric. So let me shed a little bit more color around LatAm, first, and then answer your question. So we have, as you know, a significant footprint in the three largest markets in the region. We are market leaders with a very strong brand in Mexico and Chile and a very fast growing presence in Brazil. Our strategy around the region is really centered around three pillars. One is protecting the core. The other one is growth through diversification. And all that underpins through a transformation to meet our customers' and our partners' evolving need. So I can give you a couple of examples that -- of the execution of this strategy around the region. So in Mexico, which is our third largest market globally, we have a very unique worksite government franchise that continues to grow very nicely, but in parallel, we've been very successful in diversifying and expanding that distribution reach into the private sector both in retail and group. In Chile, where we have a very strong face-to-face agency franchise, we're growing very fast our bancassurance and third-party distribution. And then in Brazil, which now represents roughly 20% of the region's sales, we're also growing very, very fast with 60% year-over-year this quarter alone. And there the focus is really on bancassurance and third-party distribution, so that continued momentum across the region really reflects the strength and diversity of our distribution channels and product offerings combined with the technology investments that allow us to continue to differentiate for our customers and our distribution channel. So overall, we believe we're really well positioned in the region to capture the growth opportunities that these markets that are still underpenetrated and underserved have to offer. Now going back to this quarter's results and your question particularly: This was another strong quarter on the heels of a record year, but as mentioned by John, this quarter strong results included about roughly $20 million of favorable underwriting really driven by seasonality and overall favorable claims experience. But that being said, we believe that the guidance we provided is still a reasonable run rate for the remaining of the year for the region. So I hope this helps, I give you a little bit more context around LatAm.
Erik Bass: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Next we go to the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Tracy Benguigui: Good morning. Just want to touch upon VII. In today's environment, do you still feel like $500 million of quarterly alternative asset returns is still an appropriate run rate? And if you can also touch upon what you're seeing intra quarter?
Steven Goulart: Hi, Tracy. It's Steve. I guess I'd go back to how we talk about VII fairly consistently. And recall, we're not trying to predict quarterly, monthly, interim returns. I mean we really set our projection based on our long-term performance track record in the classes. And that's how we've come to the 12% number, 3% a quarter. So that's always our standard projection. Certainly, as we go through the year, we do look and given the lag, we can look and try and make some connections to what's happening in the markets. And I think that kind of relates to a little bit of what John talked about on our performance, although venture capital certainly was something that everyone was focused on for a while, so I think we did see those negative returns come through in the last quarter. So again looking ahead, I mean, I'd still look at what the overall market has done in the previous quarter just given the lag that will serve as some directional indicator for where we are. And I think our view is always that our portfolio should be less volatile and probably less extreme on returns than the overall market. So again I think, compared to last quarter, venture capital took a big hit across the rest of the portfolio. We actually saw pretty decent returns and looking at the LBO portfolio and some of our specialty sector like power, infrastructure, energy and those sorts of portfolios. So there is performance and I guess, I'd just look at the overall market as an indicator.
John McCallion: Yeah. And I would just maybe add, Tracy. I mean I think obviously Q1 is a -- year-end marks. We're moving into now Q1 -- Q2 being off of Q1 results, so I think directionally we would be kind of optimistic that it would improve from Q1. Maybe we don't revert back to plan, but I think we're on kind of an upward trend.
Tracy Benguigui: Got it. And the first quarter was an active FABN quarter, you raised $3.7 billion. And some of these coupons not surprisingly were much higher than what we've seen historically. So my question is, do you feel like this product is attractive in today's environment or you could still earn like a 200, 300 spread by reinvesting or was the first quarter activity more a function of refinancing maturing issues?
Steven Goulart: I'd say both. It was elevated activity-wise just because of maturities that we wanted to refinance, but we manage the program very actively. And it still meets all of our target thresholds for returns and income on the portfolio, so we're very happy with the returns.
Tracy Benguigui: So what kind of assets are you reinvesting in, in today's environment to make that return?
Steven Goulart: Yeah. And again you have to go and look at the maturity because again it's still overall match portfolio, but what we're looking at are really mostly fixed maturities, structured finance, some private assets, not much in the way of real estate these days.
Tracy Benguigui: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mr. Bhullar, do you have your phone muted, we don't hear you. We will attempt to come back to him. One moment, please. Next, we'll move on to the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You addressed most of this, but I just had one more question on CM ratings. When you do extend commercial mortgage loans, does that trigger resetting LTV and all the metrics that go into the CM ratings or does it kind of maintain the prior metrics that already existed?
Steven Goulart: I mean, Ryan, I'd really relate it more to just our overall valuation process. When loans get refinanced or extended, there's a valuation that's right in line with our normal valuation process, so -- and like I said, most of the extensions we're doing are extensions that are at borrower's options who've met all the financial criteria required for the loan, so we wouldn't expect to see migration as a result of that.
Ryan Krueger: Okay. Got it. And then just one on retirement spreads that came in quite high on a base level excluding VII. Is that a level that you think in the current rate environment can be maintained near term?
John McCallion: Good morning, Ryan. It's John. So like you said RIS spreads, I think overall 117, but ex-VII, were very strong in the first quarter at 137. And just recall, our overall all-in range was 135 to 160. So again, if you kind of add back a normal contribution to VII that would have been certainly high end of the range. And look, I think we highlighted this on the outlook call. We did think that the first half of '23, certainly based on the forward curve would have, I'll say, the higher end of spreads just given our in the money caps. We probably think Q2 has some kind of similarity to Q1 at this point for ex-VII spreads. And then we'll need to see how the forward curve and how rates progress through the rest of the year.
Ryan Krueger: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we move to a question from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
John Barnidge: Good morning. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Can you maybe talk about persistency of renewals in the group business? We've heard other participants talk about letting business walk that didn't match pricing objectives with this renewal season after a couple years of elevated experience, so curious your thoughts there. Thank you.
Ramy Tadros: Thank you, John. It's Ramy here. Maybe let me just give you the punchline in terms of the results we're seeing. Our persistency in terms of the Q1 renewals was extremely strong and it was higher than prior year across all of our major markets. So we're seeing very strong persistency alongside renewal actions that were very much in line with our expectations, so we're very pleased about the outcome as we go into the year. Maybe just to give you a bit of flavor on that: We've always talked about the group business as a business where price is important, but it's also a business where you can differentiate on many factors beyond price, right? And you certainly see that in our national accounts franchise. Our average customer has been with us for more than two decades. You see that in the very wide breadth of our products which allow us to be much more consultative with our customers and meet their needs. And you also see that because of our scale. So our scale has continued to afford us the ability to invest in our capabilities across the business and therefore drive greater persistency and stickiness with our customers, so all in all a very strong persistency as well as a rate action story for us in the first quarter.
John Barnidge: Great. Thank you. And as a follow-up question, on Raven Capital. I see you, you obviously, announced another buyback authorization, but can you talk about market volatility and opportunities that may create to do other acquisitions either in products or geographic interest specifically? Thank you.
Michel Khalaf: Yeah. Hi, John. It's Michel. The first thing I would point to is really the consistency in terms of our capital deployment. And you can see that over, I would say, a number of years and it was again evident in the first quarter. So if you just look at the first quarter, one, we saw sales growth across most of our key markets and businesses, so we're deploying capital to support responsible growth. We are active from an -- we were active from an M&A perspective. We announced the acquisition of Raven Capital Management, which adds an attractive adjacency to our main business which we think we can scale over time. We deployed $389 million in dividends and we announced a 4% increase in our dividend. Again if you look at the increase since 2011, 9% annual compound rate increase. And then we bought $780 million in our shares in Q1, another $223 million in April. And we have a new $3 billion authorization from our Board. Our liquidity at the -- we're above our liquidity buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion at the Holdco, so if you take all of these together, I think they signal sort of confidence in terms of our financial strength and the free cash flow generation capabilities of our businesses. So again, we're confident in terms of how we're positioned. And we'll continue to sort of explore M&A opportunities, provided those fit strategically or accretive over time, meet our minimum risk adjusted hurdle rates and the like. And we'll remain also disciplined on that front as we always have been. So hopefully, that gives you some color.
John Barnidge: It does. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next, we go to Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. Ramy, I was hoping you could unpack the group disability results a little bit in terms of what you saw in the quarter. We did have one company yesterday talked about sort of a pretty significant improvement in loss ratios and then actually persisting for the balance of the year. I'm just wondering how your business is doing and if there's any expectation for ongoing improvement as we move through '22 -- sorry, '23?
Ramy Tadros: Good morning and thank you for the questions. So inside our non-medical health ratio, disability business is a contributor to that. And we have certainly seen favorability in our disability results this quarter, and that favorability came in through both lower incident rates as well as stronger recoveries. And when we think about that favorability, there are some external factors in the environment and there are some internal drivers as well. So externally, you could look at the low unemployment levels as well as the fact that we're now clearly out of the pandemic environment, which kind of decreased the pressure on the STD line. So a favorable environment in Q1. Internally, when you look at disability, this is a product where our customers have complex needs. And here again, I would point to scale and investment you need to make here to really differentiate yourself in the marketplace and particularly differentiate yourself in terms of outcomes. So in our case, that's come from investments in our human capital. We've built a world-class team of clinicians who diligently work on returning people to health. We deploy data and analytics on our pricing, underwriting and our claims process. We have a world-class capabilities in terms of leave and absence, which again when packaged with LTD drive greater customer value and persistency in our books, so certainly a favorable disability ratio. As we think about the rest of the year, we continue to -- from a pricing perspective, we continue to bake in a load for softness in the environment. I mean it's so, that from a pricing and renewal perspective we continue to look at that and continue to bake in a pricing loan to make sure that our margins are resilient should we see softness from the claims side.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then maybe just pivoting to Steve on the CML portfolio. I know that Class B is a pretty small percentage of the office book, but as we think about those scheduled maturities for '23 and '24, any sense of, is it -- like what's the piece of it related to Class B? Have you resolved any of the Class B loans? Just some color on that would be helpful.
Steven Goulart: Hey, Suneet. We didn't -- we haven't broken out the maturities. Again I think, if you look at the overall resolution and the path we're down, it's very strong for the overall portfolio, extension options were they are provided at market with fees and a good number of payoffs to -- so I'm sorry. I don't have the specific breakdown, but I'm very pleased with the overall structure of our resolution right now.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Next, we go to a question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, I believe in your prepared remarks you guys mentioned that you might want to right-size the VII portfolio over time. Was that an overall comment on the portfolio, or was that just related to the corporate segment?
John McCallion: Hey, Elyse. It's John. Yeah. I made the comment. I mean we -- more because, as you've seen, we probably have a little bit of outsized sensitivity in C&O for VII. It was a function of a number of things. Remember, last year, a year ago, we were able to monetize about $1 billion of our private equity portfolio. We also, just with some asset and liability management, moved a bit more into Corporate & Other. I would call that a holding pattern for now. And that's really the comment I'm making. And so it does, I think, on the margin cause us to probably -- we're not stopping our investment, but it's -- relatively speaking, it's the new commitments are a bit slower. But they're -- we're still doing that. We want to always invest through the cycle, but that was the gist of the comment.
Elyse Greenspan: And then your direct expense ratio, 12%, was pretty stable on year-over-year. And outside of group, it doesn't look like expenses moved much. How much active expense management is going on? And how much underlying pressure are you guys seeing from wage inflation or other drivers?
John McCallion: Yeah. It's John again, Elyse. As you said, it was a good result for the quarter. Look, how much -- a lot of active management, a lot. And inflation is -- has been challenging. And I think we've seen that throughout the insurance industry in -- on both sides, and it's a challenging environment. And as a result, it takes active management. And I think our -- the culture here has been really strong around efficiency mindset. We continue to use that mentality to build capacity so that we can continue to invest in -- through these cycles and not let things like inflation slow us down. And it gives us optionality should we see more stressful environment. So I think the team has done a really, really great job, but it's -- every day, it's active management.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alexander Scott: Hi. Good morning. First one I had is for -- on Asia. Can you talk about the organic growth there and particularly how U.S. rates and I guess, JGB (ph) rates are impacting your annuities business there and in particular your ability to sell new product and have attractive product in the market?
Lyndon Oliver: Hi, Alex. It's Lyndon. Yes, look, we really are benefiting from the U.S. rate movement. It's really giving us an advantage as we compare to the Japanese rates. We've seen demand for the foreign currency products go up consistently over the year. If we look at fourth quarter sales, annuities were very strong and that continues as we go into the first quarter. So as far as rates go, it really puts us in an advantage as we're selling this product, but if you look at the fluctuation in the foreign currency, that is -- really kind of makes the market tentative going into the product. So overall I think rates have really benefited us in this environment.
Alexander Scott: And then along the same lines, just, in LatAm, I just wanted to kind of peel back the organic growth a little bit and see if you can tell us a little bit about what you're doing, whether it's on distribution or actions that you're taking that are allowing for such strong organic growth and seemingly market share taking.
Eric Clurfain: Yeah. Hi. This is Eric. So yeah, as I mentioned earlier, really it’s a combination of diversifying our distribution, combined with the introduction of new digital tools and active distribution growth through different channels. And our – again, our breadth and depth of our franchises in the key largest markets across the region.
Alexander Scott: Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have no more time for questions. I will turn the call back to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you for joining us today. And we appreciate your patience with the technical difficulties at the beginning of our call. We look forward to seeing you over the course of the quarter and have a nice day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings and Outlook Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about the forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's fourth quarter 2022 earnings and near-term outlook call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides which address the quarter as well as our near term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to the slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In light of the busy morning, Q&A will promptly end at the top of the hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As I look back on 2022, I am pleased with the relevance of our Next Horizon strategy and how it positioned us to absorb the challenges presented in the year and to succeed going forward. 2022 was a year still affected by COVID, and we incurred an impact of more than $650 million pretax. For the year, we saw pretax variable investment income come in 19% lower than our outlook expectation on lower returns in our private equity portfolio. And from a macroeconomic perspective, we felt pressure from rising inflation, a falling equity market and a stronger dollar. Yet despite these hurdles, MetLife performed. Our strategy proved its resilience and our consistent execution driven by discipline and determination paid off in 2022. We delivered an adjusted return on equity of 12.3% for the year, meeting our target for this important metric. We pushed ourselves, driven by our efficiency mindset and succeeded in posting a full year direct expense ratio of 12.2%. Our strong 2022 free cash flow generation enabled us to hit our 2 year free cash flow ratio target of 65% to 75%. This fueled the return of $4.9 billion of cash to our shareholders. And finally, we ended the year with $5.4 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, arming us with ample financial flexibility. With our great set of market-leading businesses, good growth prospects around the world and the strength of our balance sheet and our free cash flow generation, I believe MetLife is very well positioned for the future. When we established our Next Horizon strategy at the end of 2019, we made several 5 year commitments against which we measure ourselves and, more importantly, hold ourselves accountable. I am pleased with our success to date in meeting those commitments. Even more, I am confident that we will beat each one. We committed to an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14%. Today, we are boosting our target adjusted ROE range to 13% to 15%. This reflects, in part, our growth combined with our sustained discipline in pricing our products and in managing our capital. We said we would generate $20 billion over 5 years of free cash flow. We expect to exceed this target. We committed to freeing up an additional $1 billion over a 5 year period to invest in growth and innovation. Again, we are on track to overachieve against this target, and we are reaping the benefit of these investments. When we made these commitments, we did not expect U.S. interest rates to approach the lowest level in history, neither did we contemplate a global pandemic. While the environment may change, our accountability does not. We are also not content to maintain the status quo. We seek to challenge ourselves and push for more to raise the bar. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter 2022 results. Last night, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.2 billion or $1.55 per share, which compares to $1.8 billion or $2.17 per share a year ago. We generated strong underwriting results as COVID losses retreated further, while our recurring investment income continues to grow on higher new money rates. This was offset by variable investment income falling below our quarterly outlook expectation and a stronger dollar. Shifting to the full year 2022, the diversification of MetLife's portfolio of market-leading businesses once again proved its value. Most of our businesses and segments have returned to underlying levels of earnings equal to or greater than prior to the pandemic. Our U.S. Group Benefits business is a clear leader in this attractive segment of the life insurance industry. During the year, we grew our Group Benefits PFOs roughly 5% on top of double-digit growth the year prior. Our growth in Group Benefits represents more than $1 billion of new PFOs, bringing full year Group Benefit PFOs to approximately $23 billion. These numbers matter. First, we bring the broader set of products to our customers, life, dental, disability, vision, A&H, legal and pet insurance among many others, more than any other carrier. Second, Group Benefits is a business where you have to make significant investments to keep up with evolving customer and employer expectations. Our scale enables us to make those investments, to add products and capabilities and to further digitize and enhance the customer experience. All of this adds up to drive the growth and persistency we've achieved in our Group Benefits business over the last several years as well as the growth we expect to achieve in the future. Moving to highlights from other segments and businesses. Our Retirement and Income Solutions business produced its strongest year of pension risk transfer volume in our history, more than $12 billion, including our largest ever single deal. Our Asia segment continued to generate strong sales growth, topping 11% on a constant currency basis in a market that remained in COVID's grip for much of the year. And our Latin America segment enjoyed both strong top and bottom line results, particularly in Mexico, as a heightened awareness of the importance of the products we offer, coupled with a flight to quality, drove sales up 26% on a constant currency basis, pushed persistency higher and added to adjusted earnings. Moving to capital and cash. MetLife is well capitalized and has plenty of liquidity, well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our U.S. and international insurance businesses are self-funding. Our strong capital and liquidity position allows us to meet our commitments and obligations, but also equips us with the financial flexibility to seize attractive opportunities that may present an unsettled environment. We have built a clear track record in terms of how we deploy capital to its highest use. If we have opportunities to put capital to work organically or via mergers and acquisitions at appropriate risk-adjusted hurdle rates, we will do so. Case in point, we deployed approximately $3.8 billion of capital to support organic new business in 2022. Absent such opportunities, we will return capital to shareholders. In 2022, we paid to MetLife shareholders $1.6 billion of common stock dividends, and we repurchased $3.3 billion of common stock. In January, we purchased roughly an additional $250 million of common stock, and we have around $900 million remaining on our current authorization. Before I close, I would like to take a moment to recognize a true visionary in the history of MetLife. Harry Cayman, MetLife's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer from 1993 to 1998, passed away on December 20 at the age of 89. Harry spent nearly his entire career at MetLife, starting as a junior attorney. As Chairman and CEO, Harry infused MetLife with a new corporate vision and an emphasis on profitable growth, something very much in line with our current focus on responsible growth. Harry's passing reminds us of the debt we owe at MetLife to those that went before us and building this great company since its founding in 1868. In closing, our Next Horizon strategy continues to prove its resilience in a changing and shifting environment. Our total shareholder return of more than 19% in 2022 underscores the significant value we created for our shareholders against this backdrop. As we look ahead, our work is not done. We are raising the bar and setting our standards higher. As much as we have accomplished in recent years, I believe there is still much ahead for us to achieve. As the world has opened up, I was able to spend more time on the road than the last half of 2022 since the start of the pandemic. I'm more invigorated than ever to get out and meet face-to-face with our customers, our distribution partners, our employees and our shareholders. I look forward to updating some and introducing others to what we're building up MetLife, a company capable of being a quality compounder across a range of economic cycles. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in 4Q of '22 was $1.3 billion or $88 million higher than adjusted earnings. Net investment gains in the fourth quarter were primarily driven by real estate sales, which were partially offset by losses on the fixed maturity portfolio due to normal trading activity in a rising rate environment. Credit losses in the portfolio remain modest. In addition, we had net derivative gains primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. For the full year, net derivative losses accounted for most of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings, primarily due to higher interest rates in 2022. Overall, our hedging program continues to perform as expected. On Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $140 million of notable tax items that were favorable in the fourth quarter of '21 and accounted for in Corporate and Other. Adjusted earnings in 4Q of '22 were $1.2 billion, down 28% and down 26% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline, while higher recurring interest margins and favorable underwriting were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.55, down 23% year-over-year and down 21% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $400 million versus $20 million in 4Q of '21, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 life claims, as well as higher volume growth. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. Group Life mortality ratio was 87.6% in the fourth quarter of '22, in the middle of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 69.4% in Q4 of '22, slightly below its annual target range of 70% to 75% and below the prior year quarter of 74.2%. The non-medical health ratio benefited from favorable disability severity, while dental was in line with expectations. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were essentially flat year-over-year. As we discussed in prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating life contracts in the period. The higher excess mortality in Q4 '21 versus Q4 of '22 resulted in year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 6 percentage points. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 6% was primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. For the full year, Group Benefits adjusted PFO growth was 3%, while underlying growth, excluding excess premiums from participating contracts in 2021 versus 2022 was up 5% and within the 2022 target range of 4% to 6%. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 40% year-over-year. The primary driver was lower variable investment income, mostly due to weaker private equity returns. This was partially offset by favorable recurring interest margins year-over-year. RIS investment spreads were 96 basis points and 112 basis points excluding VII, up 21 basis points versus Q4 of '21 and up 11 basis points sequentially, primarily due to income from in-the-money interest rate caps. RIS liability exposures were down 1% year-over-year due to certain accounting adjustments that do not impact fees or spread income. That said, RIS had strong volume growth driven by sales up 23% in 2022. This was primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products. In addition, we had a record sales quarter for structured settlements, demonstrating the strength of product diversification within RIS. With regards to PRT, we completed 6 transactions worth $12.2 billion in 2022, a record year for MetLife, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 63% and down 62% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income. In addition, we had a write-down of a deferred tax asset in China as it was determined that the accumulated tax losses were unlikely to be utilized within the required 5 year statutory period. The write-down of the DTA reduced Asia's adjusted earnings in Q4 of 2022 by $34 million after tax and was accounted for in net investment income due to the equity method of accounting treatment for our China joint venture. While Asia's underwriting was modestly unfavorable versus Q4 of '21, we saw a significant sequential improvement due to lower COVID claims in Japan. Asia's key growth metrics remained solid as general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 4% on a constant currency basis. And sales were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by FX annuities sold through face-to-face channels in Japan. For the full year, Asia sales were up 11%, exceeding its 2022 guidance of mid to high-single digits. Latin America adjusted earnings were $181 million, up 45% and up 51% on a constant currency basis. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. Overall, COVID-19related deaths in Mexico were down significantly year-over-year. In addition, the Chilean encaje, which had a positive 6% return in 4Q '22 versus 4% in the prior year and higher recurring interest margins, were positive contributors. These two favorable items were partially offset by lower variable investment income year-over-year. LatAm's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs are up 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $70 million, up 67% and up 112% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by favorable underwriting versus Q4 of '21, which had elevated COVID-19-related claims, particularly in the U.K. This was partially offset by less favorable expenses year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 2% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting solid growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $208 million, down 57%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. In addition, less favorable expense margins and adverse equity market performance also reduced adjusted earnings year-over-year. Corporate and Other adjusted loss was $219 million versus an adjusted loss of $177 million in the prior year, which excludes favorable notable tax items of $140 million. Higher taxes and lower net investment income were partially offset by lower expenses year-over-year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 19%, which includes favorable tax benefits primarily related to the settlement of an IRS audit. Excluding these favorable items, the company's effective tax rate was approximately 22%, within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2022. VII was $24 million in the fourth quarter. The private equity portfolio, which makes up the bulk of the VII asset balances, had a negative 0.3% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities generally accounted for on a one quarter lag. For the full year, VII was $1.5 billion, below our 2022 target range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Our private equity portfolio had a positive 7% return in 2022, a solid performance in comparison to the public equity markets with the S&P 500 down 19%. While VII underperformed in 4Q '22, our new money rate increased to 5.66%, which was 150 basis points above our roll-off yield of 4.16%. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the four quarters and full year 2022. On a full year basis, you will note RIS MetLife Holdings in Asia continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income, consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-dated liabilities, which are mostly in these three businesses. Turning to Page 7. This chart shows the comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior eight quarters and full year 2021 and 2022. Our direct expense ratio in 4Q of '22 was elevated at 13.1%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs in Group Benefits, as well as higher employee-related costs and timing of certain projects. That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2022, our direct expense ratio was 12.2%, below our annual target of 12.3%. We believe this result once again demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset in a challenging inflationary environment while continuing to make investments in our businesses. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.4 billion at December 31, which was up from $5.2 billion at September 30 and remained above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $600 million in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. For the 2 year period, 2021 to 2022, our average free cash flow ratio, excluding notable items, totaled 68% and was within our 65% to 75% target range. In terms of statutory capital for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2022 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2022 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $2.6 billion, while net income was approximately $3 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of 3% sequentially, primarily due to derivative losses and dividends paid, partially offset by operating earnings and investment gains. Finally, while our Japan solvency margin ratio dipped below 500% as of September 30, we expect the Japan SMR to be approximately 700% as of December 31, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. As we have discussed on prior calls, our Japan business as well as MetLife overall does better economically in a higher interest rate environment. However, given the asymmetrical nature of how the SMR is calculated, the ratio declines in a rising rate environment as assets are mark-to-market, but not the corresponding liabilities. As a result, we executed an internal reinsurance transaction in December with our Bermuda entity, which has an economic-based solvency regime. This transaction improved the Japan SMR ratio by approximately 250 percentage points. Before I shift to our near-term outlook, starting on Page 9, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 15 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2017 through 2021. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q '22 supplemental slides, but we felt it was worth including again for the sake of completeness. Also, Pages 16 through 19 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business. Turning back to Page 9, our 2023 to 2025 outlook reflects the impacts of the new accounting requirements of long-duration targeted improvement or LDTI. While 2022 actually used for growth rate calculations remain as previously reported on a pre-LDTI basis. In mid-April or roughly two to three weeks prior to the reporting of our 1Q '23 earnings, we plan to provide you with a recasted QFS based on LDTI for each of the quarters in 2022. While there would be certain positive and negative effects depending on product and segment, we do not expect the underlying run rate of adjusted earnings for the firm overall to change materially. Now let's turn to Page 10 for further details on our near-term outlook. We assume COVID-19 to be endemic, consistent with the recent trends that we have been experiencing. We expect continued uncertainty to persist around inflation and a potential recession in 2023. Based on the 12/31/22 forward curve, we expect interest rates to rise in 2023. Finally, for purposes of the near-term outlook, we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500 and a 12% annual return for private equity. This is consistent with our long-term historical returns for PE. Moving to near-term targets. We are increasing our adjusted ROE range to 13% to 15%. This increase of 100 basis points from our prior 12% to 14% ROE range is a function of the growing impact of our mix of business and higher new business returns over the last several years as well as the impact of LDTI. We expect to maintain our 2 year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items. Our direct expense ratio guidance for 2023 is being recalibrated to reflect LDTI by approximately 30 basis points to 12.6%. This captures an approximate $1 billion reduction in adjusted PFOs, excluding PRTs, due to the change in accounting. This is primarily related to certain annuity contracts within RIS as well as shifting certain variable annuity fees to market risk benefits, which are reported outside adjusted earnings. Since this change in accounting to LDTI will be retroactively applied back to the beginning of 2021, our previously reported direct expense ratios will likewise be recalibrated to put 2021 and 2022 on the same basis as 2023 and beyond. Our VII for 2023 is expected to be approximately $2 billion after applying our historical average returns on asset balances. I'll provide more detail on VII in a moment. Our Corporate and Other adjusted loss target is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax in 2023. We are increasing our expected effective tax rate range by 1 point to 22% to 24% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you'll see certain interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, reflecting a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term. On Page 11, the chart reflects our VII average asset balances from $14.7 billion in 2021 to $19 billion expected in 2023. Private equities will continue to hold the vast majority of our VII asset balances. We are applying our historical annual returns for each asset class within VII. In addition to the PE annual return of 12%, we expect an annual 7% return for real estate and other funds. Finally, as a reminder, we include prepayment fees on fixed maturities and mortgage loans in VII. So now I will discuss our near term outlook for our business segments. Let's start with the U.S. on Page 12. For Group Benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating group life contracts of approximately $750 million in 2022, adjusted PFOs are expected to grow at 4% to 6% annually. Regarding underwriting, we expect the Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%. We are also maintaining the expected group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio at 70% to 75%. Keep in mind, these are annual ratios and are typically higher in the first quarter for both Group Life and Non-Medical Health given the seasonality of the business. For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. We are increasing the range of our expected annual RIS investment spread by 40 basis points to 135 to 160 basis points in 2023. The majority of this increase is driven by continued expectations of rising interest rates on the short end of the curve and the resulting benefit of interest rate cap income, which we expect to peak in the first half of 2023. In addition, LDTI will contribute approximately 10 basis points to the investment spread calculation while not increasing adjusted earnings. Upon transition to LDTI, the unlocking of future cash flow assumptions to current best estimate increased our deferred profit liability, which is amortized into earnings and will now be included in the spread calculation, reducing other sources of earnings. Overall, the conversion to LDTI will not significantly change RIS run rate adjusted earnings. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline 12% to 14% in 2023, driven by the normal runoff of the business, market declines and the transition to LDTI. Beyond 2023, we expect annual PFOs to decline 6% to 8%. We are lowering the life interest adjusted benefit ratio target to 40% to 45% in 2023 from the prior 45% to 50% target to reflect the impact of lowering policyholder dividend levels. Finally, we are maintaining the adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2023. Now let's look at the near-term guidance of our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 13. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid to high-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis over the near term. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis. We expect Asia's adjusted earnings, excluding $270 million of COVID-19 claims in 2022, to grow at mid-single digits over the near term. For Latin America, we expect adjusted PFOs to grow by low double digits over the near term. We expect our adjusted earnings to grow high single digits over the near term, excluding roughly $80 million due to favorable market-related factors in 2022. Finally, for EMEA, we are expecting sales and adjusted PFOs to grow mid to high single digits on a constant currency basis over the near term. We expect EMEA run rate adjusted earnings to be roughly $55 million per quarter in 2023, reflecting the impact of currency headwinds and then grow by high single digits in 2024 and 2025. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a good quarter to close out another strong year, reflecting the strength of our business fundamentals, solid top line growth, favorable underwriting and ongoing expense discipline. While private equity returns were down this quarter, core spreads remained robust. In addition, results in our market-leading franchises, Group Benefits and Latin America continued their strong growth and recovery. Finally, our commitment to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth positions MetLife to build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Q - Erik Bass: Hi. Thank you. So we've recently seen an increase in the number of layoffs announcements, particularly from larger employers. So I was just hoping you could talk about what you're seeing from your clients, particularly in the group business and then what you're assuming for employment and wage inflation in your 4% to 6% PFO growth outlook?
Ramy Tadros: Thanks, Erik. It's Ramy here. So the short answer is we're not seeing any impacts across our group business today; in fact, quite the opposite. So maybe let me give you just a couple of overall points before I get into the specifics of our business. So if you think about a recession and a potential recession, as you know, no two recessions are the same, so sitting here, it's really difficult to speculate how a potential recession scenario could play out in terms of the employment levels and particularly as to which segment of the economy that would impact. And the second point, before I get into the specifics of the business, we've all seen the headlines. But overall, we're still sitting in a pretty tight labor market with pretty - with low unemployment levels. And you also have to remember when you look at group benefits, their underlying long-term trends with respect to the dynamics in the workplace, which really favor benefits, and we see those trends continuing thought out [ph] in the future. So if you think about specifically our franchise, while we're certainly not immune to a downturn, there are a number of important mitigants in our business which make us fairly resilient from a top line and a bottom line perspective and, I would say, give us real confidence sitting here today with respect to our guidance ratios in terms of PFO growth. So let me just give you kind of a bit of a sense of what gives us that confidence. From a top line perspective, our book is highly diversified by industry and by size of employer, which limits our diversification, our exposure to any single segment. So really diversification is our friend here and is crucial to our ability to perform. As we stand here in January, we're off to a great start in '23. We're seeing excellent sales momentum across the business. And we had an in-force book that has performed exceptionally well, both with respect to the 1/1 persistency and renewal as well as the rate actions. And we still see significant growth opportunities in our market, and those are direct results of the investments which Michel referenced. So we've spoken about those in the past, be they be the voluntary opportunity with respect to enrollment strategies in the workplace, be it the market-leading national accounts business that we have or be it growth in regional markets where we see a fragmented marketplace that's consolidating. So all in all, you put all of this thing - all of this picture together in terms of our starting point and the profile of our business, and that gives us a pretty high degree of confidence with respect to the guidance range. The underlying assumptions, specific to your second question, really I'll guide you back to the assumptions that John mentioned in the outlook assumptions with respect to an uncertain environment with the potential for a recession. But despite that, we feel pretty good about our guidance ranges.
Erik Bass: Great. Thanks, Ramy. And then my second question was just on what's enabling the earnings for MetLife Holdings to be so resilient despite the decline in PFOs and then the lower equity markets that we saw last year? I guess related, at what point should earnings start to follow the PFOs lower?
John McCallion: Good morning, Erik. It's John. Great question. We have had some resiliency in our runoff business here. So we did provide a guidance raise of 1 to 1.2. Let me start with just PFO decline versus earnings. So as I referenced in my opening remarks, one aspect of LDTI is for our VAs, we do move some of the fees down below the line. That's a revenue decline, but it's not an earnings decline. The way we have - our policy has been that we've attributed fees to the guarantees. And to the extent that they're below the line, we would put 100% of those fees below the line. So as you move, we have a number of SOP 03-1, which is kind of the accrual-based accounting, as you move them down below the line, so does the claims. So you see this like this kind of breakage between revenue decline but earnings staying flat. And then we did have - this is probably one of the businesses with a marginal positive from LDTI. And so that's probably another item. And then thirdly, I think it's the optimization efforts. Now the team has done a great job and continue to look for ways to find improvements around expenses, around contracts. And I think, all in all, we think with the guidance in terms of equity outlook, 1 to 1.2 is a good range.
Erik Bass: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Good morning. Hey, sticking with Holdings, been a few of your peers like Aegon and Ameriprise saying they're going to pass on doing VA risk transfer deals because the pricing didn't work. I'm wondering whether your view has changed at all or maybe just give an update on what are you thinking about a potential risk transfer deal for Holdings. Has the environment changed there or pricing changed at all?
John McCallion: Good morning, Tom. It's John. Yes, I don't think any update or change for us. I think we've been pretty transparent about this. This is not an easy solution, particularly when you're talking about a reinsurance arrangement. It is complex. I think particularly when it's a reinsurance, you're looking for a good partner and you're looking for to ensure that not only is it beneficial for us, but beneficial for them. And so there is a - you do have to look for ways for common ground. And sometimes that works out, and sometimes it doesn't. It hasn't changed our perspective on optimization. And so I think things are the same for us, so which is we continue to look for ways to optimize internally and we are, and I just referenced that on the previous comment, and that's helped us be resilient in terms of our earnings. And at the same time, we're still going to look and speak and converse with third parties and look for ways to see if we can accelerate the release and runoff of that block in an appropriate way. And if we can, we would do a deal, if we can't, then we'll continue to optimize internally.
Tom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks. And just a follow-up on, if I look at your group life and individual life mortality experience within Holdings, are you seeing worse experience versus pre-pandemic levels right now? Or are you more or less back to those types of levels? The reason I ask is if you look at the broader CDC data for all-cause mortality, it still looks to me like it's running around 5% to 10% worse. Yet I look at your guidance, I look at the results you've had for the last three quarters, you're kind of back to your targets. So I'm just curious what you're seeing. Maybe it's the insured population experience is better than general population, but any way you can kind of reconcile that? Thanks.
Ramy Tadros: Yes, I mean it's - you've got to really factor in a lot of different, call it, lenses as you go from an aggregate data to an insured population or a specific book of business. I would say in terms of what we're seeing this quarter, it's very much a shift to an endemic. With respect to COVID, we see continued reduction in the number of deaths below 65, which also reduces the severity of any potential impacts from COVID. But overall, you really should think about this moving to an endemic environment, one that we've priced for and, therefore, we feel pretty good about our guidance range and going back to the midpoint of the range on an annual basis. You'll still see some of the seasonality we've historically seen. So think about Q1 as typically being mortality heavy, which is - was the same dynamic that played out pre-COVID from a mortality perspective.
Tom Gallagher: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Next, we go on to Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question on the RIS spread outlook. I guess more so to the extent you can comment beyond 2023 and how to think about the interest rate cap, how much they're contributing in '23 and how we should think about them rolling off beyond '23?
John McCallion: Good morning, Ryan. It's John. So as we mentioned, we're raising the guidance. And I think just to kind of frame it in terms of if you use fourth quarter, we're at about 112 ex-VII. If you add 10 for LDTI, which we referenced, it's more of a mechanic than it is necessarily an earnings change or run rate change. And then on top of that, you add kind of a normal VII balance, that gets you to the range we gave. And we are benefiting from the caps. I mean this is really how we constructed the portfolio is to put these in place to address a short-term headwind of rising rates and really rising short-term rates to allow for the longer end of the curve for the rollover and reinvest to start to manifest itself in portfolio yield. So it's all part of the plan. They'll be pretty healthy in '23. They'll start to roll off over the next 2 plus years, and that should give us some time to allow for the longer end of the curve to kind of improve in terms of contribution. We typically stick to '23 - to 1 year, and there's a reason for that. I mean, if you - if we try to predict more than 1 year, I think we would have been wrong every time. So I think we'll stick with that.
Ryan Krueger: Okay. Got it, thanks. And then I guess on capital deployment and are you - I guess there's a lot of talk about the risk of recession. I mean at this point, have you - are you - is there anything about the economic outlook that would lead you to pull back some on capital deployment at this point? Or are you kind of viewing as a somewhat status quo situation for now?
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Hi, Ryan. It's Michel. I mean I would say the short answer is no, no change in philosophy in our approach. And I might sound like a broken record here, but that's probably a good thing. So from our standpoint, the approach is that beyond supporting organic growth and in the absence of strategic accretive M&A, excess capital belongs to shareholders. And we've defined that as cash and equivalents at our holding companies above our liquidity buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. And we do expect to migrate back to those levels over time. But just given the environment, I think having the financial flexibility that being above that range offer is not a bad thing. We've bought back $3.3 billion in 2022, an additional $250 million in January. And we have $900 million left on our current authorization. And as we've done in the past, we're going to continue to manage the authorization deliberately and in a consistent manner, I would say. So from that perspective, no change in terms of approach or philosophy.
Ryan Krueger: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mr. Bhullar, do you have your phone muted by chance. We will move on to the next person, one moment here. We'll move on to Alex Scott [Goldman Sachs]. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott: Hey, good morning. First one I had is just on LDTI, could you provide an update on how book value is impacted as we sort of move over to that accounting as of year-end? And the reason I asked is just I want to better understand the ROE guidance that you've provided as part of your outlook. And then maybe if you can comment at all on how sensitive that will be to interest rates as we think through declining rates in the first quarter?
John McCallion: Good morning, Alex. It's John. So we gave a range before, and we'll be providing a point estimate as we file our 10-K in the middle of that range was, call it, all in about a 22.5 change in total equity and about a $5 billion, so $22.5 billion and a $5 billion change in book value ex-AOCI, excluding FCTA. That was at 1/1/21. Since that time, obviously, a lot has changed in terms of economic and interest rate environments. And so I think if you were to compare to year-end this year of '22, the delta should be much different or smaller, at least, certainly, on book value ex-AOCI would be about 2 - a little less than a $2 billion, call it, impact on book value ex-AOCI. And then if you include AOCI, it actually flips a little bit to $2 billion positive from the overall $22.5 billion negative to GAAP equity. So hopefully, that helps.
Alex Scott: Yes, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then the second one I had is on LatAm and the outlook. You guys have had really strong growth there. How influenced has it all been by the macro environment and the employment in Mexico, which candidly am a little less doubt [ph] in on myself? And I just wanted to understand like, to what degree that's been fueling things and what that could look like if it more levels off or is not as robust as it's been? And then maybe also if the Chile pension reform does go into effect in 2024? Would that change your view on the growth rates on sort of the outer years of the guidance you gave?
Eric Clurfain: Okay. Hi, Alex. This is Eric. Let me take the first question regarding the LatAm outlook. So as you mentioned, and you've seen 2022 results and our near-term guidance, we're excited about our prospects in Latin America for a number of reasons. And let me put things in perspective. So we, as you know, we have a strong franchise across the region. We have a significant footprint in three of the largest insurance markets across LatAm. We are market leaders with a very strong brand in Mexico and Chile, and we have a fast-growing business in Brazil. So in addition, the market in the region has significant potential for three reasons in addition to the one that you mentioned. But the three core reasons that are really pushing things forward are, one, the insurance penetration rates remain very low. We are also seeing heightened protection awareness resulting in increased demand for our products. We're also observing an increased expectations from customers for more of a digital and seamless experience, and this is leading to a flight to quality that I mentioned during last year. And these evolving customer needs have been met by our franchise because we have invested significantly in our digital transformation over the past few years, and that digital transformation in both sales and service levels is now paying off clearly. And in parallel, we've been expanding and diversifying our distribution and product reach by growing bancassurance, direct marketing channels, while continuing to strengthen and grow our retail and group business across the region. The good example of that diversification strategy in Mexico where we had a record top and bottom line here in 2022. So we've been also expanding successfully in the private business in both retail and group while continuing that strong franchise that you know very well in worksite government. So all in all, I think there are market factors that are helping, but the strength of our franchise and our strategy is certainly positioning us well for the future and moving forward. So I hope this helps on the LatAm question. And I'll pass it to Michel regarding the Chile view.
Michel Khalaf: Yes. I mean the thing I would say about Chile is that I think all in all, we feel better about the environment. The pension reform is going to play out over, say, a number of months. And we'll have to see how things turn out. But all in all, I think compared to maybe six months ago, I would say the environment is better, more favorable.
Alex Scott: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we will go back to the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mr. Bhullar, we are still unable to hear you. We will move on to Suneet Kamath [Jefferies]. You may go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Hi. Can you hear me? A - Michel Khalaf Yes. Suneet, go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Okay, great. Perfect. So my first question, just on VII, I think I know the answer, but I figured I'd ask anyway. It looks like you've kept your return assumption consistent despite the economic uncertainty that you've talked about on this call. Is that just for the simplicity of being consistent with the past? Or is that at all informed by what you're hearing from your private equity partners?
Steven Goulart: Hi, Suneet. It's Steve. Thanks for the question. And this really reflects the fact that we don't want to try and predict near-term market quarterly or annual returns. This really reflects our long-term experience for the asset class and then therefore our expectation going forward. So that's why I think if you go back, it's been 12%, 3% a quarter as long as I can recall. And again, it reflects the fact that we know that - a couple of things. One is that there is volatility in the returns. But basically, our PE portfolio has generally moved directionally in line with the broad markets. If you can look at the fourth quarter, what happened, we had basically strong kind of broad market returns. NASDAQ was down a little bit. I'm sure that will reflect its way through the portfolio as well. The key, though, is despite any volatility we see in the returns on the portfolio, we're also getting very solid cash distributions. And last year, we had over - about $2.5 billion of cash distribution. As you look at the last 5 years, they've totaled $9 billion. So it really is a very reliable portfolio in that respect as well. And I think a lot of it just reflects the diversification in the portfolio. I mean we've said a number of times, we're very diversified by strategy, by manager, by vintage. Yes, LBOs and BC are the biggest part of the portfolios, but we also have significant investments in specialized strategies like special situations, energy, power and the like. So all in all, our expectations really reflect the long-term experience we've seen in the portfolio that represents the strong diversification we have.
Suneet Kamath: Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess, for John, it looks like you were able to use this Japanese reinsurance transaction to help solve for some of the uneconomic pieces of the SMR. Should we be thinking about this as another tool that you have going forward in terms of capital optimization? Or was this really just to solve that issue?
John McCallion: Good morning, Suneet. Yes, I think you've done a nice job summarizing it. It's a tool in the toolbox. We - it's not our only. We did use it to solve that situation. It was - in the fourth quarter, we executed an internal reinsurance transaction, which improved the ratio by approximately 250 points. And so - and also remember, there is two other things. One, rising rates are good for this business. So that's important to remember from an economic perspective. Second is the solvency regime is meant to be replaced in a few years time and move to a more economic solvency framework that will better reflect the economics. So this is really to deal with, I'll say, a temporary situation. And ultimately, I think these tools allow us to have no concerns over capital generation or dividend capacity.
Suneet Kamath: Okay, thanks.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question, that's from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you. Good morning. My first question, with your guidance and comments on Holdings, you guys have a pretty good handle on how LDTI will impact the income statement. Can you help give us a sense of the total impact to net from LDTI on adjusted earnings as well as on net income?
John McCallion: Good morning, Elyse. It's John. As I mentioned, I think our summary around earnings run rate is there's a few puts and takes, but net-net for the firm overall, run rate is intact for adjusted earnings. Net income will probably become, I'd say, directionally smoother than it has been. It's probably the best way to describe it and you'll probably - and you'll see that when we provide our restated QFS in kind of early April. And you'll see that there's a bit more symmetry between net income and adjusted earnings. But it's - there's still some volatility and fluctuations that you'll see. But net-net, it should be directionally better.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of PRT, can you just give us a sense of your outlook for deal volume during '23? And would you expect to see seasonality during the quarter as I think typically sometimes you've seen heavier activity to end the year?
Ramy Tadros: Elyse. So as you know, we had a record year last year with respect to PRT. And sitting here today, we're still seeing a pretty healthy pipeline given funded status of pension plans. And we're seeing that pipeline also geared towards the jumbo end of the market, which is the place where we compete the most and where we focus on. The seasonality has largely dissipated. If you looked at the timing of the deals over the last few years, we've seen less seasonality. We've seen more deals earlier on in some cases and more these later on. So I wouldn't speculate on the seasonality, but the pipeline is certainly healthy.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we do have no more time for questions. I'll turn you back to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations, for closing comments.
John Hall: Great. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-03 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will now turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's third quarter 2022 earnings call. To begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements which you should review. Presenting on the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also available to participate in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides which addressed the quarter. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features incremental disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, and it will end no later than the top of the hour. In fairness to all, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Now on to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. Many of the macroeconomic trends from the first half of the year persisted in the third quarter. As equity markets fell again, interest rates rose some more and the possibility of a recession remains in sight. Against this backdrop, we are pleased with the execution of our Next Horizon strategy which continues to prove its resilience in the face of uncertainty. Looking ahead, there are several areas that we believe differentiate MetLife and position us well going forward. We have established a track record of relentless execution focused on controlling those factors that we can control. We have built a diversified portfolio of businesses with natural offsets through organic growth, supplemented by strategic acquisitions and tactical divestments. We have a commitment to responsible growth, aided by the use of powerful analytical tools such as VNB or value of new business to produce high-teen IRRs and mid-single-digit payback periods. We have embedded an efficiency mindset in our DNA which drives our productivity and provides us with the capacity to invest in the future. And we generate strong recurring free cash flow that supports clear and consistent capital and liquidity management. Turning to quarterly performance as a whole. Recurring investment rates rose, PFOs on a constant rate basis were strong, COVID-19 losses in the aggregate moderated and expense discipline held firm. The greatest headwind was variable investment income. Starting with some numbers. Last night, we reported third quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $966 million or $1.21 per share. Notable items in the quarter included our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments which had a positive impact of $34 million or $0.04 per share on adjusted earnings. Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings in the quarter were $1.16 per share. Net income in the third quarter was $331 million compared to $1.5 billion a year ago, primarily driven by lower adjusted earnings and derivative losses from hedges we hold to protect our balance sheet as well as investment losses from standard investment activity. In the third quarter, variable investment income was a loss of $53 million. Private equity is the largest contributor to VII and generated a negative 1.3% return in the quarter. As you know, our PE portfolio is reported on a 1 quarter lag. Third quarter private equity results reflect the difficult second quarter equity market which fell 16.4% as measured by the S&P 500. Our investment in private equity is driven by its properties as a long-dated asset class that provides a good match for our long-dated liabilities. Not only has this proven to be a good ALM strategy but we have generated substantial gains over time for the benefit of our policyholders and our shareholders. As a partial offset to private equity in the quarter, we saw recurring investment income grow sequentially on higher new money rates. For roughly the past decade, we effectively managed through an interest rate environment where our new money rate was below our roll-off rate. In the second quarter, that finally reversed as our new money rate exceeded our roll-off rate. This repeated in the third quarter to even greater effect. With the duration of our investment portfolio at roughly 8 years, we expect the impact of this change to build over time. Broadly speaking, rising interest rates are a good thing for MetLife. Shifting to our business segments. We saw strong growth in U.S. Group Benefits with adjusted earnings of $399 million, up 259% year-over-year. This represents favorable underwriting, including a substantial decline in COVID-19 life insurance claims and aided by strong volume growth. Group Life mortality, including COVID-19 losses, registered a benefit ratio of 86% which continues to be at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. And our nonmedical health ratio was 70.8%, also at the low end of our annual target range of 70% to 75%. Execution across our enrollment and voluntary strategy is going well and responsible for driving double-digit PFO growth across our voluntary suite of products. The investments we've made to expand our product breadth to deepen our understanding of employee needs and to connect and communicate with employees are all paying off. In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $345 million which were down from a year ago, largely due to lower variable investment income. Benefiting from higher rates, recurring investment income spreads remained strong. The highlight in the quarter for RIS was winning our largest ever pension risk transfer deal of roughly $8 billion. Year-to-date, we have booked $12.3 billion of new PRT business, already an all-time annual high for MetLife. And we continue to see a robust pipeline with a market opportunity extending out for years. For Asia, adjusted earnings of $197 million were below a year ago, mostly on lower variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. COVID claims reduced adjusted earnings in the quarter by $129 million, driven largely by hospitalization claims in Japan. Changes to hospitalization claims eligibility rules which took effect at the end of September, will greatly reduce such claims looking ahead. Asia sales were up 27% on a constant currency basis from a year ago, led by Japan foreign currency annuities and Accident & Health products. Two weeks ago, on a visit to Asia, I had the opportunity to engage with our team and our distribution partners and bear witness to our strong execution. In this fast-changing environment, our efforts to meet our customers where they are and the nimbleness of that pursuit are strengthening our competitive advantage. In Latin America, the region had another strong quarter with adjusted earnings totaling $171 million, up significantly from COVID-impacted $29 million a year ago. Latin America sales continue to be strong, rising 22% for the quarter across the region on a constant currency basis, reflecting sustained business momentum. MetLife's focus on responsible growth is an integral element of our strategy. On an annual basis, in the third quarter, we disclosed our value of new business metrics for the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, VNB is a tool that underpins our efforts to generate responsible growth. The metrics show that MetLife has been able to put capital to work to support organic growth more effectively and efficiently over time. For example, in 2019, we deployed $3.8 billion of capital at a 15% IRR to generate $1.8 billion of VNB. 2 years later, we put less capital to work, $2.8 billion at a higher IRR to generate even more VNB, $1.9 billion. We think our principal use of VNB and the results that we've achieved are clear differentiators for MetLife. The discipline we use to evaluate and drive new business is no different than the discipline we employ to score merger and acquisition opportunities. During the third quarter, MetLife Investment Management announced a definitive agreement to acquire Affirmative Investment Management. AIM is an award-winning global environmental, social and corporate governance investment manager with roughly $1 billion of assets under management. Combining AIMs ESG capabilities with MEMS fundamental investment expertise will create differentiated client solutions and offer a new and attractive opportunity for growth. Further, this transaction underscores our strategic objective to grow our investment management business while highlighting M&A as a strategic capability for MetLife. Moving to cash and capital. MetLife continued to be active with capital management during the third quarter. We paid $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders. We also repurchased $674 million of our common shares, bringing total capital return in the quarter to roughly $1.1 billion. In October, we repurchased an additional $176 million of MetLife shares. There remains $1.6 billion outstanding on our current $3 billion authorization. MetLife is well capitalized and highly liquid. At the end of the quarter, we had $5.2 billion of cash and liquid assets at our Holdings companies. We remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. In closing, our all-weather Next Horizon strategy continues to be the right strategy to guide us through the changing times ahead. Together, the diversification of our great set of market-leading businesses, our responsible growth, our efficiency mindset and our strong free cash flow generation will serve MetLife well across a range of economic cycles. We believe these are the right ingredients to create value for our shareholders and our stakeholders now and into the future. With that, I will turn things over to John.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel and good morning. I will start with the 3Q '22 supplemental slides which provide highlights of our financial performance, details of our annual global actuarial assumption review, updates on our value of new business metrics and our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net derivative losses were primarily the result of higher interest rates. As a reminder, MetLife uses derivatives as part of our broader asset liability management strategy to hedge certain risks. This hedging activity can generate durative gains or losses and create fluctuations in net income because the risk being hedged may not have the same GAAP accounting treatment. Overall, the hedging program continues to perform as expected. In addition, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio given the rising interest rate environment. In total, the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments in 3Q of '22, was favorable to net income by $54 million, with a positive impact to adjusted earnings of $34 million and a $20 million impact to non-adjusted earnings. The table on Page 4 provides highlights of the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments with a breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business. Overall, the impacts were fairly modest. In MetLife Holdings, annuity earnings were negatively impacted by lower-than-expected lapses and annuitizations as well as model refinements. This was partially offset by favorable impact in life as a result of higher earned rates and favorable mortality. In addition, we had a reinsurance recapture gain which was favorable to RIS adjusted earnings by $91 million in the quarter. Our U.S. mean reversion interest rate remained unchanged at 2.75%. And we have maintained our long-term mortality assumptions. On Page 5, you can see the third quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment which excludes notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items was $932 million in 3Q of '22, down 58% and down 57% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline while favorable underwriting and solid volume growth were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $1.16, down 55% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 54% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. business. Group Benefits adjusted earnings more than tripled year-over-year, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 life claims as well as higher volume growth. This was partially offset by less favorable expense and investment margins year-over-year. The Group Life mortality ratio was 86% in the third quarter of '22 towards the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. The business benefited from lower U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter and a continued favorable shift in the percentage of death under age 65 which was roughly 15% in Q3 of '22. More detail on the Group Life mortality results over the past 5 quarters can be found on Page 12 in the appendix. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 70.8% in Q3 of '22 at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75% and essentially in line with the prior year quarter. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3.4% year-over-year. As we discussed in prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating life contracts in the period. The higher excess mortality in Q3 of '21 versus Q3 of '22 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts which dampened growth by roughly 1 percentage point. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 4.4% was primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings, excluding the notable in this quarter, were down 68% year-over-year. The primary driver was lower private equity return versus a very strong Q3 of '21 as well as less favorable underwriting. Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 71 basis points, well below our full year 2022 guidance of 95 to 120 basis points and prior year quarter of 256 basis points due to the significant decline in variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 101 basis points, up 8 basis points versus Q3 of '21 and down 2 basis points sequentially. While RIS liability exposures were down 1% year-over-year due to certain accounting adjustments that do not impact fees or spread income, RIS had strong volume growth driven by sales up 59% year-to-date. This was primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products. With regards to PRT, this has been a record year for MetLife as we have completed 6 transactions worth $12.3 billion year-to-date and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings ex notables were down 73% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 4% on a constant currency basis. In addition, Asia sales were up 27% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by a strong performance in Japan. Overall, Japan sales were up 33% driven by FX annuities and accident and health products which benefited from product launches and new capabilities over the past year as well as the strength of our diversified channels. Latin America adjusted earnings ex notables were $164 million versus $31 million in the prior year quarter. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. Overall, COVID-19-related deaths in Mexico were down significantly year-over-year. LATAM's recurring interest margins in 3Q '22 continued to benefit from higher inflation rates in Chile. However, this favorable impact was more than offset by lower variable investment income and the Chilean and encaje [ph] which had a negative 1.9% return in 3Q '22 versus a negative 0.3% in the prior year quarter. LATAM's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 21% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and sales were up 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region, primarily from higher single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile and group cases in Mexico. EMEA adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were down 44% and 31% on a constant currency basis compared to a strong Q3 of '21 which benefited from very favorable underwriting. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 7% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to refinements to certain unearned revenue reserves in both periods. However, sales were up 10% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 77%, excluding notable items in both periods. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. Adverse equity market impact was also a contributor as MetLife Holdings separate account return was negative 5.5% in the quarter versus a negative 1% in 3Q of '21. Favorable underwriting margins in Life and long-term care were a partial offset. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $265 million versus an adjusted loss of $131 million. The year-over-year variance was primarily due to less favorable taxes, lower variable investment income and higher expenses due to market-sensitive employee-related costs. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 23% which was at the top end of our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. On Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including a $53 million loss in the third quarter of '22. The majority of VII was attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion which had an overall negative return of 1.3% in the quarter. As we have discussed previously, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds had a positive 4.3% return in the quarter on a portfolio of roughly $2.3 billion. While VII underperformed in 3Q '22, our new money rate increased to 4.71% which was 79 basis points above our roll-off yield of 3.92%. We expect this favorable trend to continue in a rising interest rate environment. On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including a $42 million loss in Q3 of '22. RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-dated liabilities which are mostly in these 3 businesses. Turning to Page 8. This chart shows the comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 12.3% in Q3 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our third quarter expense ratio was in line with our full year target but above recent trend given higher employee-related costs that are sensitive to market fluctuations. Those costs contributed roughly 40 basis points to the ratio. While we'd expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in 4Q, consistent with the seasonality of our business, we remain committed to achieving our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.3% in 2022 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. Now, let's turn to Page 9. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past 5 years, including an update for 2021. Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. As evidence of that commitment, MetLife invested $2.8 billion of capital in 2021 to support new business which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of 6 years, generating roughly $1.9 billion in value. New business written in 2021 reflects our disciplined approach to building responsible growth while creating value, generating cash and mitigating risk. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the Holdings companies were approximately $5.2 billion at September 30 which was up from $4.5 billion at June 30 and remains well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the Holdings companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $700 million in the third quarter as well as Holdings company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, Holdco cash includes the proceeds from the $1 billion senior debt issuance in July. In regard to our statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, our preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.6 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $2.4 billion year-over-year, driven by unfavorable VA rider reserves, lower variable investment income and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.7 billion as of September 30, 2022, down 2% sequentially and year-to-date. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 617% as of June 30 which is the latest public data. The decline from March 2022 was primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates. That being said, rising interest rates improve the overall economic solvency of our Japan business. Let me conclude by saying the fundamentals of the business remain strong, solid top line growth, favorable underwriting and ongoing expense discipline. While private equity returns were down this quarter, core spreads remain robust. In addition, results in our market-leading franchises, Group Benefits and Latin America continue their strong growth and recovery. Finally, our commitment to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth positions MetLife to build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: So first, I had a question just on your new money yield. If you could talk about where it stands with the recent rise in rates? And how it compares to the yield on your maturing investments?
Steven Goulart: Jimmy, it's Steve Goulart. Thanks for the question. And I think John gave some details and color on it but our new money yield rose again this past quarter. 471 was the actual number and that shows continued improvement. I think a reflection of what we're seeing in the market, obviously, with interest rates rising. And so we're very pleased with what it means for our general account investing. We're obviously going to continue to see the portfolio yield rise as a result of that given that our roll-off has been now for the last couple of quarters also lower than our new money rates. I would also just remind everybody, though, that things can be a little bit volatile quarter-to-quarter, just looking at the existing book of assets that we have, with the roll-off of maturity characteristics of those are. This was -- we look and see some big blocks that rolled off this past quarter and there'll be things like that in the future as well. But I think what's important is to think about what the trend is. The trend is positive. We continue to see and expect our new money yield to increase and continue to expect to see widening spread over the existing portfolio and that's obviously positive for net investment income.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And as the new money yield is going up, how much are you having to raise crediting rates or improved terms and conditions on the interest-sensitive products that I noticed in the retirement business, the yield was up a decent amount but crediting rates were up even, I think, sequentially even a little bit more. So this spread ended up declining sequentially ex-VII.
Ramy Tadros: Jimmy, it's Ramy Tadros here. If you look at our in-force for RIS, the vast majority of our in-force from a crediting grade perspective is fixed. You may see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in terms of the crediting grid. And clearly, the new business we're writing, while we're running at attractive spreads, it has a higher crediting rate given the market environment. But there is no really increases or pressure on our in-force because that's mostly fixed.
Jimmy Bhullar: Yes. And then just lastly, on Group Benefits, your margins were pretty good, I think, across all products and other companies have reported similar results as well. Are you seeing any signs of competition in the market picking up given the strong results that companies have had in the Group Benefits market over the past few quarters?
Ramy Tadros: Thanks, Jimmy. It's Ramy again. So I'll give a specific answer to your question. It may be also helpful to give you some broader context. Both our mortality ratio as well as our nonmedical health ratio were clearly favorable in the quarter. But if you look at our results, historically, there's some seasonality to both of those ratios and we'd expect them to somewhat pick up in the fourth quarter just from a seasonality perspective. In terms of the overall market, we remain extremely bullish about this market. And if you were to kind of step back more broadly, you've all heard about the workplace dynamics and how those are changing where we're seeing employees expecting more from their employers and we're seeing employers looking for a variety of levers to attract, retain and engage their talent. And so that's a secular trend that's here to stay and that's providing kind of tailwinds for the entire market. From a competitive perspective, I would say overall pricing is competitive but is also rational. We've talked about this in the past, the short nature of these products, Jimmy, really act as a natural check on any sustained irrational pricing. And the other piece of this market that we kind of like is that you can also differentiate on many factors beyond price such as service and digital experiences to name a few. So some of these things, we believe, are going to provide kind of tailwinds to the overall market and keep the competitive landscape rationale. Now all of these are germane to the entire Group Benefits industry. They're particularly pertinent for us because we are the market leader in this industry across both our core and voluntary products. And that leadership and the strategic focus we've had is really giving us the scale to invest in a broad range of capabilities that we have that allows us to differentiate our offerings. So overall, really pleased with the performance, really pleased with the persistency and continue to see a competitive but rational market here.
Operator: Next, we move on to Ryan Krueger with KBW.
Ryan Krueger: First question was the $1 billion of debt that you issued in the quarter. Is there anything that, that's earmarked for? Or is that fully available to use?
John McCallion: Ryan, it's John. So as you said, we issued $1 billion of debt back in July. We got some great terms on that and great execution. It's generally used -- it's generally raised for general purposes as well as we do have a maturity coming up in 2023. I think at the present time, we're maintaining flexibility and we'll see how things progress over the next few months. But all in all, we're pretty pleased with our holdco cash and cash flows generally.
Ryan Krueger: Got it. And then I just had a question on Japan, just given the big moves in FX and rates there. I guess is that -- do you view the SMR becoming less relevant in this environment and there's more emerging focus on the ESR in Japan? Or could there be a situation where the SMR becomes a negating factor to sending cash out of Japan?
John McCallion: Yes, thanks. It's John, again. I'll take that. So as you said, the SMR was down in the second quarter at 6 17 and certainly in the current regime, rising interest rates do impact that. But overall, as you mentioned and I said in my opening remarks, rising interest rates improve the overall economic value of that business. We'll have to monitor the SMR. We can't ignore it but we want to also do things that make sense. And we have a number of internal tools that we can utilize to help manage that temporary impact you would see in the SMR because of the asymmetrical accounting. So overall, the economics is improving, as you mentioned, in a few years' time. They're moving to a more economic solvency framework known as ESR that will better reflect the economics of the business. And right now, we have no concerns over the capital generation or dividend capacity of the business or overall free cash flow for the firm.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.
Tom Gallagher: Just a couple of questions on one on derivatives, second on investment losses. Just on -- as I think about your hedges and I just look at derivative losses from rising interest rates, I just want to understand if there's any real impact to statutory capital generation from that. I look at the last 3 quarters, they've been about $2 billion or more than $2 billion of losses. I didn't think that impacted stat earnings, I thought that was an adjustment to TAC. But just first question is just any impact that should have on stack capital generation?
John McCallion: And just to clarify, the $2 billion you're referencing is a GAAP number, right?
Tom Gallagher: Yes. It's in your QFS, not -- and I don't see that showing up in the -- the intact, right?
John McCallion: That's right. Yes. And I think that's the correct observation. Obviously, there's different accounting that occurs in GAAP versus stat. I think the punch line that I would just leave you with is overall, we actively manage the statutory capital of the operating entities. And as you've seen, there's been a rising rate environment. And I'd say CAC has been very resilient despite the market fluctuations. That's probably how I'd leave it.
Tom Gallagher: Okay. So John, no real impact that you see right now on dividend capacity or capital generation that would be notable to point out?
John McCallion: No.
Tom Gallagher: Okay. And then my follow-up is, just on the investment losses and gains in your supplement, I just want to understand how to think about whether those loss could have an impact on stack capital generation as well? I think most of those should be flowing through IMR. So to the extent that you have net losses, I think that will reduce amortization gains every year but it will have a very like modest annual impact. Am I thinking about that correctly? Or can you shed some light on that?
Steven Goulart: Tom, it's Steve Goulart. I think John and I will tag team on this a little bit. But just in thinking about what's happening in the market and trading and losses and the like. First thing I'd say is losses are not unexpected in this environment, just given rising rates. Although I would note that they're down significantly from where they were last quarter which I think shows sort of a more moderating environment in that respect. And again, like I said last quarter, it's usually pretty easy to decipher understand why we're taking losses. It's a combination of rotating temporary assets into permanent assets and things like PRTs and other longer-term liabilities. And also just funding outflows and cash flow needs of the different businesses, whether it be surrenders or capital markets and the like. So that sort of sets the stage. Again, down from last quarter as we would expect. And obviously, this is something though that we do manage and John can talk a little bit about the capital impacts.
John McCallion: Yes. And you're correct, Tom, if you have an IMR balance, would typically get absorbed, we're in that position today. But it's one you have to actively monitor and manage and we plan to do so.
Operator: Our next question is from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.
Erik Bass: You highlighted the strong PRT sales year-to-date in a robust pipeline. I was just hoping you could talk about how the rise in interest rates is affecting both plan sponsor demand for risk transfer as well as pricing for transactions? And also in the past, I think you've given a rule of thumb for the earnings contribution from each $1 billion of sales. I'm just wondering if this is still the right level to think about?
Ramy Tadros: Eric, it's Ramy here. I'll answer the second question first. Yes, that's still the rule of thumb still holds and that's how you should think about the earnings run rate of these deals. With respect to the overall PRT market, clearly, I think the headline number to look at is the overall funding level which is going to be helped by rising interest rates and therefore, improve if you fill the affordability and the funding levels of defined benefit plans to engage in any kind of pension risk transfer. Clearly, we've seen -- we're on track to have a record year this year. With respect to PRT, we're extremely pleased with winning our largest deal ever with IBM. And we still see a very robust pipeline in front of us. I mean, we are the market leader here. We have deep experience working with plan sponsors and their advisers on all aspects of pension risk transfers. And we have a very clear strategy in this market. We're focused on the jumbo end of the market. That placed our competitive strengths in terms of our rating, the size of our balance sheet, our investment capabilities and you see large sponsors like IBM are looking for solution providers with a very long track record of being in this business. I'd also note that the jumbo end of the market is the part of the market where the competitive set of providers tends to be somewhat smaller given all the other attributes I've talked about. And the last thing I would point on this market, while we are a market leader and actively engaged, we always have our eye on value and value of new business. Going back to the chart that Michel and John referenced and we want the write business and we are writing business which with ROEs that are well within our enterprise ROE targets.
Erik Bass: And then, I was hoping you could talk about the growth outlook for the Latin American business. There's been strong sales momentum and you're back to the earnings run rate that you had talked about. So looking forward, is double-digit growth in PFOs and earnings from here, kind of the right target to think about?
Eric Clurfain: Yes. Thanks, Erik. This is Eric. So Yes. Overall, we had another solid quarter for the region, supported by what you know is the strength of our franchise, our strong underlying business fundamentals. All of it combined with a market factors and tailwinds last quarter and this quarter. Now we continue to deliver on our growth commitments as evidenced and as you mentioned, by a double-digit growth in PFOs that are reflective both of our strong sales and solid persistencies and good momentum that we're continuing to see across all countries. Now the sales momentum that began really last year has continued throughout this year. It is reflective of the resilience of our distribution channel, the diversification and the diversified product mix and the overall solidity and growth potential of the franchise in the region. Now the sales quarter -- the strong sales quarter was really across the region and across all channels with Chile and Brazil having the record quarter. Brazil actually I want to point out this is a growth story. We have grown twice as fast as the market. We are growing very well across all channels and all products. And just to give you an idea, this quarter, Brazil contributed to over 20% of the region's sales. So that overall flight to quality that I referenced last quarter is also evidenced by the strong persistencies that we're continuing to see and the robust sales of year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So overall, we don't update our outlook and we'll do so in February but we're very pleased with the momentum and the growth that we're seeing across the region.
Operator: And our next question is from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Scott: First question I had a few on expenses. I know you guys have guided to this direct expense ratio. But I also recognize you've been getting pretty good growth across a number of your businesses. So I just wanted to better understand the kind of operating leverage that you expect to get over time?
Michel Khalaf: Alex, it's Michel. So let me just maybe remind why we anchored on the 12 3 and we talked about building an efficiency mindset as part of our DNA and we're seeing excellent traction on this front. And the idea here is that we wanted to -- we want to continue to free up capacity to make important investments in our business. And we've been able to do so over the last few years and I think this is playing out very nicely. If you think about, I referenced voluntary benefits and some of the capabilities that we've introduced there, Japan in terms of digitizing our business and speed to market in terms of introducing new products. So we believe it's important to continue to make those types of investments to drive our competitive advantage going forward. Now when we did sort of establish the 12 3 target, obviously, it was also in a different environment if you consider the inflationary pressures that everyone is feeling at the moment. Yet, I mean -- and again, I think this is credit to the sort of efficiency mindset that we've built here. We continue to be committed to achieving 12 3 for the year. And the last thing I would point to is that whereas we're having a record year when it comes to PRT, over $12 billion in new PRT deals, PRT premiums does not factor into our direct expense ratio, does not sort of help us from that standpoint yet. There are obviously expenses associated with winning this business. So for all those reasons, we continue to believe that 12 3 is the right target for us.
Alex Scott: Got it. That's really helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the capital deployment and the value of new business disclosure you all gave. You show in that disclosure that the margins that you're making on new business are seemingly getting materially better. Does it make sense to deploy more capital? I mean I noticed you deployed a little bit less at better margins. Does it make sense to ramp that up as we think about 2023 and how much you'll deploy behind new business?
John McCallion: Alex, it's John. Yes, it's a great point. I mean we are focused on achieving solid returns and deploying capital to its highest and best use and ultimately creating value, right? Value is the important number there. And while the IRR and the payback is also -- we don't want to just get focused on 1 metric, the reality is that when we can deploy a great amount of capital to improve value that we're comfortable with, we're going to do it. And I think that it's a great call out I think that you've made. It's not -- we're not just focused on reducing the amount we deploy. We want to deploy more at very attractive returns. And I think that will fluctuate. I mean you can see, I would say, a transition that has happened over time and that's the trend you're seeing. We're at a great point right now where I think to the extent we can deploy even more capital at attractive returns, we're going to do it.
Operator: And our next question is from Suneet Kamath with Jefferies.
Suneet Kamath: Just going back to PRT for a second. I just wanted to think through the capital needs as you think about growth in that business. It didn't look like you needed to infuse any capital to support IBM. So I just want to confirm that. But also, as you think about the pipeline, is the opportunity set that you see in front of you going to require more capital? Or is that business sort of self-funding at this point?
John McCallion: Suneet, this is John. I'll maybe just take it at a high level and maybe touch on -- I referenced in my opening remarks a slight decline in STACK capital. If you think about that, it was about 2%. Part of that -- most of that I'd say was attributable to the large deal we did in the third quarter and the related capital strain, offset by some capital generation as well as we also updated some of our latest estimates on the net positive impact from the C2 updates around mortality and morbidity. So net-net, I think overall, we've been able to self-fund our record years to date. Now your question on the outlook. I think everything is dependent. I mean, volume is a dependent factor in answering that question. But right now, we feel very comfortable with being able to fund within the operating entities, what's needed to successfully grow this business.
Suneet Kamath: Okay, got it. And then I guess for Steve, on VII, any thoughts on kind of fourth quarter? And then also as we think about longer term, given kind of higher rates in volatile markets, any change to kind of the longer-term thought around what the returns of this portfolio could be?
Steven Goulart: I'd say probably several points just thinking about VII and specifically, the alternatives portfolio. First is just remember our guidance. We've been very consistent for several years in that. 12% is our expectation every year when we're going to planning, 3% a quarter. And I'd say that even now looking forward to the last part of your question, I wouldn't anticipate that changing. That's just how we think about this portfolio. The second thing is really our experience. And we've talked a lot about this, too, where in general, one of the things that we've always found attractive about the alternatives portfolio is that it does give us equity-like returns but it gives it to us with less volatility and less extremes as compared to some other public market alternatives would. So that's why it's been very attractive to us. Now, we did -- we talked a little bit several quarters over the last couple of years where we saw that relationship be challenged. But when we look at the last couple of quarters, we do think that we're turning to sort of the historical norm in our expectations which is, again, more muted in terms of volatility and extremes but still giving us very attractive returns. So I don't think our outlook would change for it now but we continue to like it for the reasons that we've mentioned.
Operator: Next, we have a question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question, I know you guys are typically asked just about potential transaction within your blocks within Holdings. Anything new there or any changes that you've seen within the bid-ask spread within the market in the quarter?
John McCallion: Elyse, nothing new to update here. It's still an active market out there. There is still an active set of participants. We continue to focus on optimizing holdings, both from an internal perspective as well as speaking with external participants on opportunities. And as we have been for quite some time. And it's a potential opportunity but it's not one where we feel like we have to do anything and we're being thoughtful about seeing if there is a opportunity one way or the other. So -- but nothing new at this point.
Elyse Greenspan: And then on the RIS on the core spread ex-VII, anything within that number? And how should we kind of think about that trending from here?
John McCallion: Elyse, it's John again. As you said, total spreads were at 71, ex-VII came in at 101. So year-over-year, up 8 basis points on an ex-VII basis and then down sequentially. Year-over-year, it's -- obviously, the higher interest rates have been beneficial. We have more of these interest rate caps that are in the money that are starting to kind of add to the spread. Sequentially, it was down 2 basis points. In the second quarter, I called out that there were some excess returns in real estate that we expected to moderate they did. So, I'd say third quarter came in pretty much as expected. And then I think the thing going forward here is certainly based on the forward curve which I just pulled up this morning of 3-month LIBOR which is expected to rise to above 5% in the end of the year and beyond into next year. These caps will still be in place and will be additive to the spread. I'd say for fourth quarter, we'd expect spreads all else equal to grow by 5-plus bps.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Wilma Burtis with Raymond James.
Wilma Burdis: [Indiscernible] previously guided to $650 million, $750 million of corporate costs for 2022. It sounds like you're sticking to the 12.3% expense guidance but should we expect a higher run rate in corporate heading into 2023, given PFO growth and inflation?
John McCallion: Wilma, this is John. Good question. I think a couple of things to point out in terms of just third quarter. First, in the first and third quarter, we typically have higher preferred stock dividends by about $30 million. Second, we are running a little heavier on interest costs on debt just because of the $1 billion of debt we raised in July. I think third item is PE returns have been down the last couple of quarters. And then lastly, I called out in my opening remarks that we do get -- we have seen over the last couple of quarters some higher market-sensitive employee-related costs or corporate costs that we referred to. And actually, that probably hit us by about 40 basis points on the expense ratio this quarter. So we are running a little heavy, as Michel commented before, we still expect to meet the 12.3% target despite this. And then I think we'll talk about outlook as we get into our February call. So hopefully, that helps.
Wilma Burdis: Okay. Second question, you've previously guided to a roughly $65 million quarterly earnings run rate in EMEA. But it seems like $56 million this quarter was fairly normal. So I'm wondering if that's a good run rate reflecting currency pressures.?
John McCallion: Yes. I think that's a pretty simple way of thinking about it, one, you're on. I mean, the currency has basically brought down that run rate over the last couple of quarters. So I think you're right that probably the new number is probably closer to that.
Operator: And that's all the time we have available for questions. And we will now pass the call back to MetLife's CEO, Michel Khalaf for closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you all for joining us this morning. When we rolled out our future work model in March, we did so grounded in the belief that the office plays an important role in how we live our purpose. I've now had the opportunity to visit our major offices in the U.S. and internationally. The vibrancy, energy and focus I encountered was palpable and speaks to the cultural evolution underpinning our Next Horizon strategy. More evidence of this emerged in our annual global employee survey, where participation rates and engagement scores reached their highest levels ever. MetLife is a team sport. These levels of energy and engagement give us further confidence in our ability to relentlessly execute on our strategy and deliver long-term value to our stakeholders. Thanks again and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-04 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to the risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings.  With that, I will now turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review.  On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along.  An appendix to these slides feature incremental disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which will end no later than the top of the hour. In fairness to all, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Now over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Over time, I have referred to our Next Horizon strategy as being all weather designed to guide MetLife through a variety of economic environments. And the environment has shifted with equity markets falling from historic highs, interest rates trending up from historic lows, further strengthening of the dollar and the odds of a U.S. recession on the rise.  The resilience of Next Horizon, combined with our clarity of purpose, positioned MetLife to meet these challenges in the second quarter of 2022. While certain things may be outside our control, we continue to execute with urgency across those things we do control. Let's turn to some numbers. MetLife reported strong financial results for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion or $2 per share compared to $2.37 per share a year ago. Excluding one notable item, adjusted earnings were $1.90 per share.  The combination of strong underwriting margins and good volume growth drove solid adjusted earnings results while variable investment income fell below our quarterly outlook expectations. Net income in the second quarter was $103 million compared to $3.4 billion a year ago. Current period net income was driven by adjusted earnings, offset by interest rate and foreign currency derivative losses from securities held to protect our balance sheet.  Also, standard investment activity resulted in realized losses as interest rates rose during the quarter. Year ago net income includes the gain we booked on the successful sale of our Auto & Home business. Now moving to variable investment income, which returned to a more typical level following 7 consecutive quarters of truly outstanding results. During the 7-quarter period, MetLife generated more than $8 billion of cumulative pretax variable investment income. This type of investment performance serves to validate MetLife's long-term prudent exposure to this value-added asset class.  In the second quarter, variable investment income of $389 million was aided by private equity investments and real estate funds, which generated returns of 1.5% and 7.9%, respectively. Our private equity returns are reported on a 1-quarter lag and the weak second quarter equity market should negatively impact our variable investment income in the third quarter.  Throughout the pandemic, the broad diversity of MetLife's businesses across product lines and geographies has clearly been a great strength. Initially, underwriting gains in one business offset underwriting losses elsewhere. When COVID claims seem to reach their peak, our private equity gains then filled the gap. And the current quarter continues to illustrate this point as variable investment income has returned to more normal levels in the second quarter, so too have our underwriting margins.  Turning to MetLife's business performance. I'll start with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings of $400 million were up 61% year-over-year. This represents the highest quarterly result ever posted by this flagship business, primarily driven by favorable underwriting. Historically, the second quarter tends to be a low mortality quarter, something that was also evident this year.  Group Life mortality, including COVID-19 losses, registered a benefit ratio of 85.8%, which is at the low end of our target range of 85% to 90%. A significant contraction in U.S. COVID-related deaths and a further shift upward in the age of death contributed to the improvement in the second quarter benefit ratio. Having witnessed prior [indiscernible] during this 2.5-year long pandemic, we are cautiously optimistic and note the absence of much, if any, excess mortality in our current period group benefits results.  At the current pace, MetLife is on track to generate close to $25 billion of adjusted group benefit revenue in 2022, a true testament to our product breadth, scale and momentum in this attractive market-leading business. For Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $388 million, which were down from a year ago due to less variable investment income, but helped by favorable volume growth. Looking past the decline in variable investment income, recurring investment income spreads were strong at 103 basis points as we continue to manage against a shifting yield curve.  During the quarter, we booked $2.6 billion of new pension risk transfer business, which brings our year-to-date total to roughly $4 billion. We continue to see a strong pipeline for the balance of the year based on good funding levels and higher long-term interest rates. In Asia, adjusted earnings of $386 million were below a year ago on lower variable investment income and less favorable underwriting.  COVID claims in Japan impacted adjusted earnings in the quarter, driven largely by deemed hospitalization, which allows for payment of COVID claims incurred for care outside of the hospital. Other Asia business metrics remained favorable, with sales growing 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, while general account AUMs in the region were up 5% on the same basis.  In Japan, sales grew 5% on a constant currency basis. MetLife has a history of product innovation in Japan. Most recently, we've built on that legacy with product launches in September, February and April, illustrating both our speed to market for new products and our leading digital distribution capabilities. We continue to have good sales momentum in Japan, supported by a resilient business model and we remain on track to achieve our Asia region sales outlook for the year.  Looking to Latin America, adjusted earnings totaled $267 million, well above $97 million a year ago. Lower COVID claims, a favorable impact from inflation, a strong encaje and continued volume growth, all combined to generate substantial outperformance in the second quarter. Fundamental drivers in Latin America also remains strong with sales and PFOs up from a year ago on a constant currency basis by 19% and 26%, respectively.  Moving to capital and cash. MetLife was active with capital management during the second quarter, and we returned more than $1.5 billion to shareholders through $408 million of common dividends and $1.1 billion of share repurchase. In the first half of 2022, MetLife repurchased approximately $2 billion of common stock. Given the accelerated pace of buyback activity in the first half of the year, we anticipate a modestly slower pace in the back half.  There remains $2.5 billion outstanding on our current $3 billion authorization. MetLife continues to be well capitalized and highly liquid. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which includes the proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, and we remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion.  Financial flexibility was further enhanced after the second quarter's end when we tapped the debt market raising $1 billion of 30-year paper and a well oversubscribed offering, another example of the value the market attributes to MetLife's financial strength. Turning to sustainability. At the end of last quarter, MetLife announced a broad set of DEI commitments designed to address the needs of the underserved and underrepresented by 2030.  The MetLife Foundation recently announced an updated strategy aimed at driving inclusive economic mobility by addressing the needs of underserved and underrepresented communities around the globe. The foundation's grant-making and impact investments will be aligned across 3 core portfolios: Economic inclusion, financial health and resilient communities and will advance the broad set of diversity, equity and inclusion commitment MetLife announced at the end of last quarter.  In closing, when we introduced our Next horizon strategy, little did we know that it would be put to the test so quickly and so severely. Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate its resilience. We saw solid underlying business performance, supported by a strong capital base, which reinforces our confidence that Next Horizon is the right strategy for MetLife. With our purpose as our North Star and with our strategic pillars to guide us along the way, MetLife is well positioned to rise to the challenges ahead and deliver significant long-term value to our shareholders and other stakeholders.  With that, I will turn things over to John.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions as well as commentary on the new U.S. GAAP accounting known as Long Duration Targeted Improvements or LDTI, effective 1/1/23.  Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Higher interest rates and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter drove net derivative losses. As a reminder, MetLife uses derivatives as part of our broader asset liability management strategy to hedge certain risks. This hedging activity often generates derivative gains or losses and creates fluctuations in net income because the risk being hedged may not have the same GAAP accounting treatment.  In addition, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio given the rising interest rate environment. We had one favorable notable item this quarter of $77 million or $0.09 per share related to a reinsurance settlement, which was accounted for in MetLife Holdings.  On Page 4, you can see the second quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which excludes notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings in the second quarter of 2022, excluding the notable item were $1.5 billion, down 23% and down 21% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline, while favorable underwriting and solid volume growth were partial offsets.  Adjusted earnings per share, excluding the notable item, was $1.90, down 17% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 15% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. business. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 61% year-over-year, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 Life claims as well as higher volume growth.  The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.8% in the second quarter of '22 towards the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. The business benefited from lower U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter and a continued favorable shift in the percentage of death under age 65, declining from approximately 23% in the first quarter to roughly 17% in the second quarter.  The adjusted earnings impact of Group Life COVID-19 reported claims was approximately $35 million offset in part by an IBNR release related to 1Q '22 COVID-19 claims of approximately $25 million. Therefore, the net COVID impact was roughly $10 million or one percentage point on the Group Life mortality ratio. More detail on the Group Life mortality results over the past 5 quarters can be found on Page 11 in the appendix.  Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 73.1% in Q2 of '22 within its annual target range of 70% to 75% and favorable to the prior year quarter of 73.8%. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3% year-over-year. As we discussed in the prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating contracts in the period.  The higher excess mortality in Q2 of '21 versus Q2 of '22 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 1.5 percentage points. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 4.5% was due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 41% year-over-year. The primary driver was less favorable private equity returns versus a very strong Q2 of '21.  Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 116 basis points within our full year 2022 guidance of 95 to 120 basis points, but well below the prior year quarter of 224 basis points due to the significant decline in variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 103 basis points, up 5 basis points versus Q2 of '21 and up 14 basis points sequentially due to higher interest rates, wider credit spreads and favorable real estate performance.  RIS liability exposures were down 3% year-over-year despite strong top line growth. The key drivers of this decrease came from reductions in accounting adjustments that impact our liabilities, but do not impact fees or spread income and thus have no impact on adjusted earnings. RIS sales were up 30% year-to-date, primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products.  With regards to PRT, we completed 3 transactions worth $2.6 billion in the quarter, a strong first half of 2022, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. adjusted earnings were down 26% and 22% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 5% on a constant currency basis.  In addition, Asia sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by another solid performance in Japan. Overall, Japan sales were up 5% driven by FX annuities and accident and health products sold through face-to-face channels. Latin America adjusted earnings were $267 million versus $97 million in the prior year quarter. This strong performance were driven by several positive factors, primarily favorable underwriting and investment margins as well as solid volume growth.  Overall, COVID-19 related deaths in Mexico were down significantly in Q2. This positive trend, coupled with the emergence of even more favorable mortality experience in our own block, resulted in a reduction to the IBNR reserve that was established in prior periods. This benefited LatAm's adjusted earnings by roughly $40 million after tax in 2Q '22. The LatAm's adjusted earnings in the quarter also benefited from strong investment margins, primarily due to the net impact from inflation-linked assets and liabilities in Chile that increased with higher inflation rates as well as the Chilean encaje, which had a 4.8% return in 2Q '22 versus a negative 1.5% in the prior year quarter.  LATAM's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 26% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region, primarily from higher single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile and group cases in Mexico. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 32% and 16% on a constant currency basis compared to a strong Q2 of '21, which benefited from a favorable refinement of an unearned premium reserve in the prior year period, totaling approximately $15 million after tax.  In addition, adverse equity market impacts in the current year period were partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 46%, excluding the favorable notable item of $77 million after tax as discussed earlier. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income, adverse equity market impacts and less favorable underwriting also were contributors to the year-over-year decline.  MetLife Holdings separate account return was negative 14% in the quarter versus a positive 6% in Q2 of '21. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $243 million versus an adjusted loss of $126 million, excluding notables in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year variance was primarily due to higher expenses from corporate-related costs associated with less favorable equity markets and higher interest rates. Higher taxes and lower variable investment income were also contributors.  The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 22.3% and within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including $389 million in the second quarter of '22. The majority of VII was attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall return of 1.5% in the quarter.  As we have previously discussed, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds were also a strong contributor to VII with nearly an 8% return in the quarter while hedge funds, which are reported on a 1-month lag, had a loss.  While VII in 2Q '22 was below expectation and recent trends, our new money rate was 3.92% and above our roll-off yield of 3.71%. This marks the first time in over a decade in which we did not experience quarterly spread compression in the investment portfolio. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including $307 million in Q2 of '22.  Asia, MetLife Holdings and RIS continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-date liabilities, which are mostly in these 3 businesses.  Turning to Page 7. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 11.9% in Q2 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our second quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline.  While we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in the second half of the year, consistent with the seasonality of our business, we remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3% in 2022 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset.  I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at June 30, which is up from $4.2 billion at March 31 and remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $1.1 billion in the second quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows.  In addition, holdco cash includes the proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April. In regard to our statutory capital for our U.S. companies, our preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $700 million, while net income was approximately $1.3 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $2 billion year-over-year, driven by unfavorable VA rider reserves, underwriting results and lower variable investment income.  We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.1 billion as of June 30, 2022, up 2% sequentially. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 764% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. The decline from December 2021 was primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates.  Now shifting to LDTI on Page 9. While there is quite a bit of work still to be done prior to implementation on January 1, let me take a moment to recognize the great work of our MetLife associates and our partners in getting us to this point. This slide provides an update on our expected transition balances as of January 1, 2021, under LDTI. The column on the left was our actual balances at 12/31/'20, and the middle column contains the estimated range of our restated balances under LDTI.  The changes under LDTI that account for the bulk of the book value adjustment at transition include the market risk benefit adjustment associated with variable annuities, not presently accounted for at market, the impact of disaggregation and the revaluation of in-scope long-duration insurance contracts using a [indiscernible] equivalent discount rate and the elimination of relevant shadow account balances.  As you can see from MetLife at the end of 2020, there is a greater convergence between book value and book value excluding AOCI under LDTI. However, this may not always be the case as certain assets are not mark-to-market and not all liabilities are in scope under LDTI. While LDTI will provide additional information and transparency and improve consistency around accounting for certain aspects of the life insurance industry, it does not impact cumulative product profitability, cash flow generation, our strategy or how we manage the business.  Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities that allow us to navigate successfully through uncertain environments. While private equity returns were lower this quarter, it was offset by favorable underwriting, most notably in our market-leading franchises in Group Benefits and Mexico, which saw a return to more normal mortality as COVID-19 deaths significantly declined.  Finally, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. And we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW.
Ryan Krueger: First question was, thanks for the LDTI disclosure on the balance sheet. I guess, at this point, are you able to give any sense, I guess, directionally on the potential impact to ongoing earnings?
John McCallion: Ryan, it's John. We're still working through that. And I think our plan would be to discuss more details at a later date. But I think the general point, I would probably leave you with is that we don't expect major differences in the core underlying earnings, but there are sources of differences when actuals emerge, right?  So how actual experience may deviate from expectation, gets treated one way in current GAAP versus under LDTI, and then there's a number of different aspects. But I think all in all, we would expect kind of core earnings. Maybe I'll just give you a little color, too. I think this is probably a good perspective as to why that would be the case.  So it does not affect all of our segments, right? If you think about group minimal impact, vast majority, not subject to it given it's a short duration product. We go through RIS and it's mainly a spread business. We would expect spread calcs to look similar.  As you move into MLH, not all products are impacted, right? We have a number of [indiscernible] FAS 97 products, universal life fixed annuities. Also the participating business is not subject to LDTI. And if we took kind of an early look at that and kind of assume that we would implement this the beginning of this year, we probably would have given you the same range of guidance that we would have otherwise given back in February. And then Asia is probably the other one that's somewhat sizable. Again, there's a lot of FAS 97 products there. Japan, if you think about our flagship products in FX, they're all under FAS 97 versus FAS 60. And then EMEA and LatAm are much more modest. So hopefully, that kind of just gives you color as to why kind of give you that general statement.
Ryan Krueger: Yes. No, that's very helpful. And then on VII, obviously, acknowledging how strong it's been over the last couple of years. But can you give any sense of what it could look like in the third quarter?
Steven Goulart: Ryan, it's Steve Goulart. I think -- I guess I'd start with just reminding everybody sort of the slide that John used, which is what's our guidance. Our guidance is really just a generic assumption of 12% a year, 3% a quarter. We all know, of course, there's a one quarter lag in it too. And when we look at broad market returns in the second quarter, we know that they were basically negative in the teens.  But I think what we've proven over time through the diversification in our portfolio across strategies and geographies is we would expect that directionally but likely not to the same degree as a market overall. So I think that's probably all we'd really say at this point.
Operator: And our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jamminder Bhullar: So first, I had a question on the retirement business in terms of spreads. I think they expanded about 14 basis points sequentially. And I think you had been cautioning that they might actually decline or certainly weren't expecting much of an improvement. So wondering how much of the improvement has to do with interest rate caps or other types of sort of hedging activities? And do you expect this to be a good base for spread going forward? Or should we think about the 1Q level and adjust off of that looking forward?
John McCallion: Jimmy, it's John. As you point out, we had a pretty resilient level of spreads this quarter, up 14 basis points sequentially. And as you point out, we did not quite expect that back in the Q1 call. But that was -- we were basing our commentary based on forward rate curve, right? And if you think about what has happened since the 10-year treasury ends up about 65 basis points above that. And the other thing that happened is spreads widened. So our reinvestments were strong. And then the third thing is 3-month LIBOR jumped to a much greater level than we had expected and actually the forward curve expected ended the quarter at roughly 2.3%.  If I think about just during the course of the quarter, it was kind of hovering around 150 and then all of a sudden, there was a huge spike kind of at the end of May into June. And bypassing that [indiscernible], I referenced this 2% marker. As LIBOR started to grow, get towards that 2% and then beyond, it could create a little bit of a tailwind. We have a number of caps that start to become in the money. That we have in place today.  And so that was really the main driver moving us from a headwind of LIBOR rising to a, if you call it, I guess, a benefit of having the caps be in the money. So that was the real driver. The other thing I'd point out is real estate equity outperformed. So within our core investment income, real estate equity was stronger than expected. We'd expect that to moderate.  But if we look forward, and I guess, assuming today's current forward rates, which we know can be different, we'd expect ex-VII spreads to remain pretty close to where we are today, I mean, give or take, plus or minus, and even assuming some moderation of the real estate returns.
Jamminder Bhullar: And then sales...
John McCallion: Sorry, Jimmy just let me just add. I would just tell you that, that's probably for the next couple of quarters, right? I mean we'll give guidance for next year when we get towards the latter part of the year.
Jamminder Bhullar: And then obviously, the changes in new money yields and those affect that as well, obviously, modestly, but they do have a an effect.
John McCallion: Yes, you're right. Yes.
Jamminder Bhullar: And on sales in the Asia business outside of Japan were down. And I think you had mentioned previously that in Korea, it was because of a lot of your salespeople getting COVID and COVID cases still being high. And then I think in China, with the mobility restrictions, that's hurting sales, is it more -- are the sales down more because of those types of factors in 2Q as well? Or is there anything else going on in the underlying market that could sustain even beyond COVID.
Unidentified Company Representative: Jimmy, it's Lindon here. So let me give you the color on total Asia sales, and then I'll get into the other markets as well. we have good diversification across all the markets, products and channels, and that really drives very consistent execution through this market conditions.  So overall, we've had positive growth in the second quarter, led by strong performance in Japan. If we look a little bit at Japan sales, we're up 5%. And that's actually driven by 3 factors. First, the execution on the ground of the team has been very strong. We have a very diversified distribution channels, and the products and capabilities we've launched in the past year has really helped us drive the growth over there.  But as you pointed out in Other Asia, we've faced a couple of headwinds. We've got COVID restrictions going on in China right now, and the stronger U.S. dollar has really impacted sales for the FX products in Korea. But despite these channels, we actually have other markets that are compensating for these and help offset some of these headwinds.  Looking forward, we expect strong momentum going into the third quarter. We're introducing new products in Korea. And also, we expect some relief in the lockdown conditions in China. So full year basis, we are comfortable with the guidance of mid-single year digit growth that we gave at the outlook call.
Operator: And next, we go to Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.
Thomas Gallagher: I had two capital questions. The first is the new C2 factor change that's coming year-end for mortality, morbidity. My understanding is it positively impacts Group Life, negatively affects Individual Life. If so, is that a positive for Met? And if so, could you quantify it?
Ramy Tadros: Tom, it's Ramy here. I would say it's overall neutral. I mean we have been looking at our business and pricing it in anticipation of changes to the C2 factors, and there's a fair bit of diversification calculation in that number. So I would say very small and neutral in terms of its impact.
Thomas Gallagher: Okay. And the SMR change in Japan dropped a lot in March, I assume that's going to go down a lot more in June just based on where rates went. How are you thinking about managing through that? Or are you contemplating hedging this at all? And also, is there a risk that, that can impact the dividend remittances out of Japan.
John McCallion: Tom, it's John. As you point out, the higher U.S. rates really for us is what's driving that decline. And as you point out, they've continued to rise throughout 2Q. Just a couple of reminders. One, rising rates is a improvement proving economic value situation for that business. But the reality is, right now, we have a solvency regime that has some asymmetrical accounting, so it creates some unintuitive results, if you will.  So so that's kind of one. Two, I'd say, remember in a few years, it's likely this moves to this new economic solvency regime, which would kind of better align the solvency accounting with the economic reality. And so we really -- we don't have concerns over dividends or dividend capacity at this time. The reality is that this is a good economic situation, and we have plenty of tools to be able to manage the overall situation. So at this time, we're fine.
Operator: And next, we move to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: You guys had strong results in LatAm in the quarter, and I know you called out around $40 million from favorable mortality. Can you just expand on the other underlying drivers of the results this quarter and just with the sustainability of results there?
Eric Clurfain: Elyse, this is Eric. So yes, as you pointed out. So overall, this was a strong quarter for the region, supported by solid business fundamentals and several positive items that we really put into 2 buckets, right, the market factors and underwriting. So starting with market factors, we had very strong net investment margins this quarter, which include the net positive impact of inflation in Chile as well as the above-average encaje results. And the quarter also benefited from strong variable investment income.  So these items combined contributed to roughly $60 million in adjusted earnings. Then the second bucket, underwriting, and John mentioned that earlier, this quarter was really recorded a 40 million after-tax benefit from a favorable prior year developments related mainly to COVID mortality experience. So these are the 2 main items. Now putting these items aside, we're also very pleased to see our business continues to deliver. As you may recall, last quarter, I mentioned that our earnings growth continued to be supported by strong and resilient business fundamentals, which are driving solid top line growth.  And that sales momentum that began last year has continued this quarter as well. And this reflects really the strengths, the resiliency and the diversity of our distribution franchise across the region, combined with a noticeable flight to quality. And then this emphasis on quality is also evidenced by a very solid persistency across the region, which, combined with the strong sales momentum that I mentioned has resulted in a 26% growth year-over-year in PFOs on a constant rate basis. Now about half of that growth came from the SPIA business in Chile, where our market share has increased, but the market as well has grown over the past over the past quarter. So that's in a nutshell, the story for LatAm this quarter. I hope this helps.
Elyse Greenspan: Yes. And then my second question, you guys bought back $1.1 billion in the quarter, a pretty strong number. Was there any acceleration in buybacks, just given the market weakness and an opportunity to buy your shares at a more attractive price? And can you just give us a sense of the outlook for future levels of share repurchase for the balance of the year?
Michel Khalaf: This is Michel. So yes, as I noted in my opening comments, we had our foot on the gas pedal a little bit in the second quarter, in particular. So expect a modestly slower pace, I would say, in the second half. Our overall view has not changed. Our philosophy, our approach have not changed. We're still comfortable with the $3 billion to $4 billion cash buffer over time. We'll get back to that. So no change in approach here. It's just that we had an acceleration in the first half. So it will be modestly slower in the second.
Operator: And our next question is from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.
Erik Bass: Can you provide some more color on the expected adjustment to retained earnings from adopting LDTI. And is this all being driven by the impact of bringing market risk benefits to fair value? Or are there any meaningful reserve adjustments? And I guess given the rise in interest rates since year-end '20, should we expect the adjustment to be smaller today than what you're showing on the slide?
John McCallion: Eric, it's John. So the impact to retained earnings, it affects both market risk benefits and a function of disaggregation. Disaggregation's about, I'd say, 20% to 25% of the number. So it's mainly a function of the fact that our -- under our -- for VAs and primarily the GMIBs, also, by the way, GMDBs get now mark to market, which is a different debate. But GMIBs, they're all kind of accrual accounting, if you will, and now they're moving to mark-to-market. So that's the biggest driver.  As we think about relative to initial impact that we disclosed, it's a little better as you get into kind of year-end '21 in terms of less of a change. I think interest rates moved maybe 60 basis points on the 10-year. And then it will continue to decline, if you will, as you move into 2022, just given the -- a function of the rising rate environment. So that's the -- those are the main drivers.
Erik Bass: Perfect. And then maybe if you could touch on your U.S. mortality experience this quarter across both Group and Holdings. And it looks like even ex COVID margins were favorable versus your targets. So have you seen some of the elevated non-COVID mortality that have been a factor in recent quarters? Has that started to come down as well?
Ramy Tadros: Eric. It's Ramy here. I'll start off with group and Michel and John will comment on Holdings. So for the quarter, if you look at our ratio sequentially, I would say the decline can be broken down into 4 pieces. So the first one is just the lower frequency in terms of overall population death. The second piece is the material decrease in the percentage of deaths under 65, which clearly reduced the impact on the working age population. The third piece is the Q1 reserves, which competed favorably, which John spoke about, and that was less than a point or so.  And then the final piece is we did see little by way of non-COVID excess mortality in the quarter. And as Michel pointed out, the second quarter tends to be a bit lighter in general in terms of mortality. As we look at the rest of the year, on the Group business side, we're cautiously optimistic given the results here. But clearly, you know the trajectory of the pandemic is uncertain. At this point, I would say, if you exclude COVID, we anticipate that our mortality ratio to be comfortably inside our range for the second half of the year for the group business.
John McCallion: Yes. And just on -- just touching on Holdings. I mean we certainly saw kind of a reduction in claims in the quarter. We didn't really see a big impact at all for COVID. And then on the -- if you just look at the life interest adjusted benefit ratio, you have to adjust for the reinsurance settlement. But excluding that, it comes in at 43.8. And that's -- we just saw a favorable non-COVID claim experience in the quarter.
Operator: And our next question is from Suneet Kamath with Jefferies.
Suneet Kamath: Maybe just for Steve to start out with. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about your outlook for credit and the potential for credit losses if we move into a recession? Is there any asset classes or sectors that you're paying particular attention to these days?
Steven Goulart: Sure. Thanks, Suneet. I think obviously, there's still a lot of uncertainty and clearly, volatility in the markets about where we're headed from a macro perspective. What I do is really sort of rewind the clock a little bit. And remember, in a way, we sound like a broken record, but we go back to really even pre-COVID where we were actually starting to get concerned about a recession occurring sometime in 2020 and started preparing the portfolio then.  Our derisking efforts started in a pretty big way. And I think then, of course, was accelerated during COVID, and we went through over $8 billion of derisking in that time period. And that really sort of set the portfolio in a position that we're very comfortable with.  Obviously, we continue to watch as we go through this period now, expectations of recessions, again, of course, depend how one defines a recession, I guess, these days are clearly picking up. But we're very comfortable with the derisking we've done over the last couple of years and think the portfolio is in very good shape.  Obviously, we continue to have a cautious attitude, but opportunistic at the same time because we do see some attractive investments and we have the opportunity to do that. one metric that might be of interest to is just in looking at the portfolio, during the course of this year, we've actually had twice as many upgrades as downgrades. And I think that says a lot about how we've been positioning the portfolio and our overall outlook. So we're very comfortable with where we are today.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. And then I guess for Ramy, on the Group Benefit side, I know Q2 is a low quarter for sales. But just curious on any color from the conversations you're having with your clients around pricing just given -- I'm assuming most of them are facing pressures across the board on cost from inflation. So just any color on how those conversations are going as we think about 1/1 next year?
Ramy Tadros: Sure. Just with respect to your comment on sales, as we've kind of discussed earlier, the year-to-date drop in sales is very much a function of the record year we had last year where we had a record number of jumbos. And as you know, these jumbos can be pretty lumpy. So this is something we expected in terms of the sales coming down. And I would just also point you to the fact that really the better measure to think about the overall growth of this business is the PFO number and we're certainly very pleased with the PFO growth number that we're seeing this quarter.  In terms of the pricing environment, I would say, the market is competitive, but remains rational. In aggregate, we have put in place price increases, both on the life and the disability side to reflect our expectation of the coming environment to reflect also a load with respect to the COVID deaths. And in aggregate, we are getting our target price increases, and we're also continuing to see very strong persistency in the book.
Operator: And our next question is from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.
Alexander Scott: First one I had for you was just to get your latest thoughts on MetLife Holdings and the potential for risk transfer. And also any commentary you have around if doing something -- taking action on something in holdings could influence the way that these impacts look from LDTI?
John McCallion: Alex, it's John. I think overall, on risk transfer, I'd say nothing new really to update. I mean we've probably given a consistent message every quarter for quite some time now. And I think it's the same, and I think we're being very transparent. Our goal here is continuously optimize. And we're trying to do that both in the form of internal actions but also looking at opportunities to leverage the growing risk transfer market. And as a result, we continue to converse with third parties.  Our philosophy is there's no burning platform. We're happy to maintain our approach and continue to optimize internally, but we want the optionality to see if we can accelerate the appropriate release of capital and reserves. I think the one thing that we continue to just look at here, this is a reinsurance transaction for us if we were to do something.  So as we think about our philosophy, when we look at this is, we view this as a long-term relationship. So it's -- this is one of those things that would take time. It takes time to make sure that we feel grounded with a strong counterparty and structure and kind of the approach.  But I think we're continuing to evaluate that and that's been the case now for some time. In terms of the impact to LDTI, I don't know how to exactly answer that. I think one thing we have to be careful about is under LDTI, one of the things that probably did not come out as perfect was just the -- there is some asymmetrical counting when you do enter into reinsurance. So you have to be mindful of that under GAAP. So it doesn't perfectly line up. So I don't know how to perfectly answer your question that way because it would -- I guess the answer is it depends. So I'm sure that...
Alexander Scott: It's helpful color. And then the follow-up I had was maybe just a question on sort of the broader economy. I mean, you guys get such an interesting look at the labor market, given your presence in the Group Benefits. I mean anything that you can give us color on, even maybe thinking through like beyond the end of the quarter that you're seeing in labor markets and potential implications just more broadly for your business?
Ramy Tadros: Alex, I would say, the numbers we're continuing to track clearly is just overall eligibility in our book, and we have a highly diversified book of business. And with the low unemployment levels, clearly, those numbers continue to kind of increase and remain very solid.  And we're seeing some kind of form of wage inflation come through as well, and both of these have been kind of tailwinds to the business. So we're kind of seeing in the book, what you're seeing probably in the broader economy. And maybe that's kind of as much color as I can give you in terms of what we're seeing.
Operator: And our next question is from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler.
John Barnidge: So you had an IBNR reserve release in both group and Latin America. Is there any tail that we should be thinking about for subsequent quarters from that?
John McCallion: John, it's John. Just when you say tail, you're referencing just more releases. Is that what you mean?
John Barnidge: Yes, correct.
John McCallion: Yes. Look, I think our -- this is a reserve. It's -- the reserve was put up at the point in time based on best estimates. I think in both cases, the facts are that actuals have emerged different than expected. And so that's just kind of the simple answer to why there was a release. I wouldn't assume there is a tail because if we had a -- if we assume there was more, we would have taken it.  So right now, our best estimates are what we have up on our balance sheet. But I think just like we do every quarter, we'll continue to evaluate and review the emergence of actuals. And if there are refinements needed, we'll make them.
John Barnidge: Okay. And then my follow-up to that, if we're talking about emergence versus expected, the LDTI disclosure, can you maybe talk about is there any unrealized insurance margin that's something we've seen from other companies that have large operations in Japan?
John McCallion: Yes. Sure, John. It's John again. Look, I think the reality on that one is it's really a function of mix of business. And I think that's -- if you listened to my earlier response to earnings and how some things are in scope and others are not, that's a major driver to kind of that outcome.  Many of our segments are not materially impacted by LDTI and many of the products we sell are not as well. And that includes like Asia, where some of those products are out there that show that unrealized in Asia. You think about in Japan, our flagship products are not subject to this. If you think about some of the, I wouldn't say all products, but some of the FX products that we sell, they're all under FAS 97. So it's a little bit of a different probably situation for us. And so I -- like I said, it really depends on mix of business to answer that question.
Operator: Next, we go to Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse.
Andrew Kligerman: A lot of most of the questions have been asked. But I'm wondering, as we look at another excellent quarter at MetLife, if there's anything transformative that you need to do from an M&A perspective, anything that you think in your business lines that could change kind of or improve MetLife?
Michel Khalaf: Andrew. So I don't think -- if we look at our portfolio, I think we don't see any major gaps when it comes to that portfolio. We're really well pleased. As you know, we've gone through a major transformation that got us to this point. We believe we have the right strategy. Having said that, M&A is a strategic capability and if we see opportunities to accelerate revenue growth in certain businesses that we -- where we believe, potentially doing something organically might make sense or bring in a capability that can help drive our competitive advantage, we'd certainly be open to doing so.  And look at a lot of deals and the -- maybe the sort of lack of deal should not suggest to you that there's a lack of activity here. We increased our shareholding in our India JV in the first quarter to 47%. So we continue to be active, but we're also very disciplined and whatever we do has to make strategic sense for us as well.
Andrew Kligerman: And then with regard to pension risk transfer, I think you said you did 3 deals of $2-plus billion. Maybe a little color around the pipeline. It seems like there are a lot of new players in pension risk transfer that we didn't see 3 years ago. So do you think that pipeline will continue to be robust and that we'll have quarters like this one.
Ramy Tadros: Andrew, it's Ramy here. I mean, as you know, the activity in the first half of the year was pretty substantial in the PRT space. Year-to-date, we've written $3.8 billion worth of deals, and that comes after a successful fourth quarter where we roll $3.6 billion worth of deals. So that's cumulatively about $7.5 billion year-over-year. The pipeline continues to be pretty active and pretty robust, as Michel mentioned.  And we are focused on a specific part of that pipeline where we enjoy our own kind of set of competitive advantages, namely the jumbo end of the plans, and there are fewer competitors there. When you go down size, clearly, there are more competition and more providers, but where we play, it's another set of competitors because of the size of the transactions that we bid for.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we will now turn the conference back to the CEO, Michel Khalaf.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you all for joining us this morning. I know it's a busy morning. Our second quarter results add to MetLife's track record of consistent, strong performance and provide further evidence of the strength and momentum of our well-diversified, market-leading businesses.  With our clarity of purpose, a compelling all-weather strategy and a relentless focus on execution, we are well positioned to deliver superior value to all our stakeholders. Thank you, and have a great day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-05 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about the forward-looking statements in yesterday’s earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife’s SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife’s first quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, I would point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which addressed the quarter. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In light of the busy morning, Q&A will last no later than the top of the hour. In fairness to all, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife delivered strong financial results in the first quarter of 2022, with the rise in geopolitical uncertainty and the pandemic that has not fully loosened its grip. These results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses. MetLife’s purpose of always with you building a more confident future is ringing true with our customers now more than ever. Starting with our financial results, we reported first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion or $2.08 per share, which was well above consensus expectations. The primary driver was strong variable investment income, partly offset by continued elevated COVID-19 claims, mostly in the U.S. Trends in our business point to continued momentum despite the many global dislocations. Net income for the quarter was $606 million, up from $290 million a year ago and below adjusted earnings in the quarter. Losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet from interest rate movement and payments on bonds account for most of the difference between net income and adjusted earnings. Interest rates rose rapidly during the quarter with the yield on the 10-year treasury advancing 83 basis points, triggering market value adjustments to our derivative hedges. The tragic events in Ukraine led to an impairment of Russian and Ukrainian bonds in the quarter. Let’s shift to our continued strong performance and variable investment income, which totaled $1.2 billion pre-tax in the quarter. Private equity was again the engine producing an approximately 7% quarterly return, with the higher PD balances also a factor. Our private equity returns are reported on a one quarter lag and the weaker first quarter equity market may impact or VII results in the second quarter. For MetLife, private equity has long been an important source of value creation, generating strong returns and supporting our long dated liabilities. It is an asset class we manage prudently. Last quarter, we indicated that we would divest roughly $1 billion of general account PE assets. Just after the first quarter close, we launched a PE fund of funds to be managed by MetLife Investment Management and the transaction that creatively and thoughtfully addressed investment allocation, while establishing a new fee generating business venture. Turning to some first quarter business segment highlights, I will start with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings of $112 million were up 20% year-over-year. We saw strong growth within our current customer base, reflecting a combination of higher enrollment, higher employment level and higher salaries. Although, COVID-19 life claims remained elevated, the Group life mortality ratio fell sequentially 250 basis points to 103.8%. Our flagship U.S. Group Benefits franchise has generated a profit for shareholders in every quarter since the pandemic began, a testament to the breadth, strength and resilience of this business. With our scalar leadership, the biggest threat in this business is becoming complacent something we will simply not allow to happen. We have taken concrete actions to grow and establish products like Group Life, Dental and Disability, voluntary products like legal and newer products like vision and Pat [ph]. The results are showing up in solid recurring PFOs, which have grown by more than $3 billion over the last three years looking past per claims. In Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 16%, primarily due to a tough comparison as the strong contribution from VII in the current quarter fell below the extraordinary contribution of a year ago. Beyond VII, a number of key metrics in this business were strong, including volume growth and spreads. Continuing the momentum from the fourth quarter, we booked a $1.3 billion pension risk transfer deal in the first quarter. With funding level strong and interest rates on the rise, we see a robust PRT pipeline going forward. For Asia, adjusted earnings similarly benefited from strong VII, partly offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. At the same time, business momentum was solid. General account AUM was up 7% on a constant currency basis from a year ago. Sales in Asia grew 2% on a constant currency basis year-over-year driven by a good fiscal year end in Japan. In Latin America, adjusted earnings were up by more than $100 million from the prior period. As COVID 19 claims moderated in Mexico, the exceptional sales success posted in 2021 has carried into 2022 with sales on a constant currency basis jumping 40% in the first quarter. The pandemic has ushered in a renewed focus on the importance of insurance across Latin America. This has fueled a flight to quality, which in turn has helped drive our sales and boost our persistency. Shifting to capital and cash, we returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchase in the first quarter. Based on the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we announced a 4.2% increase in our common dividend per share, which has grown at a compound annual rate of 9.5% since 2011. With $475 million left on our current repurchase authorization, our Board of Directors has authorized an incremental $3 billion authorization, which brings our total buyback capacity to roughly $3.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.2 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies. Despite the seasonally low quarter for subsidiary dividends, we remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April, will contribute to our cash balances in the second quarter. Turning to governance, MetLife has a highly experienced and diverse Board of Directors and we were pleased to announce the addition of Carla Harris at the end of April. Carla is a well-recognized leader across the financial services industry. She brings deep expertise and fresh perspectives and her experience and knowledge will serve MetLife well. Our talent is also a competitive advantage that sets us apart from our peers. As a global company, MetLife can grow talent from around the world and match it to our greatest opportunities. Our recent leadership changes demonstrate this deep strength. I want to start by thanking Kishore Ponnavolu for his distinguished service to MetLife over the past 11 years. During his time with MetLife, Kishore served as Chief Enterprise Strategy Officer and Head of MetLife Auto and Home, and finally as Regional President, Asia, where his leadership delivered outstanding results. When Kishore steps away from this position at the end of June, we will rotate several executives into new roles. Lyndon Oliver will move from Treasurer and Head of Strategy to Regional President, Asia. John Hall will add Treasurer to his current responsibilities and Dimitri Lorenzon will move from Head of Strategy Product and Marketing from MetLife Japan to Head of Strategy for MetLife. These moves demonstrate our commitment to talent development and highlight our deep bench of leaders who are ready to step up and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. We are broadening and deepening our leadership commitment to and accountability for diversity, equity and inclusion. At the end of quarter, MetLife announced a broad set of VII commitment designed to address the needs of the underserved and underrepresented by 2030. These commitments encompass a mix of investments, partnerships and solutions, and other efforts, and are firmly aligned with MetLife’s purpose. In setting these commitments, we are establishing clear roadmaps and strengthening accountability for progress. Before I close, I would like to say a few words about MetLife return to office in the U.S., which started on March 28th. Our new model Future Work combines the best of office and virtual environments and is an essential element in attracting and retaining top talent. Our Future Work model has been well received in the U.S. and we are seeing tremendous collaboration and partnership across the organization. We are also well underway to adopting our Future Work model outside the U.S. as conditions allow. From my own perspective, it is great to walk the floors again, host in-person meetings and feel of the energy in the building. Over the past few weeks, I have visited several of our offices across the U.S. and the team’s enthusiasm and energy levels have been outstanding. I look forward to more such visits as the world increasingly open and I also welcome the opportunity to sit down face to face with many of you in the months ahead. The past two years has been an unprecedented period, but with all of the challenges, MetLife remain laser focused on consistent execution and we look forward to building on our momentum. With that, I will turn things over to John.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 1Q 2022 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income was $606 million or $1.1 billion lower than adjusted earnings. The majority of this variance was due to net derivative losses as a result of the significant rise in long-term interest rates in the quarter. In addition, we had net investment losses, primarily due to impairments on our Russian premium bonds, as well as normal trading activity in the portfolio that resulted in losses given the rising interest rate environment. Following the impairments and a sale of Russian bonds in April, our current combined exposure in Russia and Ukraine is roughly $125 million. On page four, you can see the first quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which did not have any notable items on either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion, down 12% and down 10% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income accounted for the majority of the year-over-year decline. While private equity returns were again strong, they compared to an even stronger Q1 of 2021, adjusted earnings per share was $2.08, down 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 4% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S., Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 20% year-over-year due to higher volume growth and an improvement in underwriting margins. I will discuss Group Life underwriting in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 72.5% in Q1 of 2022 at the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. That said, the ratio higher than the prior year quarter of 71.1%, due to higher incidences in disability relative to favorable incidence levels in the prior year quarter. Turning to topline, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% year-over-year. This growth included 2 percentage points related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. The balance of the PFO growth of 5% was due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Group Benefits sales were down 31% compared to record sales in Q1 of 2021, which were driven by exceptionally strong jumbo cases. While jumbo case activity was significantly lower in 1Q 2022, we continue to see good growth in the business and our persistency remained strong. Retirement Income Solutions or RIS adjusted earnings were down 16% year-over-year. The primary driver was less favorable private equity returns versus a very strong Q1 of 2021. Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 181 basis points, driven by another strong quarter of variable investment income, spreads excluding VII were 89 basis points, up 1 basis point versus 1Q 2021, but down 2 basis points sequentially due to higher LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures were essentially flat year-over-year, as growth across most products primarily U.K. longevity reinsurance and pension risk transfers were offset by lower separate account balances. With regards to pension risk transfers, we completed one transaction worth $1.3 billion in the first quarter and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia, the adjusted earnings were down 7% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower recurring interest margins and a decline in first quarter equity markets in Japan and Korea. This is partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 7% on a constant currency basis. In addition, sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis driven by strong sales in Japan. Latin America adjusted earnings were $142 million versus $40 million in the prior year quarter, while COVID-19 related claims remained elevated in 1Q 2002 at roughly $30 million after-tax. They were down significantly versus the prior year quarter. In addition, volume growth was a positive contributor, while lower equity markets were a partial offset. The Chilean Encaje had negative 4% return in 1Q 2022 versus the prior year quarter, which was a modest positive. While LatAm’s bottomline has been trending towards pre-pandemic levels, its topline continues to demonstrate strength as adjusted PFOs were up 22% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and sales were up 40% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 27% and 15% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the exclusion of divested businesses, Poland and Greece, which were included in the first quarter of 2021 adjusted earnings. In addition, higher expenses were partially offset by favorable underwriting margins and volume growth. While the region reported excess COVID claims in Q1, they were lower than the prior year quarter. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 39%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income and less favorable underwriting. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $117 million versus an adjusted loss of $171 million in the prior year quarter. Higher variable investment income was the result of a $1.1 billion transfer of PE assets to corporate and other from IRS and MetLife Holdings in Q1 of 2022. To better align asset liability management for these two segments, higher expenses were partial offset. The company’s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 21.3% and within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. Now, I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on page five. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the last five quarters, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. The Group Life mortality ratio was one hundred and 103.8 in the first quarter of 2022, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims were roughly 14% points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $230 million. While U.S. COVID deaths were higher sequentially, there was a favorable shift in the percentage of deaths under age 65, declining from approximately 33% in the fourth quarter to roughly 23% in the first quarter. As a result of these two competing factors, we saw a modest improvement in mortality results this quarter. In addition we experienced 1 percentage point to 2 percentage points from non-COVID excess mortality. This included a large number of high dollar claims, which can fluctuate from period-to-period. On page six, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the past five quarters, including $1.2 billion in the first of 2022. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall return of 7% in the quarter. Unlike previous quarters where we have seen a dispersion in returns by fund type, this quarter our major PE returns were tightly coupled around 7% overall. As we have previously discussed, private equities generally accounted for on a quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds were also a strong contributor to VII with a 10% return in the quarter, while hedge funds, which are reported on a one-month lag had a loss. On page seven, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior five quarters, including $936 million in Q1 of 2022. You will note that our general rule of thumb that RIS, MetLife Holdings in Asia account for 90% or more of the total VII did not hold in 1Q 2022, coming in at 83%. This lower percentage was primarily due to the transfer of PES to corporate and other from RIS and MetLife Holdings that I discussed earlier. In addition, Asia’s higher VII year-over-year was primarily due to strong real estate equity fund performance, as well as higher PE asset balances. Turning to page eight, this chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters, including 11.7% in Q1 of 2022. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our first quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid topline growth and ongoing expense discipline. This included approximately 40 basis points from premiums that relate to participating cases in Group Benefits due to excess mortality. We remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3% in 2022, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on page nine. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at March 31st, which was down from $5.4 billion at December 31st, but remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decline in cash at the holding companies reflect the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $915 million in the first quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Our first quarter tends to be lower in subsidiary dividends and higher in holding company expenses. Therefore, we would expect HoldCo cash balances to increase in the second quarter due to higher subsidiary dividends, as well as proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April, as Michel noted. In regard to our statutory capital, for our U.S. companies are 2021 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 386%, which was above our target ratio of 360%. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first-quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $400 million, while net income was approximately $800 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $1.1 billion year-over-year primarily due to less favorable VA rider reserves, underwriting results and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.7 billion as of March 31, 2022, down 2% compared to December 31, 2021. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 947% as of December 31st, which is the latest public data. Looking ahead, we expect the Japan SMR to decline in 2022, as a result of higher U.S. interest rates, but remained well above its capital target level. Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by outstanding private equity returns, solid topline growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities that allow us to navigate successfully through uncertain environments. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remain strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the Operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we go to the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Could you discuss your outlook for the retirement spread over the next few quarters in light of the higher interest rate environment but also the flatter yield curve?
Michel Khalaf: Good morning, Ryan. Yes. So, let me just start with Q1, obviously it was 181, main driver there being VII and then our result ex-VII was 89 basis points of spread. And just -- maybe start with just the sequential decline in the spread with a few basis points and that was generally the rising LIBOR, which is something we highlighted as in our sensitivities that would put pressure on the spread. I think one of the things that was performed better than expected as we did see a recovery in some of our real estate property income investments in the quarter in Q1, so that helped to offset some of that downward pressure that we expected. I’d say, given the upward trend in LIBOR we have already seen in 2Q, we would probably expect kind of that mid single-digit decline to occur that we would have thought to have seen in the first quarter, but to start to see in the second quarter. But if the forward curves come to fruition, we would actually start to see maybe a shift in the spread moving back up a little bit, and I’d say, there’s probably two reasons for that. So one is, so we get these sensitivities at the outlook and then typically the day after they are not as good as they were the day before. Ad so in terms of LIBOR, we talked about a rise in LIBOR having a headwind, at some point that kind of flips to be a positive and that’s probably kind of around the 200-basis-point level and so we are at maybe a little above 130-basis-point today. So, we expect kind of rising LIBOR to continue to pressure us in the second quarter, but if it continues to rise, it would actually begin to provide income. And then the second thing as you point out just kind of the overall increase in rates, it typically comes in 10 -- the benefit of the 10-year comes in at a slower, not as quickly and so, but that will start to emerge over time. So hopefully that helps.
Ryan Krueger: Thanks. Very helpful. And then, I guess, the follow-up is just I think we all know rising interest rates are generally good for life insurance. I just want to make sure that there are any unusual impact from things like interest rate derivative mark on a stat basis that would have any kind of negative impact on dividend capacity going forward?
Michel Khalaf: Yeah. We don’t -- we would not expect any unusual impacts to occur. I think the broad interest rate sensitivities we gave as part of our outlook directionally still hold, even though the shape of the curve is a little different, so numbers may not be exact, but I would say the directional nature of that from an earnings perspective, which means that it’s a little negative in the first year, may -- I might call it neutral-ish now just the way things have kind of panned out and then you start to see kind of the positive momentum emerge in the 2023 and 2024, again, assuming rates kind of pan out as they are projected to. And then in terms of stat capital now, we would not expect any unusual volatility or result as a -- as a result of a rising rate environment.
Ryan Krueger: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. First, I just had a question on what you are seeing in terms of activity in the pension closeout market. I think you mentioned that the pipeline is healthy, but how do you see, I guess, interest rates are obviously benefiting, but the weak equity market and its impact on funding levels, are you seeing a little bit of a slowdown or just the uncertainty causing plan sponsors to put off any transactions.
Ramy Tadros: Good morning, Jimmy. It’s Ramy here. So, maybe just, I will -- maybe helpful just to reiterate our philosophy towards the PRT market and then I will come and hit your question in terms of the pipeline. The two aspects of our philosophy, which I would like to reiterate here and highlight one is that, this is a business where we continue to exercise pricing discipline, and I would say in aggregate, our capital deployment in the business is in line with our enterprise ROE targets and it’s also accretive to the in-force annuity spreads. The second one, which you have heard us talk about before is that, we are focused on the large and jumbo end of the market. There are fewer players there and the deals tend to play to our competitive strengths in terms of size and rating, our balance sheet and the investment capabilities. In terms of the outlook, as you know, we have a very strong quarter in 2021. The fourth quarter of 2021, we ended with five transaction that were total of $3.6 billion. We did one transaction this quarter for $1.3 billion and we still see a very robust pipeline in front of us as we look towards the rest of the year. In terms of the segments we play in that jumbo segment. Many of these plans have been on a multiyear derisking journey, so they don’t kind of turn on a dime, if you will, in terms of making that decision. So a lot of those kinds of asset allocations have been pre-positioned, and therefore, that jumbo end, it doesn’t tend to be as sensitive to equity market volatility. But having said that, clearly, the overall market, as it stands today stands at a very high funding levels and that bodes well for the overall pipeline as well.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thanks. And then on your Latin American sales, they were pretty strong across every single major market. To what extent is that a function of the pandemic receding versus just anything that you have done on the product or distribution side.
Eric Clurfain: Yes. Hi, Jimmy. This is Eric here. So, yeah, you noticed the sales momentum really demonstrates, really the strength and -- of our distribution channels and the diversity of our product mix. We are seeing the benefits of that diversification strategy that combined with the increased awareness that Michel mentioned and that demand of insurance combined with the swift implementation of digital capabilities before during and now as we get out of the pandemic allows us to sell and serve our customers better and the marketplace is really responding to this with a true flight to quality. And that emphasis on quality is also evidenced by the strong persistency, which combined with the robust sales as resulted with an over 20% growth year-over-year on PFOs on a constant currency basis. Now about half of that’s -- these sales are coming from the SPA [ph] business in Chile, as we have seen the annuity market expanding during the first quarter. So, overall I would say, it’s a combination of factors and the strength of our franchise in LatAm is showing up as the pandemic recedes.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, we have seen move up in interest rates this year. I was just wondering if that has an impact on the potential fee by secure transaction with one of your blocks within holdings.
John McCallion: Hey, Elyse. It’s John. Good morning. I think as we have said before, rising interest rates are, I think, beneficial to the block, the risk transfer, block transfer market and I think there is, so that gives, but I don’t think that’s the only thing that people are focused on. I don’t think it changes materially. I think is a modest positive as we have talked about improving interest rates, solid equity markets, I think they all kinds of support a healthy risk transfer market. So, but again, I don’t think that’s the only driver and I think as we have seen over the years, the last few years, there is been plenty of transactions even at lower rates. So, but again, I think, it’s a modest positive.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then within Group, you guys called out the non-COVID mortality this quarter. I just was hoping to get a little bit more color there and if you guys expect this to continue as we move through this year and even potentially get on the other side of the pandemic.
Michel Khalaf: Hi, Elyse. I would say what we saw this quarter is very much in line with kind of normal quarterly fluctuations we see. Just to give you some color in terms of one of the drivers here, if you look at our kind of large claims here define, let’s say, you take a $2 million mark. We have got higher number of those claims. But when I say higher, you think high-single digits and we have got quarters when that came below our expectation. So this is kind of normal quarterly fluctuation. We clearly look at the numbers, we are the largest writer of Group Life Benefits in the industry, and as of this point, we are not seeing any real evidence outside of COVID of any long-term adverse trends here.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Next we go to the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Hi. Thank you. In the Group business, can you talk about enrollment and persistency trends in the level of benefit you are seeing from rising employment and rates growth?
Michel Khalaf: Erik, could you just repeat the question, you were just coming off a bit.
Erik Bass: Sorry, I was just asking in the Group business, if you could talk about enrollment and persistency trends and then the level of benefit that you are seeing from rising employment and wage growth?
Michel Khalaf: Sure. In terms of persistency, we continue to see very, very strong persistency on our book. That’s up and down market and very much kind of in line with our expectations. And as I have highlighted before, we are seeing that persistency even in a environment where we have been taking price increases on -- in particular on the life book given the uncertainty around COVID, so the persistency has been really excellent. We are also seeing continued momentum on our voluntary portfolio and that’s going to continue to drive double-digit PFO growth in our business. And just to give you a flavor of that, we ended the year well above $1 billion of PFOs in voluntary and we continue to see good growth on that. In terms of employment, that’s a tailwind. We are starting to see that in the business. Clearly higher employment levels provide just more eligibles and therefore more premiums. Wage inflation is another tailwind, although that does play out gradually over time. So we don’t expect that to see kind of having an immediate uptick and it does depend on the population that’s getting those wage increases, et cetera, but both of these I would think of as general tailwinds to the business and we are seeing evidence of that in our book today.
Erik Bass: Great. Thank you. And then can you discuss your earnings and capital exposures to a weaker yen and what hedges you have in place?
Kishore Ponnavolu: Hi, Erik. This is Kishore. So if you think about the yen impact, you can think about this in two aspects. One is the translation impact on earnings and the second one is the impact on sales. On earnings, we have a multi-currency balance sheet in Japan, because of our FX products. And if you think about it holistically for MetLife Asia, roughly 15% of our earnings are yen-denominated and so, therefore, any depreciation on the yen has a moderate impact, I can say that on Asia adjusted earnings. On the sales, however, the FX volatility more than the rate itself is the volatility that is very important to rates consideration as well. It impacts volumes so far FX products in the near-term. In periods of high FX volatility, our customers tend to wait and see before the commit there yen to be converted to U.S. dollars, say, if it’s the U.S. dollar product. At the same time, the yen, the increase in U.S. dollar rates, which is certainly true now enhances the customer value making them more attractive. So there is a balanced both ways. And currently, we are seeing the impact of both the yen weakening and the higher U.S. dollar interest rates on both sides. So if you think about, that’s the way I would look at it. I will leave it at that.
Erik Bass: Great. Thank you
Operator: And our next question is from Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Good morning. First question is just can you provide a little bit of color behind the around $400 billion of investment losses. I presume most of that was Russia-Ukraine, but can you just give some specificity for the accounting for the $400 million?
Steve Goulart: Sure. Hey, Tom. It’s Steve Goulart. And you are right on that, but I think, John mentioned is too in his script, too, there really were two issues that led to virtually all of the realized losses in the first quarter. One, as you point out was Russia and that was roughly half of the credit losses and provisions. And again, I’d start out by reminding everyone that our total exposure to Russia is less than one-tenth of 1% of the general account. So, in sum some not really a material number. And then the second piece on the losses, John also mentioned was, normal trading activity, but that really just reflected what was happening with interest rates in the quarter. And if you think about, again, our asset liability management, we are heavily investing in private assets right now, and it takes time to originate those private assets. So we are putting in assets that are more liquid and as we replace those in the permanent structure with private assets, given the interest rate movements in the quarter we saw losses in that. But again we pick it up on the back end, of course, because the private assets are higher yielding.
Tom Gallagher: Got it. That makes sense, Steve. So I would assume some of that, there could be a little bit of a tail to the trading aspect of that as you roll into 2Q and rates have continued to go up. Is that fair.
Steve Goulart: I think as long as rates are moving, we will probably see similar action and similar results, yeah.
Tom Gallagher: Okay. Got you. And then, just, I guess for Kishore, just a follow-up on Japan, the sales there seemed pretty good and your competitors that are in Japan were quite weak with the state of emergency orders in Japan. Just curious how you were able to drive sales growth, is there something unique about product launches or your distribution that that allowed you to still grow sales across -- it looks like across all products in Japan.
Kishore Ponnavolu: I love the premise of your question, Erik, and I will certainly pass on that complement to our associates in Japan. I think it’s a great question. I love the way you worded it. Certainly, that said, our sales increased 18% in Japan. That’s a very strong performance. There are three reasons why I would attribute that. We -- our execution on the ground has been quite strong Secondly, we do have a very diversified channel mix, as you know, and that is continuing to show where certainly there is a little bit of softness on the banker side on a relative basis, but that got picked up on the CA, so that balance is back and forth certainly is coming through really well. And then, thirdly, we have been investing quite a bit on our products and capabilities over the past two years. But most notably over the past 12 months, we have had a couple of successful product launches, and most recently, we entered the quarterly market again and so that was well received in the marketplace. We launched a new banker platform in last year, which has got very strong reception and then we also entered the variable product markets. So that’s also getting good traction as well. So we are very happy about that. However, since you asked the question, I wanted to give you a little bit of context for overall Asia in terms of our performance this quarter, which is really were very good, but also caution that, we are continuing to deal with COVID and that’s a big factor across all our markets, clearly, Korea and Japan, we have a surge in cases in quarter one and we are dealing with that even in China as well, And so-- and then on top of that, in Q2, we are dealing with a bunch of market-specific regulatory and exchange related challenges, which are ongoing. And then there is a seasonality factor in Q1 with March being the fiscal year-end, so that’s been a tailwind which doesn’t carry through Q2. Given all that, the volume of sales in the next quarter will be under pressure. But on a year-on-year basis, I expect Asia ex-Japan to come stronger in Q2 to offset that as well. So that’s done well in Q1, little bit of pressure in Q2 and then I want to switch to the overall frame, which is despite all of this. Our execution has been very strong. Our diversity of markets are coming through. And so, from a guidance perspective, hitting to the mid-to-high single sales growth guidance we gave in February. And in terms of timing, I expect a much stronger year-on-year performance in the second half for Asia as a whole. So I hope that was helpful from a commentary perspective.
Tom Gallagher: That was. Thank you.
Kishore Ponnavolu: Great.
Operator: And -- oh, go ahead. My apologies. Mr. Gallagher, did you have anything further.
Tom Gallagher: No. That’s all. Thank you.
Operator: Very good. We will move on to Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to Group Life for a second. So we are seeing COVID deaths -- COVID mortality decline pretty substantially here in 2Q, but just wondering as we think about earnings in that business in 2Q, is there any kind of lag that we should be reflecting in terms of when you may get death notices in Group?
Ramy Tadros: Hey. It’s Ramy here. Generally speaking, we are pretty quick in terms of recognizing the getting the death claims and recognizing those and we clearly hold the reserved essentially account for the IBNR. So I would say, on average, we have been getting up pretty well over the last kind of year and a half. So I would just continue to anchor any of your kind of estimates based on the headline mortality numbers for the entire population. So I would say, you looked at those and those have trended favorably in April. And the other statistic, I would also look at, is the percentage of deaths, which are under 65, which looking at April, that has continued to be at the same level as we saw in the first quarter, which, as John mentioned, would be favorable for us from a severity perspective.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then, I guess, for John on capital. I think you had said that, statutory operating earnings was lower than stat net income. So I just want to make sure I got that right and maybe some color on what happened there? And then, also, I think you said, Pat decline relative to the end of the year. So can you just talk a little bit about what happened there?
John McCallion: Sure. Good morning. Good morning, Suneet. Yeah. That’s right. I mean I think it’s just the kind of some of the geography between our -- where our VA reserves go versus some of the kind of the hedges and you think about just what equity markets did that probably explains some of that difference and some of the realization of that. So that’s kind of number one. You commented and then your second point is just on stat capital generation. Yeah, I think, it was down 2%, so maybe a little over $300 million. I’d kind of put that in the normal volatility in any one quarter we paid our normal kind of a fourth of 25% of our kind of target dividend for the year, give or take in the quarter and which had a little additional volatility. So I wouldn’t read into that any -- in anyway, I’d kind of sort of consider that to be normal volatility and I wouldn’t consider a trend.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And next we go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First one I had is on just expenses. I think they have kind of consistently come in below sort of the target you guys outlined at Investor Day with the Horizon strategy and so forth, and you are achieving pretty good organic growth across a number of your businesses. And so I was just interested in any commentary on where that could go from here. If -- I think sometimes in the past you have called out one timers and things like that on expenses that would get you back up to sort of the targeted level, but this feels like maybe you are benefiting more from operating leverage and could it be driven down further from there.
John McCallion: Good morning, Alex. Yes. We are certainly pleased with the execution and that’s not without headwinds and what we are all dealing with today in terms of inflation, wage increases and things like that, but I think it’s a testament to the team and really the embedded culture that we have built here around efficiency mindset. It’s a critical point of our strategy as you mentioned. And just on the ratio itself, it was 11.7. I mentioned in the opening remarks that, you have to be careful, the headline number is probably benefiting about 40 basis points from elevated COVID claims, which impact our participating cases and that creates increase in revenue is a bit of a gross-up on the P&L. So, net-net, we are still -- we are a little above 12, but maybe -- but still below the 12.3. And that’s -- within there is also includes our intention to continue to invest in the firm for growth to improve our use of technologies and then, obviously, if circumstances dictate that gives us optionality to leverage that capacity in different ways and to protect margins. So, all in all, I’d say, we are executing on our target, our initiative, when it comes to managing expenses.
Alex Scott: Thanks. And then my follow-up is just if you could provide a brief update on the asset management business and just what you are thinking in terms of inorganic opportunities that are out there and if the current environment makes that more challenging or maybe it presents more opportunities, just interested in if anything changing there?
Steve Goulart: Hey, Alex. It’s Steve Goulart. So the updated continues to be very positive. We continue to grow MetLife Investment Management. I think we have been really achieving an aggressive organic growth plan that is in line with what we laid out at our 2019 Investor Day on our objectives and targets for where we are going to see the business grow. At the same time, you are right, it’s a very active market right now and we continue to be active in it as well and looking at opportunities for acquisitions and it does cut both ways and there is a lot of activity, but there are a lot of people looking in the markets, too. We know what we are looking for strategically. We are very disciplined financially and we want to make sure that anything we do fits culturally and strategically. So we will continue to be active and hopefully when we find something that meets those criteria we will be successful in acquiring it.
Alex Scott: Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Tracy Benguigui: Good morning. I realized later in the year you review your reserving assumption, but still were the 10-year treasury you read it today at 3% and where it maybe heading and how should we be thinking about your 2.75% reversion mean assumption and how does inflation come into play with respect to your reserve position?
Michel Khalaf: Hey. Good morning, Tracy. Good question. Obviously, we have that long-term assumption and things have changed quite a bit. I think it’s early for us to make any predictions at this point. Obviously, as we get into that kind of the end of the second quarter into the third quarter, really more of the third quarter, we will start to think about it. I think as we have all realized that things can change quickly. So -- and so I think it’s -- and it is a long-term assumption. But having said that, I think, you highlighted some kind of the circumstances we are in that the current rates are higher than our long-term assumption that we are -- we projected to hit in 12 years. So that is -- but I wouldn’t anticipate kind of any abrupt change one way or the other, we just made that change recent, few years ago and so you need to kind of see a trend before you would necessarily make a change, but again we will have to kind of evaluate all the data that’s out there when we get closer. In terms of inflation, it’s probably, it’s not a -- it’s really, I’d say, probably, more related to your first part of the question, what does that, how does that really impact rates. That’s probably the biggest area for us when it comes to reserving. I think outside of that, it’s -- there is generally, if you have any inflation impact, it’s generally offset by other factors, net-net, so that’s probably how I’d answer the inflation point.
Tracy Benguigui: Great. Thank you. I noticed in prior years, you didn’t fully utilize your U.S. statutory dividend capacity, but in 2021 it appear in the U.S. Co. and I realize you have various sources. But just looking at Metropolitan Life Insurance Company you have $3.5 billion ordinary capacity in 2022, are you expecting again to fully utilize that this year?
John McCallion: Yeah. I think, as you point out, we have a lot of sources of cash to the holding company. I think what we have committed to, we don’t commit to kind of a dividend in any one legal entity. And I think the benefit of having a diverse set of cash generation that can be sent to the holding company is that, it gives us the benefit of being able to commit to the 65% to 75% free cash flow ratio on average over two-year period. And so it’s not something we target at any one entity. We look at all aspects of how we are trying to manage our cash and capital at the operating entities, where we are looking to grow, where we need extra capital, things like that. And I think the benefit is, like I said, it’s a diverse set of sources is very helpful. So we don’t set a target at any legal entity externally, I should say, and then we kind of, just like you manage your own wallet, we manage our collective wallets the same way.
Tracy Benguigui: Thank you.
Operator: And we have no more questions at this time. I will turn the call back to Michel Khalaf.
Michel Khalaf: Great. Well, thank you again for joining us on this busy morning. Our strong performance in the first quarter of 2022 building on last year’s outstanding results should provide further evidence of the significant progress we are making in delivering on our all-weather Next Horizon strategy. This management team is laser-focused on continuing to execute with urgency and we are confident in our ability to create long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders. Thanks again and talk soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-03 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings and Outlook Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday’s earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife’s SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife’s fourth quarter 2021 earnings and near-term outlook call. Before we begin, I’d point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last evening, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter as well as our near-term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In light of the busy morning, Q&A will last no later than the top of the hour. In fairness to all, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John and good morning everyone. MetLife’s financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 was outstanding. Our strategic decisions to diversify MetLife by product and geography allocate a prudent portion of our assets to private equity, balanced growth with cash generation and return excess capital to shareholders paid off in the form of banner adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share. In the fourth quarter of 2021, MetLife delivered adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion level with Q4 2020. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.17, up 7% year-over-year. Excluding the notable tax item in the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.01. Heading into the quarter, one of the biggest questions facing life insurers was whether Q4 COVID-related impacts would be as challenging as they were in Q3. In the U.S. group business, that remains the case as lower severity was offset by higher frequency to keep the group life ratio well above normal, yet MetLife’s diversity remained evident and the continued outperformance of our investment portfolio. Variable investment income contributed $1.3 billion in the quarter. Our private equity holdings returned 7.9%, with venture capital once again the standout at 13%. As we noted last quarter, PE generates significant cash for MetLife. Over the last 6 years, cash distributions from the portfolio have totaled $8.6 billion. Looking at 2021 as a whole, it was a year of performance, purpose and progress. MetLife delivered strong performance across the board. Despite the divestiture of P&C and other businesses, adjusted PFOs, excluding PRTs were still up 2% to $45.5 billion. Full year sales were up 40% in U.S. group, 19% in Latin America and 11% in Asia. The return on our private equity portfolio was above 40%. Our direct expense ratio was down 40 basis points to 11.6% and we reported adjusted earnings of $8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $9.15, both the highest amount ever posted by MetLife. We believe our growing track record of consistent execution even in the face of adversity has reinforced the narrative of MetLife as a resilient company. MetLife’s purpose is to be there for our customers, always helping them build a more confident future. Nowhere is a life insurance company’s purpose more evident than in the grips of a pandemic. Over the course of 2021, COVID claims totaled $2 billion globally and $3 billion since the beginning of the pandemic. We cannot heal the pain of losing a loved one, but we can and do help families recover from the financial damage so that they can move forward. We are honored to be part of an industry that makes such a positive difference in people’s lives. Finally, 2021 was a year in which we continued to make progress on the pillars of our Next Horizon strategy. We remain focused on deploying capital to its most productive use. In the absence of attractive M&A opportunities, we returned significant capital to shareholders. We continued to simplify the company through strategic divestitures and further strengthening our operating leverage. Despite higher inflation, we still expect our direct expense ratio to be below 12.3% for the full year 2022. And we further differentiated MetLife with an entry into the financial wellness space called Upwise that allows us to connect directly with consumers and help them build the habits of financial success. MetLife continues to invest billions of dollars every year in organic growth with attractive payback periods and internal rates of return. But as we have said many times, we will not pursue growth for growth’s sake. When growth is attractive, whether organic or by acquisition, we will invest. When it is not, we will return capital to shareholders to redeploy elsewhere in the economy. We were pleased in 2021 to return a record of nearly $6 billion of capital to MetLife’s shareholders. We paid $1.6 billion in common stock dividends and repurchased $4.3 billion worth of common shares. Even after these significant distributions, we ended 2021 with $5.4 billion of cash and liquid assets on our balance sheet, well above the top end of our $3 billion to $4 billion target buffer. We repurchased $1.2 billion of common shares in the fourth quarter and we have $1.5 billion left on the repurchase authorization, our Board of Directors approved in August. As a management team, we have no higher obligation to shareholders than to be responsible stewards of the capital they have entrusted us with. As we look ahead, we see a landscape marked with both opportunities and risks. But on balance, we are more optimistic than we were a year ago. John McCallion will provide our detailed outlook expectations shortly. I would like to discuss the road ahead at a more thematic level. While we are always cautious about the external environment, which consists of many factors we cannot control, we do see a unique confluence of tailwinds that should provide positive momentum to our business. Rising interest rates are an obvious one provided the yield curve cooperates and we are pleased that the Federal Reserve has signaled a return to more normal monetary policy. Our U.S. group benefits business should benefit from rising overall employment and compensation levels. The war for talent is as intense as we have ever seen it and we believe that benefits will remain a powerful tool to help companies compete. As our most recent employee benefit trend study found, this applies across the spectrum. Baby-boomers are placing higher value on their physical health. For example, 71% say vision insurance is a must have, up from 53% the prior year. And Gen Z is showing heightened interest in benefits such as legal services, student debt relief and life insurance. In Asia and Latin America, consumer demand for insurance products is strong and Latin America, our sales are back to pre-pandemic levels. And in Asia, especially Japan, the business is benefiting from new offerings and the positive impact of rising U.S. interest rates on foreign currency-denominated products. None of this is to deny the uncertainty we still face from COVID. We have seen false dawns before only to be hit with new waves of the virus. Our view is that the wisest call on the pandemic is not to make a call. We are steadfastly making good on our promises, while continuing to evaluate and reflect the new reality in our pricing. I will close this morning by emphasizing what we believe makes MetLife unique. We have significantly reduced the capital intensity and market sensitivity of our business. We have built some of the premier insurance franchises in the world. We remain vetted to the true economics of the life insurance business, which is cash. And finally, we have cultivated a culture of relentless focus on efficiency and execution. We recognize that MetLife’s success has set a new higher baseline against which we will be judged. The next 10 yards will not be as easy to gain as the last 10, but we are up for the challenge. Now, I will turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel and good morning. I will start with the 4Q ‘21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in the quarter was $1.2 billion or $662 million lower than adjusted earnings. Net derivative losses were primarily due to the stronger equity markets and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. For the full year, net derivative losses of $1.8 billion primarily due to higher interest rates in 2021 accounted for most of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings. On Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $140 million of notable tax items that were favorable in the fourth quarter of ‘21 and accounted for in Corporate & Other. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $1.7 billion, down 8% and down 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share excluding notable items, was $2.01, down 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and essentially flat on a constant currency basis, aided by capital management. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 95% year-over-year due to unfavorable underwriting margins. I will discuss group life underwriting in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 74.2% in 4Q of ‘21 at the upper end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%, but generally in line given fourth quarter seasonality for dental utilization. That said the ratio was higher than the prior year quarter ratio of 61.7%, which benefited from low dental utilization and favorable disability incidences. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 15% versus 4Q of ‘20 and up 18% for the full year. The strong full year PFO growth of 18% included 6 percentage points, mostly related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. The balance of PFO growth of 12% was at the top end of our low double-digit annual guidance in 2021. This was equally attributable to the addition of Versant Health and solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 18% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income largely due to strong private equity returns. Favorable volume growth also contributed to year-over-year performance. RIS investment spreads were 202 basis points, driven by another strong quarter of variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 91 basis points, down 13 basis points versus 4Q ‘20, primarily due to lower pay-downs in our portfolios of residential mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans. RIS liability exposures increased 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to pension risk transfers, we completed 5 transactions worth $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were up 19% and 21% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as favorable expense margins and volume growth. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and unfavorable underwriting margin due to higher COVID-19-related claims. Asia’s solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management, on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% on a constant currency basis. In addition, sales were up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by growth across most markets. Latin America adjusted earnings were $125 million versus $14 million in the prior year quarter. While COVID-19-related claims remain elevated in 4Q ‘21 at roughly $37 million after tax, they were down significantly versus the prior year quarter and sequentially. In addition, higher recurring interest margins, favorable tax items and volume growth also contributed. Lower Chilean and Kahe returns were a partial offset. Top line continues to demonstrate strength as adjusted PFOs were up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and sales were up 35% on a constant currency basis driven by solid growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 48% and 45% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting from COVID-19 related claims as well as higher expenses and the exclusion of divested businesses in the current year period. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 13%. This increase was primarily driven by higher variable investment income as well as a reduction in policyholder dividend levels. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $177 million, excluding favorable notable items in the quarter versus an adjusted loss of $198 million in the prior year quarter. Higher net investment income and lower taxes were partially offset by higher expenses in the quarter. The company’s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 12% due to several favorable tax items. These include an IRS audit settlement, a release of a deferred tax liability and a true-up associated with the filing of our 2020 corporate tax return. Adjusting for these items, the effective tax rate was within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now, I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the four quarters of 2021, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. The Group Life mortality ratio was 106.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims in 4Q of ‘21 were roughly 18 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $300 million. While U.S. COVID deaths were higher in 4Q versus 3Q, we did see a favorable shift in the percentage of deaths under age 65, declining from approximately 40% in 3Q to roughly 33% in 4Q. As a result, these two competing factors essentially offset. In regard to non-COVID deaths, they were within our normal expected quarterly fluctuations. On Page 6, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2021. VII was $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 7.9% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equity is generally accounted for on a one-quarter lag, while all private equity classes performed well in the quarter. Our venture capital funds, which accounted for roughly 25% of our PE account balance of $14 billion were the strongest performer across sub-sectors, with a roughly 13% quarterly return. For the full year, VII was $5.7 billion, more than 4x above the top end of our 2021 target range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the four quarters and full year 2021. As we had previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly one-third each. For the full year, these three businesses accounted for 92% of the total VII with RIS and MetLife Holdings benefiting from the outperformance from venture capital funds relative to Asia. Turning to Page 8, this chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior eight quarters and full year 2020 and 2021. As expected, our direct expense ratio in 4Q of ‘21 was elevated at 12.9%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs and Group Benefits, timing of certain technology investments and employee costs. That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2021, our direct expense ratio was 11.6%, well below our annual target of less than 12.3%, clearly demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.4 billion at December 31, which was up from $5.1 billion at September 30 and remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In 2021, we returned approximately $6 billion to shareholders, the most in any year through share repurchases and common stock dividends. For the 2-year period 2020 and 2021, our average free cash flow ratio excluding notable items, totaled 59%, while the ratio was below our 65% to 75% target range, due to the strength of our adjusted earnings in 2021. Our statutory free cash flow in absolute dollar terms remains strong. In terms of statutory capital for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2021 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2021 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $5 billion, while net income was approximately $3.8 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $19.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 911% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. Before I shift to our near-term outlook on Page 11, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 16 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife’s major segments from 2016 through 2020. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q ‘21 supplemental slides, but we felt it was worth including again for the sake of completeness. Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, this chart demonstrates that we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. Also Pages 17 through 20 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business. Turning back to Page 11, we expect COVID-19 to remain with us in 2022. But given the uncertainty of the environment, we are not going to speculate on the magnitude or timing. Therefore, our near-term targets do not reflect COVID impacts. Based on 12/31 forward curve, interest rates are expected to rise. However, we would expect favorable impacts to be offset in part by higher LIBOR rates, resulting in a flatter yield curve. FX rates based on the forward curve indicate the U.S. dollar is expected to remain strong, which will be a headwind for our businesses outside the U.S. As a result, we would expect adjusted earnings in 2022 versus 2021, will be reduced by roughly $50 million in Asia, roughly $25 million for both Latin America and EMEA. Finally, we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500 and a 12% annual return for private equity. This is consistent with our historical returns for PE. Moving to near-term targets, we are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 12% to 14%. We also expect to maintain our 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. Given the strong adjusted earnings in 2021, we would expect to be closer to the bottom end of the range in 2021 and 2022 before moving higher in 2022 through 2024. This is just a function of math, given the outsized earnings in 2021 as well as the lagging nature of statutory dividend payments to the holding company. In addition, we remain committed to maintaining a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3%. We are raising our VII guidance in 2022 to $1.8 billion to $2 billion. After applying our historical average returns on higher asset balances, I’ll provide more detail on VII in a moment. Our Corporate & Other adjusted loss is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax but we are increasing our expected effective tax rate by 1 point to 21% to 23% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you’ll see expected key interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, which incorporates the forward curve as of December 31. The takeaway is that changes in interest rates are expected to have a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near-term. Now I’d like to provide you with more detail on what informed our 2022 VII guidance range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, as highlighted on Page 12. The chart reflects the growth in our VII average asset balances from $8.4 billion in 2020 to nearly double at $16.5 billion expected in 2022. This growth is due to both the strong private equity returns in 2021 as well as the inclusion of over $2.6 billion of real estate and other funds in 2021. These were previously part of the recurring investment income portfolio and were reclassed to VII beginning in 2021 as we’ve begun to partially shift the form of our investment in certain asset classes, such as real estate equity investments through participation in funds. In addition, our 2022 average VII asset balance also factors in, our expected sale of $1 billion of private equity in the secondary market in 2022. Finally, in addition to the asset balances, we are applying our historical annual returns for each asset class within VII. In addition to the PE return of 12%, which I previously discussed, we expect 6.5% return for hedge funds and a 7% return for real estate and other funds. So now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Our comments will be anchored our full year 2021 reported results in our QFS, unless otherwise noted. Let’s start with the U.S. on Page 13. For Group Benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating Group Life contracts of $1.1 billion in 2021, adjusted PFOs are expected to resume their historical target range of 4% to 6% annually, albeit from a higher base. Regarding underwriting, we expect the annual Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90% excluding COVID impacts. We are also maintaining the expected group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio at 70% to 75%. For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. However, we are increasing our expected annual RIS investment spread by 5 basis points to 95 to 120 basis points in 2022, consistent with our higher VII range. Overall, we would expect a significant decline in RIS adjusted earnings in 2022, given the exceptional private equity returns in 2021 as well as 2021 benefiting from higher mortgage pay-downs and excess mortality gains, we believe were likely due to COVID. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline between 6% to 8% annually higher than our prior guidance of 5% to 7%. We are lowering the life interest adjusted benefit ratio to 45% to 50% in 2022 from the prior 50% to 55% in 2021 to reflect the impact of lowering the policyholder dividend levels. Finally, we are maintaining the adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2022. Now let’s look at the near-term guidance for our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 14. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid to high single-digit growth over the near-term. In addition, we expect journal account AUM to maintain mid-single-digit growth. We are expecting mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth when excluding the excess VII over plan of approximately $800 million post tax in 2021. In Latin America, we expect adjusted PFOs to grow by high single digits over the near-term. Relative to its 2021 reported adjusted earnings, we expect Latin America adjusted earnings to double in 2022, excluding COVID impacts, and then grow by high single to low double digits in 2023 and 2024. Finally, for EMEA, we expect sales to grow mid to high single-digits over the near-term. We expect adjusted earnings and PFOs to decline in 2022 due to the impact from the stronger U.S. dollar and divestitures in the region. For 2023 and 2024, we expect to me adjusted earnings and PFOs to grow to mid to high single-digits on a constant currency basis. Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter to close out a very strong year, highlighted by outstanding private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I’ll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first, we go to Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to start off on the VII, can you give us a sense of how much of the VII or excess VII came from marks as opposed to realized gains in 2021 and maybe how that would compare to prior years?
Michel Khalaf: Suneet, in general, think about what Michelle said, I mean, over the last – since 2016, basically, we’ve had equal amounts of cash distribution as well as marks. Last year was a little bit more heavily weighted toward marks just given, I think, market returns, but that’s still been the trend. I mean we get a significant amount of cash distributions that I think we wanted to really sort of emphasize that this just isn’t marks.
Suneet Kamath: Got it. Sorry, I missed that. I got on late. And then I guess, for John, on the direct expense ratio, I mean, less than $12.3 million guide. Can we look at 2021, the 11.6% is sort of a reasonable place for this year? And can you talk a little bit about inflationary pressures on your cost base?
John McCallion: Sure, and good morning, Suneet, welcome back. So now overall, I would just say and as we said in prior meetings, I think the in general, the team continues to execute here and it’s really been embedded in our culture from an efficiency mindset perspective. And fourth quarter was elevated. It’s in line with what we expected. We have those seasonal enrollment costs. We had some timing on some investments in technology. And then we did see a creep up in employee costs occur in the quarter. That was that was offset from a ratio perspective by the fact that we did have some elevated participating claims, which impacts PFOs in the group business. And full year, that’s a little over $1 billion, as we mentioned earlier. So you need to – if you think about the full year ratio, you almost need to adjust for that, so maybe 30 basis points normalization. So nonetheless, I mean, still a very healthy margin relative to our 12.3%. And I think as we look forward, we continue to target 12.3%. I mean we do see an inflationary environment ahead of us. We think our – we believe and we expect to still manage within our 12.3%. We think it’s the right target for us. And I think it allows us to utilize our expense leverage to fund investment in growth and technology. If circumstances dictate, we can let some of that leverage fall to the bottom line. And manage the firm that way. But ultimately, this kind of mentality helps us to build our efficiency muscles in the firm. It keeps us away from those disruptive often fleeting big bang expense program. So all in all, we’re still committed to the 12.3% at this point.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks, John. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Thanks. A couple of questions on Group for me. On – first, just on the elevated non-medical health benefit ratio. John, you mentioned, it was mainly dental utilization being higher. How is disability trending also? And taking these together, would you expect 2022 to more likely stay towards the high end of the 70 to 75 guidance range or do you think midpoint is still a good base case?
Ramy Tadros: Hi, Tom, it’s Ramy here. So first of all, with respect to the range, the guidance still remains between 70 to 75. So we’re not changing that range. And as you correctly pointed out, the uptick in this quarter for the ratio was largely driven by the seasonality of the dental claims. I would point out that this is kind of entirely expected as we typically see an increase in the utilization in the fourth quarter was participants and providers look to the annual maximums in mind and essentially look to utilize the benefit. So we typically see that uptick in the fourth quarter with Dental. With respect to disability, I’ll maybe break it down for you into two pieces. First is the long-term disability piece. We did see slightly higher incident rates this quarter compared to historical pre-pandemic norms. This is a slight tick up and well within the range of the normal variations we’ve seen around these claims. At the same time, for long-term disability, we continue to see pretty strong offsets with respect to recoveries, which are also trending higher than the historical norms. So that’s kind of the long-term piece on this ability. The short-term disability piece, we have seen a rise in COVID claims in the quarter. And we’ve also seen a rise in some non-covered incidents, which rise in pregnancies as an example. But however, the financial impact on our bottom line from the STD block is really small, and that’s driven by the relative size of the STD block. It’s about third of our overall disability block as well as the mix of our STD business, where half of the block by live is ASO business where we’re not on the hook for the claims. So all in all, when you just step back from a disability perspective, while we’ve seen that small increase in the LTD levels, we are not seeing any evidence of a trend here at this point, but we clearly continue to watch this very carefully.
Tom Gallagher: Got it. Thanks, Ramy. And just a follow-up, so a number of peers are showing weak group sales this quarter, Met seems to be holding up better. Can you talk a little bit about pricing and what you’re seeing competitive-wise right now, whether are you getting rate in low of recent results or are you holding the line on pricing and opting for growth?
Ramy Tadros: Tom. I’ll start off with sales and then give you some color on the pricing side. So first of all, I would say we’re extremely pleased with the sales in ‘21. They’re record sales for us, and that’s something we’re very happy about. If you look at the composition of those sales, we’ve had positive momentum across all of our products and markets. But what really stood out in ‘21 is the main driver of the increase in sales was the jumbo end of the market. And remember, this is the higher end of our national accounts business. So different companies define that differently, but our national accounts business comprise employers with 5,000-plus employees, and this is at the higher end of that segment. Those sales came from across the entire portfolio of products across core and voluntary. The other kind of color I’d give you here is that almost 90% of those jumbo sales came from our existing customers. So these are customers who have been with us for years and in some instances, decades. And the other thing I’d point out on sales here, and we’ve discussed this in the past, this jumbo end of the market is a part of the market where price is not the sole determining factor for winning the business. There are a lot of non-price elements here, such as service, administration, capabilities, etcetera, that are an important part of the decision-making. And then maybe the last piece on sales is those jumbo sales can be lumpy. And as we look forward into ‘22, we are seeing less movement in the jumbo market. And so we are expecting that activity to come down in ‘22 from a jumbo perspective. So, that’s kind of a bit of a color on sales. With respect to pricing, I would make a few points. One is that we have had an approach that’s been disciplined and consistent in the market. We have had a very long track record of being disciplined. And a big part of that is working closely with our customers and intermediaries to ensure that they understand our actions and they are transparent and understood in the marketplace. And that’s been true over the last year. So, we have been implementing a range of price increases across life and disability blocks commensurate with our profitability target and commensurate with our views on near and medium-term mortality as well as their views on employment and rates. And the data point I would give you here with respect to pricing, if you look at the 1/1 renewal season, we have been able to achieve our desired margin for those renewals, and we have maintained strong persistency in our book. And so our view is that the market is generally absorbing those price increases, and you do see that in the PFO number that we have posted. And at the end of the day, another kind of point for you on the discipline is our guidance ranges for both mortality and non-medical health ratios, which kind of remain unchanged into ‘22.
Tom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks for all that color.
Operator: And next, we have a question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Yes. Good morning. So, just a question on interest rates, and you touched on this a little bit in your comments as well. But how do you think about the benefit of rising interest rates based on what the forward yield curve is predicting right now being sort of negated by and just a likely flatter yield curve. And if you could just discuss what are the businesses that would be most affected by that dynamic. But how much of the benefit of rates would actually be taken away by a flatter yield curve?
John McCallion: Good morning Jimmy, it’s John. So, I think the – and you can see it in our sensitivities at the bottom of the first page and the outlook. We are generally still a net positive to rising rates and the curve is flattening in the base case, right. And that’s based on the forward curve as of 12/31. But it’s – as we talked about, our sensitivity is much less these days. So, it’s a modest benefit. And then you have to kind of look deeper into why rates are rising. I think there is a number of things around like inflationary pressures, is that it and what the other drivers are. So, just on an interest rate perspective, as we – as I said in my opening remarks, the higher rates are positive, and they are partially offset by the fact that the curve is flattening. And partly – you can see that a little bit in, say, the RIS spreads as they emerge in 2022. That’s one of the drivers for why they would come down. The ex-VII spreads would come down off of ‘21, not the only one, but one of them. And then I think just holistically on – as you think about what could drive if it’s inflationary pressures, and that could be another thing for consideration. I think again, we are probably a net neutral to positive on inflationary pressures. If you think about our businesses and certainly the group business and is probably a net positive, what also could it be a GDP growth along with that. So, a number of different factors that go into it. But all-in-all, I would say just the short answer to the question would be kind of a modest positive for rising rates.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And if I just ask one more on just dental usage, when COVID had initially hit obviously dental usage had dropped a lot. It doesn’t seem like this anecdotally, that that’s happening with the Omicron surge that we have seen recently, which if it was happening, obviously, I think it would show up in 1Q. But have you seen a similar decline in usage in dental with the surge in claims that we have seen or surge in cases that we have seen over the past 1.5 months?
Ramy Tadros: Jimmy, it’s Ramy. I think the big driver in the beginning of the pandemic was the actual closure of the dental offices. So, you have got – that was – just the offices were not open. Now clearly, there was also some sort of hesitancy on the part of people to go out as well. I would say at this point, the dental offices are open, and it’s pretty much a return to normal kind of outcome in terms of the utilization patterns that we are seeing in dental.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we have a question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on holdings. You guys provided pretty stable earnings outlook this year with what you had expected at the start of last year. And I know in the past, you guys have mentioned the cash flow being generated by the business is a reason that you kind of counterbalance against potentially entering into a risk transfer transaction. Can you just provide an update on your thoughts relative to transactions within the blocks within holdings? And if perhaps the rising rate environment increases your prospects of entering into a deal?
John McCallion: Good morning Elyse, it’s John. I think in terms of the kind of the back end of your question and risk transfers, I would say nothing has really changed. I think from the comments we gave in the third quarter, we are continuing to kind of stick with our primary objectives of optimizing the business, meeting customer obligations and continuing to look for further efficiencies as the block runs off. And at the same time, we are taking a third-party perspective of this block. I would say – and I think I mentioned this in the third quarter. I think the environment has continued to be robust. Interest rates rising would be another positive factor, I think in doing a transaction like that, that would be value creative and maybe helps close the bid-ask spread. So, that’s probably a consideration. I think as you pointed out in the kind of the first part of your question around MetLife Holdings. It’s been a resilient runoff. It’s probably a way to comment on that maybe better than we thought. And obviously, I think that’s hats off to the team and the efforts that they have made on different actions on optimizing the business and really doing well on expenses. And in addition, we did – I did comment on lower policyholder dividend levels that does have an impact. It’s impacting the ratio and that’s helping kind of keep earnings up as well as just the higher equity market. So, there is just a variety of factors that have allowed for a stable outlook in terms of earnings range. But – so we feel very good about it, but it’s just a number of items that’s kind of getting us there. I think that’s how I would summarize it.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question, you guys called out – you guys said you didn’t see any excess mortality within getaway from COVID. I was just hoping to just get some more color there. I know we have seen some companies that flagged elevated mortality. I just wanted to get additional color on what you are seeing in your book? Thank you.
Ramy Tadros: Hi Elyse, it’s Ramy here. So, as you heard in our prepared remarks, the COVID-specific impact was 18 points and just to be really clear about the definition of that, these are deaths where COVID is marked as the actual cause of death. What we do every quarter as part of our analysis is we look at additional excess mortality, which appears to be COVID-driven. And so what I mean by that are increases in death reasons that kind of are related to perhaps heart or lung disease. And for this quarter, that appears to be about another point as well. Now that has come down from prior quarters, where it was hovering in the kind of 2%, 2.5% range. So, there is, call it, another point of what appears to be COVID in the results for this quarter.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Hi. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit more about the free cash flow outlook? And given the lagged impact of statutory ordinary dividends that you mentioned, should we expect a higher level of cash flow coming through in 2022 on a dollar basis?
John McCallion: Good morning Erik, it’s John. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think that’s a good way to put it. Certainly, this year, as I mentioned earlier, it’s simply math, outsized earnings. Free cash flow was at or above actually expectations for us. And then – but the ratio is a bit down. But the expectation – and you can think of it, it’s $1 billion roughly, give or take, right. If you think about the middle of the range and we would expect that to come in over the next year or 2 years. So all-in-all, we would expect a higher level in ‘22 and ‘23.
Erik Bass: Great. Thank you. And then just a question on VII and I guess as you are thinking about the sizing of your alternatives portfolio over time. And certainly, it’s been an important contributor to results and the portfolio continues to grow, but is there just kind of a limit on kind of where you would want that to get to as a percentage of investments and how are you thinking about managing that and the ability to grow it further?
Steven Goulart: Hi, it’s Steve. And I will refer to John’s comment during the outlook about the sale of $1 billion of PE interest. What I would say on it is this is part of our normal investment process. And part of that was a consideration of the size of the alternatives portfolio as well. It does have a valuable position in the portfolio from an ALM perspective. As far as hedging long-term tails go equity is very valuable in that respect. But again, we have seen a run up, obviously, in the last couple of years in the PE portfolio, particularly. And so part of our overall process is continuing to evaluate the exposures, and that’s what’s led to the decision to go forward with that sale. So, I think that’s reflective of how our process works and how we – how we will continue to look at our overall asset allocation and particularly the VII and alternatives.
Erik Bass: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we have a question from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hi. Good morning. Could you give a little bit more color on how you expect the RIS spread, excluding VII to trend in 2022?
John McCallion: Hi Ryan, it’s John. Good morning. So yes, I would say, so full year ‘21 spreads were 229. And with excess VII spread around 93 bps, so 136 bps contribution from VII. And so as we talked about focusing on the ex-VII spread, it’s been elevated pay-down activity on our residential mortgage loans and securities portfolio. We also saw a pretty sizable drop during the course of the year in LIBOR, right. And so when you look forward, we are assuming holistically, obviously, private equity returns get more in line with our historical average. The pay-down activity continues to moderate, LIBOR rises. And so therefore, all-in, we would expect that RIS spread, as we talked about to be $95 million to $120 million. And then just on – going back to the ex-VII, we should expect like sequentially because of the last two factors I mentioned, it lead to like a 5 basis point to 7 basis point drop sequentially from where we are today, and maybe for full year, so call it a 7 basis points to 9 basis point drop versus ‘21.
Ryan Krueger: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott: Hi. One of the things that caught my eye in the outlook was just a pretty strong anticipated recovery in LatAm and pretty strong growth in the out years. So, I was just interested if you could talk about what some of the drivers are there and some of the things you are doing as part of that horizon strategy to give you the confidence in that growth?
Eric Clurfain: Yes. Sure, Alex. Hi, this is Eric. Thanks for the question. Let me focus on a couple of things. If you think about our top line and what we have seen in 2021, we have achieved really a great momentum across the region. Sales reached a pre-pandemic level – levels in the third quarter. And then again, in the fourth quarter, our persistency has also been very resilient and above expectations across most markets. And coupled with the strong sales has really delivered a strong and solid PFO growth in 2021. And when we are seeing this, we are confident to see this moving forward, that momentum to continue. And that demonstrates really the strength, the diversity and the resiliency of our distribution channels and product mix, right. So, if you combine this with the swift implementation of several digital capabilities in our largest markets. That allows us to service our customers faster and better and to be more efficient. So, all-in-all, this highlights the underlying fundamentals of the franchise and the strength and the view in the view that once the pandemic returns to normal, and the pandemic recedes, our earnings run rate also will return to normal. And to John’s point on outlook, we expect earnings to double, excluding COVID next year.
Alex Scott: Thank you.
Operator: And next, we will move on to Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Lee: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I have a follow-up question on VII. Just looking at the outperformance to-date and just this year alone, you had over $4 billion above your plan. How should we think about the impact of the strong appreciation on your capital going forward? You talked about doing a secondary sales this year for $1 billion, which would be one way to monetize it. But if I were to think about the increasing carrying value of these assets on a statutory basis, it should help your capital base even with the high risk charge. So, maybe just can you talk about the capital implication of the strong VII to-date?
John McCallion: Hi, good morning Humphrey, it’s John. So, I think you have articulated it well that we are getting a benefit of the strong appreciation in our capital levels. I mean we talked about – we expect to be above 360%. I mean I would say, yes, that will definitely be the case. And I think you can see that in some of the statistics I gave in the earlier part around just growth in TAC. In terms of how you monetize that from a dividend perspective, I would say the sale doesn’t really change that, right? Just kind of monetizes the unrealized to realized, if you think about that $1 billion. And then the way this gets monetized through status is through growth in earnings, which comes through in cash just if we are going to get into a little bit of accounting. It’s the cash distributions that come through as well as we have kind of a greater of test with regards to a percent of surplus versus earnings. So, just if surplus is greater than – and that apply that percentage that will be another way you can kind of realize that through dividends.
Humphrey Lee: Got it. And then just to follow-up your earlier comment about the free cash flow conversion should trend higher kind of in ‘22 through ‘24. As I think about these kind of VII cash flow come through on a LACT basis. Like should we actually think about the free cash flow conversion could be towards the upper end or even maybe above your guided range kind of over the next several years as some of these cash flows come through?
Michel Khalaf: Yes. So we – remember, we give our guidance ranges on a 2-year average. And just because of this lumpiness as we were basically talking about, right. And so I think you are referencing kind of on a 1-year basis. And so certainly, that’s why we use an average. When we think about that 65% incentive, so it’s a little lower this quarter, I mean this year, on an annual basis, we would expect it to be higher next year. And then on average, get us back into the range, maybe at the low end as we do our math. But I think you have articulated the direction correctly.
Humphrey Lee: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for no further questions. I will now turn the call back to the CEO, Michel Khalaf. Please go ahead.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, operator. At our Investor Day in December 2019, we said and I quote, MetLife is a simpler and more focused company with a great set of businesses that generate strong free cash flow. That is more true than ever. And as we enter 2022, we do so with a high degree of confidence that we will continue to create value for our stakeholders. Thank you for joining us this morning, and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-04 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday’s earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife’s SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. The floor is yours, sir.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides which address third quarter results. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features additional disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As I reflect on the journey MetLife has been on these past two years, I am more convinced than ever that we are focused on what matters most. We are a purpose-driven company at a time when stakeholders will accept nothing less. We have the right strategy to see us through even the most turbulent environments, and we have a strong culture of execution that gives our shareholders confidence. All of these attributes were on display in the third quarter of 2021. Starting with our financial results. Adjusted earnings were $2.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.39, up 38% year-over-year. Excluding total notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 24% and adjusted EPS was up 31%. Looking at the quarterly performance of the enterprise as a whole, variable investment income was outstanding, underlying PFOs were strong and expense disciplined held firm. The main area where we have seen headwinds is from elevated COVID claims. In key respects, the third quarter of 2021 looks very much like the first quarter with exceptionally strong VII more than offsetting excess mortality. On the investment side, our private equity portfolio returned $1.5 billion in Q3, its highest quarterly contribution in 2021 and the major contributor to VII, which was well above the top end of our implied quarterly guidance range. On underwriting in our U.S. business, the Group Life mortality ratio was elevated at 106.2% in Q3 on higher claim severity and frequency due to a shift younger in the age distribution of COVID deaths. Our Latin America business incurred COVID losses of $137 million in Q3. Two aspects of our underwriting results are noteworthy. From a social perspective, paying COVID claims is precisely how life insurance companies make a positive difference in the world. The human toll of the pandemic on families is catastrophic but where life insurance is present, the financial burden is eased. This is our purpose to help prepare the financial damage after lives most destabilizing moments. Pandemic to date, in our U.S. group business, we've incurred U.S. life claims of around $2.1 billion. Life insurance is not like other businesses where losses are just losses. Every underwriting claim represents a beneficiary who is receiving the financial help they were promised. From a financial perspective, even though our Life businesses have been hit with the most severe pandemic in more than 100 years, they remain profitable. MetLife has actually paid out more in COVID-related claims in 2021 than we did in 2020. And yet, our adjusted earnings per share are higher this year than last year, as is our adjusted return on equity. What has enhanced MetLife's capacity to pay outsized claims while still generating exceptional earnings is our of our strategic decision to allocate a prudent portion of our investment portfolio to private equity. While not a direct COVID offset, the valuation of our PE and VC funds with significant technology exposure has benefited from global capital flows to this growth sector. The return on our PE portfolio in the quarter was an outstanding 12.6% and stands at approximately 36% year-to-date. The gains on our well-seasoned portfolio are not mere accounting marks. Year-to-date, we have received $1.9 billion in cash distributions from RPE funds. Since 2016, the figure is $7.6 billion. While we often reinvest the e-cash proceeds as funds mature and terminate, the cash generated is steady and significant. Turning to the underlying performance of MetLife's businesses, we are seeing solid momentum. In U.S. Group Benefits, adjusted PFOs grew 13% year-over-year, excluding Versant Health PFO growth was 6.2% on strong jumbo sales and persistency, and we expect to end the year near the top end of our guidance range. In voluntary benefits, which for us consists of accident and health, legal plans and pet insurance, we saw strong double-digit PFO growth in the third quarter. The trend in sales is even stronger. Year-to-date, sales are up 40% over the prior period, and we remain on track for a record sales year. While group sales can fluctuate from year-to-year due to jumbo cases, we believe the robust U.S. job market and the competition for talent are creating a strong tailwind. In connection with open enrollment season this fall, we conducted consumer research on benefit preferences among millennials, who are now the largest age group cohort in the U.S. with more than 70 million members. Millennials are expressing strong interest in both traditional benefits such as life insurance and dental and involuntary benefits such as legal plans and pet insurance. Another top desire is for help with financial planning. MetLife entered the space in late September with a digital financial wellness tool called Upwise, which helps us connect with employees directly. The app is designed to address the emotional barriers to financial progress and help people tackle death, save more or even create a digital will. Within our RIS business, after a quiet first three quarters, we have already booked four cases totaling $3.5 billion of pension risk transfer deals in the first month of the fourth quarter. Next Tuesday marks the 100th anniversary of the first group annuity contract MetLife ever wrote with the William Rodge printing company. We are pleased to be a leader in the business of helping companies honor the retirement promises they have made to their workers. Last month, MetLife released the results of our annual pension risk transfer pull. We only survey companies that want to derisk. Of the 253 respondents, nearly 7 in 10 have pension plan assets of $5 00 million or more and 93% intend to divest all of the defined benefit pension liabilities at some point in the future, up from 76% in 2019. Elsewhere in RIS, excluding PRTs from both periods, adjusted PFOs were up 70% year-over-year. There were two main drivers. The first was longevity reinsurance, a market we entered in the UK last year. The second was post-retirement benefits, where we take on blocks of retiree life insurance from employers. This is an attractive adjacency to our group business that plays to MetLife's competitive advantages. In Latin America, we delivered exceptional sales growth in the quarter, up 45% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In fact, sales were higher in Q3 2021 than they were in Q3 2019 before the COVID pandemic began. In most markets across the region, we saw double-digit growth in both sales and PFOs. Moving to cash and capital, MetLife ended the third quarter with $5.1 billion of cash at its holding companies. During the quarter, we paid $400 million in common stock dividends and repurchased $1 billion worth of outstanding common shares with another 233 million repurchased so far in Q4. We have $2.5 billion remaining on the $3 billion share repurchase authorization we announced in August. We are on track to return more than $5.5 billion of capital to shareholders in 2021, and we continue to strive for a balanced mix between business investment and capital return. In 2020, for example, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders and invested approximately $5 billion in organic growth and M&A. Our test for capital deployment remains consistent. Does it clear our risk-adjusted hurdle rate? As John will describe in greater detail, the new business we wrote in 2020, a period when interest rates were at all-time lows, was the most attractive of the past five years. It had the shortest payback period, the highest internal rate of return and the highest value of new business relative to the amount of capital deployed. This was the natural outgrowth of our Accelerating Value initiative. By optimizing our portfolio of businesses, shifting our product mix to be more capital efficient and fully embracing an efficiency mindset, we have consistently improved VNB over time, and it is now an integral part of our capital allocation process. This year, in addition to organic growth, we increased the stake in our India joint venture, PNB MetLife to 47% from 32%. India is one of the five secular growth markets we identified in our Next Horizon strategy. Consistent with that strategy, we are increasing our exposure to a market where PNB MetLife has access to more than 200 million customers across 15,000 sales locations. In September, we held an in-depth session with our Board of Directors to pressure test every aspect of our Next Horizon strategy. We've done this each year of my tenure as CEO. As representatives of our shareholders and shareholders themselves, our Board challenged us to make sure we are positioned and on track to deliver on our goals. I believe the alignment between the Board and management is as strong as it's ever been, and our shared commitments remain clear, focus on deploying capital to its best use, simplify the company to improve efficiency and the customer experience and truly differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. Now I'll turn it over to John for a detailed review of our quarterly performance.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll start with the 3Q 2021 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, details of our annual global actuarial assumption review and updates on our value of new business metrics and our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings. Net income in the third quarter was $1.5 billion or $541 million lower than adjusted earnings. Net derivative losses of $172 million were primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. In addition, our actuarial assumption review accounted for $76 million of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings. In total, the assumption review reduced net income by $216 million, including a notable item to adjusted earnings of $140 million. The table on Page 4 provides highlights of the actuarial assumption review with the breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business segment. We have kept our U.S. mean reversion interest rate unchanged at 2.75% and maintain our long-term mortality assumptions despite the near-term impacts from COVID-19. Most of the net income impact was in MetLife Holdings and Asia. For MetLife Holdings, the primary driver was a refinement to the variable annuity lapse rate function to better reflect policyholder behavior based on withdrawal status. In Asia, the largest impact was due to the lowering of the earned rate assumption in Japan, where we assume current earned rates for our long-term rate assumption. On Page 5, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $2.2 billion, up 24% and up 23% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by strong returns in our private equity portfolio. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $2.56, up 31% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis, aided by capital management. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S.. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 72% year-over-year, driven by unfavorable underwriting margins in Group Life, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 70.7% in 3Q of 2021 at the low-end of its annual target range of 70% to 75% but higher than the prior year quarter of 67.4%, which benefited from extremely low dental utilization and favorable disability incidents. Volume growth, the addition of Versant Health and favorable expense margins were partial offsets to the decline in year-over-year results. Group Benefits continues to have strong top line growth. Year-to-date sales were up 40%, primarily due to higher jumbo case activity. Adjusted PFOs in the quarter were up 13% year-over-year, driven by solid volume growth across most products, including voluntary and the addition of Versant Health. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings, were up 60% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, largely due to strong private equity returns. Favorable underwriting margins and volume growth also contributed to year-over-year performance. RIS investment spreads were 256 basis points, up 100 basis points year-over-year due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 93 basis points, down 5 basis points year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to lower paydowns in our portfolios of residential mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans. RIS liability exposures including UK longevity reinsurance increased 4% year-over-year due to solid volume growth across the product portfolio. With regards to pension risk transfers, as Michelle noted, we have already completed $3.5 billion of transactions in the fourth quarter and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 31% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Asia's solid volume growth also contributed to the strong performance, driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% on a constant currency basis. Lower accident and health utilization in the prior period was a partial offset. Asia sales were down 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting pressure from COVID-related lockdowns in the region. Asia year-to-date sales were up 10% on a constant currency basis and remain on target to achieve double-digit growth in 2021. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 35% and down 38% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting margins due to elevated COVID-19-related claims, mainly in Mexico. The impact to Latin America's third quarter adjusted earnings was approximately $137 million. While the situation remains fluid, we have seen COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths in Latin America significantly declined in October. Favorable investment in expense margins as well as lower taxes versus the prior year quarter were partial offsets. While Latin America's adjusted earnings have been pressured by elevated COVID-19-related claims, sales and persistency throughout the region remains strong. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 22% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 45% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across most markets. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 20% on both a reported and constant currency basis primarily driven by volume growth across the region and favorable underwriting margins, primarily in the Gulf. We expect EMEA adjusted earnings to decline in the fourth quarter due to the timing of certain technology investments across the region. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 2% on a constant currency basis and sales were down 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting divested businesses, partially offset by growth in Turkey and Europe. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings, excluding notable items in both periods, were up $271 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. Underwriting margins did reflect higher life claims severity than expected during the third quarter of 2021. However, the Life interest adjusted benefit ratio of 53.3% was within our annual target range of 50% to 55%. In addition, LTC new claims returned to more normal levels in the quarter versus very low new claims submissions in the prior year quarter. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million in both periods. Lower tax benefits were mostly offset by higher net investment income year-over-year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20.6% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now I'll provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 6. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the first three quarters of 2021, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. Group Life mortality ratio is 106.2% in the third quarter of 2021, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims in 3Q of 2021 were roughly 18 percentage points which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $290 million. The primary drivers were higher claim frequency and severity. Approximately 40% of U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter were under age 65, about double the rate of the first quarter of this year and the highest percentage in any quarter since the pandemic began and therefore, having a greater proportional impact on the working age population. In addition, we estimate that the quarter included roughly 1 to 2 incremental percentage points impact on the mortality ratio from claims that appear to be COVID-related but were not specifically identified as COVID on the death certificate. Despite the impact from COVID, Group Benefits remains a profitable and growing business for MetLife. Group Benefits reported adjusted earnings of roughly $450 million year-to-date and adjusted PFO growth of 13%. Now let's turn to Page 7. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income over the last five quarters, including approximately $1.8 billion in the third quarter. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio which had a 12.6% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, the private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag. While all private equity asset classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 23% of our PE account balance of $12.8 billion. We're the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 18% quarterly return. Page 8 highlights VII by segment for the first three quarters of 2021, including $1.4 billion post tax in the third quarter. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As we have previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings, and Asia generally account for 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly one-third each, although it can vary from quarter to quarter. The VII results in the quarter were more heavily weighted towards RIS and MetLife Holdings, as Asia's private equity portfolio is less mature and has a smaller proportion of venture capital funds I referenced earlier. Turning to Page 9, this chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters and full year 2020, including 11.1% in the third quarter of 2021. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our third quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. This did include approximately 20 basis points from premiums that relate to participating cases and 20 basis points from a single premium Group Life sale in RIS. In addition, the impact from seasonal enrollment costs and timing of certain technology investments are expected to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. Therefore, we do expect the direct expense ratio to be elevated in 4Q. Now, let's turn to Page 10. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past five years, including an update for 2020. Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. As evidence of that commitment, MetLife invested $3.2 billion of capital in 2020 to support new business, which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of six years. New business written in 2020 reflects our disciplined approach to building profitable growth, while creating value, generating cash, and mitigating risk. Despite the sales challenges in 2020 associated with lockdowns related to the pandemic, we were able to increase our value of new business and IRR, while lowering our cash payback period versus 2019. Now, I'll discuss our cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $5.1 billion as of September 30th, which is down from $6.5 billion at June 30th, but still well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies include the net effects of share repurchases of $1 billion, payment of our common stock dividend of roughly $400 million, subsidiary dividends, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we had a long-term debt repayment of $500 million in the third quarter. Our next long-term debt maturity is not until September 2023. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4 billion, while net income was approximately $3 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by higher variable investment income and lower variable annuity right of reserves. Year-to-date 2021 net income increased by, roughly $400 million as compared to the first nine months of 2020. The primary drivers were higher operating earnings and net investment gains which was partially offset by derivative losses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.7 billion as of September 30th, 2021, up 16% compared to December 31st, 2020. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 960%, as of June 30th, which is the latest public data. In summary, MetLife delivered another very strong quarter, driven by exceptional private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. While earnings power of our group benefits in Latin America businesses, has been dampened by COVID-19 excess mortality. We are pleased with the momentum behind these market-leading franchises. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ryan Krueger of KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on your group non-medical health claim trends in the quarter. I guess, in particular, and I know disability is a bit smaller for you, but some companies have had weaker disability results and it sounds like yours held up pretty well. So I appreciate any detail you could provide here.
Ramy Tadros: Good morning Ryan. It's Ramy here. So on the disability front, as you noted, it's - relative to our premium, it's about 12% of our overall PFOs in group. And I can give you some color based on both the LTD and the STD portions of the book. So for the LTD side, what we saw is an incidence rate this quarter that's much more in line with our historical norms. It was higher than last year but last year was a favorable incidence here from a disability perspective. So we're seeing it tick back to where it was historically from a frequency perspective. And then, the recoveries continue to be pretty strong. The other thing I would add there on the LTD side is so far, we have not seen any significant impact on the business from kind of COVID or non-COVID effect, neither have we seen any material impacts from the overall economy. So it's been pretty much a return to, call it, a pre-pandemic levels as far as the LTD book. For the STD side, it's a bit different. So think about that 12% of disability premium, two-thirds of it is sitting in the LTD only a third of it sits in the STD. And then for that one-third that's in STD, about half of those employees are comprised of ASO only business. So we are administering the disability claims but not on the hook for the actual claims themselves. So while for the STD portion, we have seen and continue to see elevated STD COVID claims. The actual impact on the non-medical health ratio is pretty de minimis given the composition of our book and the ASO exposure.
Ryan Krueger: Great. That was helpful. Thank you. And then you've had some benefit from RMBS paydowns in RIS. How should we think about the ongoing impact of that? Or what's left of it from here?
John McCallion: Good morning, Ryan. It's John. Yes, obviously, RIS spreads, I think, overall, have been just a beneficiary of just the excellent performance here in private equity portfolio. So we saw that continue in this quarter. You're referencing, after excluding VII, that spreads have remained resilient at 93 basis points, although a 5 basis point decline from second quarter. But pretty much in line with what we what we set back 90 days ago. So you're referencing that continued alleviated levels paydown activity on the residential mortgage book, and that accelerates the income from those securities or loans that we purchased at a discount. But as we said, we believe we've seen the peak of that. And so that 5 basis point run-off was generally expected. We would expect that to continue into 4Q and kind of start to make its way down. And - but I think kind of a similar trajectory seems reasonable at this point.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: So we've seen more in-force block transactions over the past quarter with sellers getting pretty attractive multiples. And it seems like there's plenty of buyer interest in the types of liabilities you have, and now there are some potential counterparties that have New York entities. So I'm curious if you're getting more optimistic about finding a transaction that could potentially unlock value in portions of your MetLife Holdings blocks?
John McCallion: Eric, it's John. I'd say the short answer is, yes. If the question is, are we getting more optimistic? Yes. We are seeing what you're referencing as well. I think the supplier and buyer base is continuing to remain, I'd say, robust. And I think our team continues to work and take a third-party view and do the analytics around our portfolio. And as we've - I've talked about before, quite a bit of it is thinking about what are of interest of different buyers. It differs. Not everyone is thinking the same way or have they - buyers have different tools for creating value. And so we have to think through that and think about our situation as well and how we would optimize from our end. And I think there is a puzzle to put together there to think through how to best optimize a situation like that. As we've talked about before, we're not going to do something at any cost. But we are continuing to look at things to optimize and accelerate the release of reserves and capital appropriately. And I think that's - we're still on track with that.
Erik Bass: Great, thank you. And then second, I was hoping you could give some perspective on what's going on in Chile and the potential implications for your business. I guess specifically, what are the different proposals that are out there for the AFP system from the leading presidential candidates. And do you see risk of significant change to that business following the election? And also hoping you could talk about the early annuity payouts issues that's been covered in the press and whether that's material for you at all.
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Hi, Erik. It's Michel here. So let me give you some comments and then we'll see if Eric would want to add anything. The pension system in Chile has been subject to public debate for a number of years now, I would say, and that debate tends to heat up around elections. One thing I would say is that despite the general perception, to the contrary, if you think about the pension system, I mean, it's functioned quite well and the returns have been quite good as well for the industry as a whole. The problem with the system is that due to inconsistent contributions, the fact that you have widespread and formal labor in Chile and contribution rates are low. That's led to sort of low projected replacement rates at retirement. The debate is continuing now with presidential elections, round one is in late November and then you'll have the second round in December, and different candidates are taking very different views. Some are supportive of the system, others are in favor of radical reform. So we'd have to see how that plays out. The other thing that's happening in Chile is that there is a re-drafting of the constitution that's taking place that's going to play out next year as well. So we'll see what comes out of that. We are very much engaged with the local authorities. We have great relationships in Chile, we are a leading player there, as you know. We're also in collaboration with the industry, making sure that our point of view is being heard, and hopefully, addressed as well. And look, we are - we are not - we in favor of reform that makes sense for the participants in the system, that protects them, their retirement. But we are also cautioning against any measures that ultimately would do - would damage today's capital markets, as well as investor perceptions of the Chilean - Chile as an investment destination. So we continue to be engaged. As you know, there has been three rounds of withdrawals already. There is another proposal for a fourth round of pension withdrawals. We'll see whether that gets surpassed or not. Clearly, if it does, whereas these withdrawals don't have a material impact on earnings, the damage sort of the viability of the system, if you like, which is something that we advocate against. And then on the annuities front that you referenced, this - there's been one withdrawal there. Again, we don't know if there'll be another one. I think probably our view is that the likelihood of that is not very high, but we'll have to wait and see. All-in-all, our pension business is 2% of MetLife's overall earnings. But our view is that we continue to engage, we continue to keep a close eye on the situation, and we'll have to see how this plays out over the coming weeks and months. Anything to add, Eric?
Eric Clurfain: No. I think you covered it.
Michel Khalaf: So I hope that gives you sort of - that answer to the question, Erik.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
Jimmy Bhullar: Just had a question on the group business. If you can talk about what you're seeing in terms of claims utilization, both frequency and severity in your dental book?
Ramy Tadros: Sure, Jimmy. It's Ramy here. I would say the dental story is very much a return to pre-pandemic utilization. So if you look at the quarter-over-quarter results, 2020 was exceptionally low in terms of dental utilization. We've seen that come back to normal levels. Q3 tends to be seasonally lower. So Q4 tends to kind of slightly tick up typically in terms of the dental business. So very much kind of a return to normal. And I would say if you look at the overall ratio, our non-medical health ratio. And our expectation right now is that for the full year, we're going to get a ratio that's very close to the midpoint of our range.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on the accounting changes, can you talk about where you are internally on sort of the process of figuring out what the impact will be on MetLife? And then relatedly, when do you think you'll start quantifying the impact and sharing it with the investment community?
John McCallion: Good morning, Jimmy, it's John. We are well underway on our implementation work, progress continues. And I'd say, continue to be on target for implementation come 11/23. We're going to - we're in the process of evaluating transition amounts and ongoing impacts of the new guidance. And I'd say our plan is still intact, which would be kind of a mid-2022 timeframe, give or take, for disclosing and kind of sharing how to think about the transition and the insights you should draw upon this. Again, I'd remind everyone that ultimately economics, cash flow, pricing product does not change. And I think we're working well with the industry to think through how we collectively transition ourselves and kind of explain the results. And I think that's going well. So at this point, I'd say nothing has caused us to feel the need to change the time line.
Jimmy Bhullar: And have you had conversations with the rating agencies on how they would view, obviously, they focus on cash flows and stat as well but they do look at cap also. But do you think there will be changes because a lot of your GAAP ratios would obviously end up changing once the rules are implemented.
John McCallion: Yes. We've had periodic discussions with them over time. I think the rating agencies get it, and not everything is changing. So when you say ratios, not all ratios are changing. I mean our group business ratios won't change. So I think it's not all businesses. It's not all products. And I think it's - there will be certain unique circumstances that will arise in certain books. But in general, I think my assessment is that - they have a very balanced methodical way of thinking about it, and they recognize the fact that economics, cash flow and pricing of products is not changing.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Tom Gallagher of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Good morning, John. Just a follow-up on Erik's question on risk transfer. Would you say is - are variable annuities the priority or you're looking broader that might include life insurance and fixed annuities. And just a related question, does your New York domicile limit the types of counterparties that you might transact with? Or would you say it's still a pretty robust list as you're thinking about things that would be in a potential auction bidding situation?
John McCallion: Good morning, Tom. I would say the answer to the first question would be would be, we're open to all blocks of business that create value for us. So I think a lot of different aspects go into value creation when it comes to that question. So I don't think it's one focus there or another. I'd say probably the only one that could probably scope out or say is less likely as LTC just given where bid spreads are at these days. But I'd say markets are evolving on all the other ones. And then you have to look at your own kind of situation to think about the benefits we get from having them in our New York domiciled entity. And so that's how we would kind of frame it. I wouldn't exclude anything outside of, let's say, LTC just given where I think pricing is, there's a pretty big divergence in what people think at this point. On the other aspect of counterparty, I would say, we come at it probably the same way that our New York domicile partners would come at it as well. So I don't know if it changes who or how we would do transaction. I think we probably take somewhat of a similar construct because at the end of the day, our situation would be a reinsurance transaction from the New York domiciled entity. And so credit risk would matter. And so structure can help with that as well. But I don't think it excludes anything per se, but that would be a strong consideration.
Tom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks. And then just one quick one. Long-term care claims, you said, returned to more normal levels this quarter. Was that on both claim frequency and severity? And the reason I ask is, there's clearly, from what we've heard from other has been a shift away from facility care to home health care, which has lowered severity. I'm just curious, if you have that level of detail for how that's trending right now?
John McCallion: Yes, sure. Good question, Tom, because you're right. It has shifted. I mean, quite honestly, every metric has shifted back to pre-pandemic levels. I mean maybe we're off slightly on the relationship of in-home versus kind of external care, but it's very close. It's much - it's very close to being pre-pandemic.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Humphrey Lee of Dowling Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Lee: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Related to EMEA, you talked about there are some favorable items in the quarter and expect fourth quarter to trend down along with some of the high expenses. Is there any way to help us think about what would be the kind of the run rate earnings for EMEA? 
John McCallion: Yes. Good morning, Humphrey. So yes, we had a very strong Q3, I'd say, a number of items went in one direction that caused us to have a very strong result in Q3. As we think about quantification of that, you could put it in the area of, call it, $20 million, $25 million, give or take. And then as I said on - in my prepared remarks, we'd expect some elevated technology investments in the in the fourth quarter. So I'll give you some data point from this sure I give you anything outside of that, but that probably should help you kind of frame for your modeling.
Humphrey Lee: And then in terms of the overall expenses for company, is the 12.3% for the full year still the appropriate way to think about the expenses for 2021?
John McCallion: Yes. So I would say we continue to focus on the full year that's our target to be under 12 3%. Full year obviously we've been running well below that. I mentioned that we would expect to have elevated expenses in the fourth quarter. Quite honestly, it's not much different than the trend you saw a year ago, in terms of how things transpired for most of the year, and then we saw an uptick. And so that, if we're above 12.3% in the fourth quarter by a bit that would that would not be a surprise, per se, but that's not our focus. Just using that as an example when you talk about the 12.3% what's important to us is the 12.3% for the full year. And so, that's kind of our mindset when we think about our expense ratio, and we continue to anticipate to be under that on a full year basis.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of John Barnidge of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead
John Barnidge: An increase COVID impact on the group Life business is there a need to increase administrative expenses to deal with him during nature the pandemic at all?
Ramy Tadros: John, it's Rami here. The expense ratio on the Life business is pretty small. So the real the real issue is not operations or expenses, the real issue and the challenge you're seeing is just the claims front. So it's not really an expense issue at all this point.
John Barnidge: And then, would it be fair to say, if the seasonal increase in the direct expense ratio overall, obviously about 12.3% seems fair to come in well below 12% for the year, would there be a reevaluation of it longer term possibly? Thank you.
Ramy Tadros: John, it's Rami again here. I just want to maybe also further clarify our issue with the intent of your question with respect to what's going to change and what is changing on the life side is pricing. So we did talk about this, the last quarter we have and we continue to make rate adjustments in the group life business, in line with our perspective view of the pandemics. It's not operations related is related to the underwriting and the mortality. And as you look at the upcoming renewal season, we have been able to achieve rate adjustments and rate increases in line with our perspective view of mortality, while maintaining pretty strong persistency in our book. So and that's going to be an ongoing process that we're undertaking. So that's kind of what's changing, if you will, with respect to the group life piece.
John McCallion: And then I can take the second question you had John. This is John as well. Yes, our target is under 12.3% you said is it possible. Sure, anything is possible I guess, but ultimately, we are steadfast on being at or below 12.3%. Again, what we're trying to do is shift the mix of expenses that are within our expense base, and continue to drive savings and capacity for reinvestment. So we want to maintain being at or below 12.3% on a persistent basis every year. But at the same time, we want to continue to drive efficiencies that free up the allocation of resources to invest in the customer, invest in our processes, and to continue to drive growth for the firm. And so, at the same time, if we see headwinds in an economy, we can use that capacity as a protection for profit margin. So that's kind of our philosophy when it comes to our efficiency mindset. And I'd say nothing would kind of take us off that track at this point.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our CEO, Michel Khalaf for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.
Michel Khalaf: Great. Thank you, Operator. While the third quarter had outsized PE returns and COVID claims, we believe the underlying performance of our business, demonstrates the enduring strength and growth potential of the MetLife global insurance franchise. Although the pandemic continues to create uncertainty, I am confident in our ability to continue to execute and create long-term shareholder value for shareholders. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude your conference call for today. ON behalf of today's panel we like to thank you for your participation in today's earnings call and thank you for using our service. Have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-05 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2021 earnings call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address second quarter results. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features additional disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife's outstanding financial results in the second quarter provide further evidence of the tremendous progress we're making on the pillars of our Next Horizon strategy. We're continuing to focus with the right capital allocation and investment decisions. We're continuing to simplify with exceptional expense discipline. And we're continuing to differentiate with enhancements to our platform that are helping to drive record sales. When it comes to our strategy, we've transitioned from a period of execution risk to one of additional opportunity. Net income in the second quarter was $3.4 billion, up from $68 million a year ago. The primary drivers were growth in adjusted earnings, the gain we booked on the sale of our Auto & Home business and derivative gains in the current quarter relative to derivative losses a year ago. Strong net income drove book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA growth of 8%. Adjusted earnings in the second quarter were $2.1 billion or $2.37 per share, up 186% from $0.83 per share a year ago. As in the first quarter, our investment portfolio generated exceptionally strong variable investment income. Private equity remains the key driver of VII. As you know, private equity returns are reported on a one-quarter lag, so the strong Q2 performance reflected gains from Q1. We reported private equity gains of 9. 7% in the second quarter compared with a negative 8.2% a year ago. Equity markets continued to perform well from April through June, which we anticipate being reflected in our Q3 earnings. When we unveiled our Next Horizon strategy at Investor Day in December 2019, we pointed to the scale and expertise that we have in investments as a competitive advantage for MetLife. The strategic approach we have taken on private equity is a case in point. Our decision to sell most of our $2.5 billion hedge fund portfolio and increase the allocation to private equity has provided a better match for our long-dated liabilities while creating significant value for our shareholders. This was no accident, but the latest in a series of successful investment decisions from derisking our portfolio ahead of the financial crisis to selling Peter Cooper Village Stuyvesant Town near a market top. Turning to our reporting segments. John McCallion will provide a complete overview shortly. I would like to focus on how our results show that COVID-19 is both still with us but lessening in its impact. From an underwriting perspective, we've seen a sizable improvement, but we are still experiencing excess mortality. In the quarter, the Group Life mortality ratio was 94.3%, below the 106.3% from last quarter but still above the top end of our guidance range. In Latin America, we had $66 million of COVID losses, again, below the $150 million of COVID losses from Q1, but still above normal. Yet at the same time, COVID-19's economic group is easing somewhat. At MetLife, we see this emerging in sales trends. In the US group business, sales through the first half of 2021 are 39% higher than they were in the first half of 2020. And if current trends hold, 2021 will be a record sales year. In Latin America, sales are up 55% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, Asia sales are up 42%, while EMEA sales are up 20%. By their nature, claims are a backward-looking indicator and sales are a forward-looking indicator. So while we are not out of the woods, we are starting to see a clearing in the trees ahead. The path of the pandemic is something outside of our control. But as we have demonstrated over the past 1.5 years, we are not standing still. We are moving ahead with urgency to accelerate our strategy. To further differentiate our Group Benefits business, we acquired Versant Health and immediately became the third largest vision care provider in the United States. Versant has now been part of our results for two quarters. And in Q2, it contributed 6 points of year-over-year growth in US group premiums, fees and other revenues consistent with our expectations. Year-over-year, requests for vision care proposals are up more than 20% among our national account customers. We are pleased with how our new vision care offering is performing in the marketplace and expect it to contribute meaningfully to growth going forward. Similarly, we have enhanced our pet insurance offering to make it even more attractive to customers. We now offer telehealth -- care services, rollover benefits from the prior year and family plans covering multiple paths. And what we believe is the first for the industry, we also cover preexisting conditions when an employee switches to MetLife pet insurance from another carrier as long as the condition was covered by the prior plan. More than 500 employers now offer MetLife pet insurance as a voluntary benefit to their employees, and we believe our best-in-class product will continue to make gains in this highly attractive and underpenetrated market. To strengthen our focus, we made a decision to sell our businesses in Poland and Greece to an end group. This was another promise we made at Investor Day, to continue to look at our portfolio through the lens of strategic fit and ability to achieve scale and clear our hurdle rate. Since that time, we have sold or reached agreement to sell our businesses in four markets, and we will continue to apply this disciplined approach. In early April, we also closed on the sale of our Auto & Home business to Farmers Insurance for $3.94 billion in cash. The 10-year strategic partnership we forged allows each company to focus on its core strength. Farmers 90 years of P&C underwriting and service excellence and MetLife's unrivaled distribution reach in the US group benefits space. The simplified pillar of our strategy was evident in our exceptional expense management. In the quarter, we delivered a direct expense ratio of 11.4% and we now expect to beat our 12.3% target ratio, not only for all of 2021, but for 2022 as well. We are making this commitment despite selling our Auto & Home business, which operated at a lower expense ratio than the overall enterprise. As we have said many times, we are embedding an efficiency mindset across everything we do. It is central to our ability to deliver continuous improvement. At MetLife, we no longer have expense reduction programs. We do not need them. What we have instead is a publicly disclosed direct expense ratio target that we have brought down by 200 basis points over the past five years and promise to keep there. This is how we hold ourselves accountable, and this is how investors can hold us accountable as well. Our strategic decision to sell Auto & Home contributed to a $6.5 billion cash buffer as of June 30, well above our target range. We repurchased $1.1 billion of common shares in the second quarter and another $248 million of common shares so far in the third. And yesterday, our Board approved a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization. This is on top of the $475 million we have remaining on our December 2020 authorization. We believe that investing in responsible growth, steadily increasing our common dividend and buying back common stock are all vital parts of a balanced approach to creating long-term shareholder value. COVID-19 continues to present MetLife with the opportunity and the obligation to step-up for our employees, our customers and our communities. That work is ongoing. We are in a new phase of the pandemic. The primary focus now is on vaccinating as many people as possible. Nothing will do more to prevent needless death and a potential resurgence of the lockdown measures that caused so much economic harm. As we did over 100 years ago with our visiting nurses program, MetLife has mobilized to make a positive contribution to advance public health. First and foremost, this means doing all we can to give our own employees and their families access to the vaccines. Examples from our markets include giving employees paid leave to get vaccinated, covering vaccine-related expenses such as travel and childcare and holding free vaccine clinics for employees and their families in locations as varied as Ruskin, New York and Osaka, Japan, but it also means helping to vaccinate the broader population as well. In Nagasaki, Japan, we've opened 6,500 square feet of our headquarters as a free vaccination site. MetLife Foundation has committed $500,000 to delivering vaccines to underserved communities across the U.S., and our medically trained staff, are volunteering to administer doses at vaccine sites. In closing, to perform as well as we have through a pandemic, highlights some fundamental truth about MetLife. We have an all-weather strategy that holds up well to stress. We have an investment portfolio that captures meaningful upside. We have competitive advantages that enable us to grow in the most attractive markets, and we have a relentless focus on execution. At our 2019 Investor Day, we said our Next Horizon strategy would generate tangible benefits for shareholders, a 12% to 14% adjusted ROE, $20 billion of distributable cash over five years and an additional $1 billion of operating leverage to self-fund growth. We are on track to meet every one of those commitments. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to John.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q 2021 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Please note in the appendix, we have also provided an, updated 25 basis point sensitivity for our U.S. long-term interest rate assumption. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income in the quarter was $3.4 billion, or approximately $1.3 billion higher than adjusted earnings. This variance was primarily due to net investment gains of $1.3 billion, of which $1.1 billion relates to the sale of our Property and Casualty business to Farmers Insurance. Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continued to perform as expected. Additionally, adjusted earnings include one notable item of $66 million related to a legal reserve release. On page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. As I previously noted, there was one notable item of $66 million in 2Q of 2021 and no notable items for the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding the notable item was $2.30, benefiting from strong returns in our private equity portfolio, which drove most of the year-over-year variance. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were flat year-over-year as volume growth and the Versant Health acquisition largely offset unfavorable underwriting margins. Group Life mortality improved sequentially but remains elevated in the quarter. I will discuss in more detail, shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 73.8% in 2Q of 2021, within its annual target range of 70% to 75% but higher than the prior year quarter of 58.5%, which benefited from extremely low dental utilization and favorable disability incidents. We've seen a return to more normal utilization rates for non-medical health and expect this trend to continue. Therefore, we expect the interest-adjusted benefit ratio to remain within its annual target range for the remainder of the year. Overall, business fundamentals for group benefits remain healthy, highlighted by strong top line growth and persistency. Group Benefit sales were up 39% year-to-date, primarily due to higher general case activity. And remain on track to deliver a record sales year in 2021. Adjusted PFOs were $5.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Several factors contributed to the strong year-over-year growth, including a $500 million impact relating to dental premium credits and the establishment of a dental unearned premium reserve both reducing premiums in the second quarter of 2020, which collectively contributed 13 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate. In addition, four percentage points were related to higher premiums in the current quarter from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. After considering these factors, underlying PFO growth for Group Benefits was roughly 12% and driven by solid volume growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary and the addition of Versant Health. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, while Group Benefits reported PFO growth rates will be impacted by the dental unearned premium reserve release in Q3 and Q4, we expect the underlying PFO growth to maintain its strength and resilience for the remainder of 2021. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $654 million, up $462 million year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income largely due to strong private equity returns. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins compared to 2Q of 2020. RIS investment spreads were 224 basis points, up 199 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 98 basis points, up 13 basis points year-over-year due in part to sustained pay downs in our portfolios of residential mortgage loans and residential mortgage-backed securities, a partial recovery in real estate equities, and lower LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures, including UK longevity reinsurance, grew 8% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. With regards to pension risk transfers, we continue to see a robust PRT pipeline. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 103% and 91% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Asia's solid volume growth also contributed to the strong performance driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% and 6% on a constant currency basis. Additionally, while against a weak 2Q of 2020, Asia sales were up 42% year-over-year on a constant currency basis demonstrating the resiliency in the business. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 27% and 38% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting and unfavorable equity markets related to the Chilean encaje, which had a negative 1.5% return in the quarter versus a positive 14% in 2Q of 2020. This was partially offset by favorable investment margins. COVID-19-related claims improved sequentially. The impact on Latin America's second quarter adjusted earnings was approximately $66 million after tax. While Latin America's bottom line has been dampened by the elevated COVID-19-related claims, the underlying fundamentals of the business remain robust as evidenced by strong sales and persistency throughout the region. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 55% driven by solid growth in all markets. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 19% and 23% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by higher COVID-19-related claims in the current period compared to low utilization in the prior year period. Solid volume growth was a partial offset. The current quarter has also benefited from a favorable refinement to an unearned premium reserve positively impacting adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings by approximately $15 million after tax. In addition, Poland and Greece contribute roughly 10% to run rate earnings that will be reported in divested businesses beginning in the third quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 8% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 20% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher credit life sales in Turkey and solid growth in UK Employee Benefits. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up $516 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. In addition, Life underwriting margins were favorable. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 47.1%, lower than the prior year quarter of 59.1% and below our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding the favorable notable item of $66 million related to a legal reserve release was $126 million. This result compared favorably to the adjusted loss of $289 million in 2Q of 2020 due to higher net investment income, lower expenses and lower preferred stock dividends. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 21.6% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. The Group Life mortality ratio was 94.3% in the second quarter of 2021, which is above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims in 2Q of 2021 were roughly 4.5 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $75 million after tax. Additionally, the quarter included a higher level of life claims above $2.5 million and an additional level of excess mortality that appears to be COVID related. These collectively impacted the ratio by an additional 2.7 percentage points or $40 million after-tax. There were approximately 50,000 COVID-19-related deaths in the US in the second quarter of 2021. While still elevated, total deaths have moderated versus the prior year and sequential quarters. Looking ahead, we expect COVID-19-related deaths and group benefits to continue to trend lower. Now let's turn to Page 6. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income over the last five quarters, including approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2021. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 9.7% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one-quarter lag. Our second quarter results are essentially in line with PE industry benchmarks. While all private equity asset classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 22% of our PE account balance of $11.3 billion, were the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 19% quarterly return. On Page 7, second quarter VII of $950 million post tax is shown by segment. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As we have previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia, generally account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly one-third each, although it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. VII results in 2Q of '21 were more heavily weighted towards RIS and MetLife Holdings, as Asia's private equity portfolio is less mature and has a smaller proportion of the venture capital funds that I referenced earlier. Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters and full year 2020, including 11.4% in the second quarter of '21. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. In 2Q of '21, our favorable direct expense ratio benefited from solid topline growth and ongoing expense discipline, as well as lower employee-related benefits in the quarter. We expect the direct expense ratio for the remainder of 2021 to be elevated compared to the first half of 2021, due to timing of investments and seasonality. But as Michel noted, we expect full year '21 and '22 direct expense ratio to beat our 12.3% guidance. Now, I'll discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.5 billion at June 30, which is up from $3.8 billion at March 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the proceeds received from our P&C sale to Farmers Insurance of $3.9 billion. In addition, HoldCo cash includes the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, a $500 million redemption of preferred stock, share repurchases of $1.1 share repurchases of $1.1 billion, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our US companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.8 billion, while net income was approximately $1.6 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.2 billion year-over-year, driven by lower variable annuity rider reserves and an increase in investment margin. Year-to-date 2021 net income decreased by $286 million, as compared to the first half of 2020. The primary drivers were derivative losses, mostly offset by increases in operating earnings and net investment gains in the current six-month period, compared to large derivative gains in the prior year six-month period. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.5 billion as of June 30, 2021, up 9% compared to December 31, 2020, when excluding our P&C business sold to farmers. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 873% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. The sequential decline in the Japan SMR from 967% at December 31st reflects seasonal dividends and the rise in US interest rates in the quarter ending March 31st. In summary, MetLife delivered another strong quarter driven by exceptional private equity returns, good business fundamentals, ongoing expense discipline, and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. While higher mortality due to COVID-19 has masked the earnings power of Group Benefits in Latin America, the strength of these franchises remain healthy and intact. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and position us for success. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Hi, thank you. I was hoping you could provide some more details on your expense ratio outlook and the drivers of the improved guidance there? And how are you thinking about expenses in the second half of 2021 and the longer term target level for the expense ratio?
John McCallion: Good morning Eric. So, I'll just start out by saying we're very pleased with the result and the execution by everyone in the firm. And I think as Michel said in his opening remarks, this has really become part of our culture and it's a cultural shift that we've made, our efficiency mindset is built into our strategy. It's built into our everyday activities, and I think the results are -- kind of speak for themselves. As I mentioned, in this quarter, there's a few timing-related items. So, we do see an uptick in expenses in the second half of the year relative to the first half. We did have some benefit from some employee-related costs, particularly as they relate to the impact of how markets move. And so that came -- that was a benefit this quarter. And then there's seasonality with regards to preferred stock dividends. So, the second and the fourth quarter typically are low quarters for those dividends. As we look to the second half of this year, directionally speaking, we would see -- just typically do see seasonally higher expenses in the second half. Some of that's related, obviously, to our group business and the enrollment activities we go through. And oftentimes, too, there's been some delays just as a result of a number of activities going on in some of the investments. So, we do see kind of an uptick. Having said that, one of the things that we both pointed out is our expectation, which is different than where we were on our outlook call in February, is to now be under our 12.3% guidance despite the removal of our Property & Casualty business, which had a lower expense ratio. So, all-in-all, I think our efficiency mindset just built into the culture, it's all working. And we expect that to continue as we look forward. I think I would probably stop there on your last question and probably leave that for another day.
Erik Bass: Got it. Appreciate that. And then secondly, can you expand a bit on the Group Life mortality results given vaccination trends? Are you seeing more of the COVID impact shifting to group? I think as you mentioned, the benefits ratio, even taking out the $75 million was still at the high end of the target range. So, do you think these other excess claims relate directly to the pandemic, but just more recorded as COVID deaths? Or are you seeing any increase in non-COVID mortality?
Ramy Tadros: Very good morning Erik, it's Ramy here. So let me just start by giving you a bit more color on the results. And I'll essentially just give you a bit of a walk from the headline number of 94.3% in terms of the major drivers of that. So the first is COVID-related – COVID deaths in the quarter. That's the $50,000 population -- 50,000 population death number impacting our portfolio. And that's worth about 4.5 points, as John pointed out. There's another piece in the quarter, which is that from time to time, we do experience higher volume of claims with larger face amounts, which does impact our mortality ratio. This is non-COVID related, and that was about – worth about a 0.1 to our loss ratio in this quarter. And then the third piece of this is when we look at our claims data, we did see an increase in certain death codes, which are highly correlated to COVID. So, while the cause of death for those claims is not explicitly stated as COVID, the excess mortality does appear to be COVID related, and that was worth another 1.7% on our ratio. So, if I think about the quarter and looking forward, there are probably 2 headlines I'd leave you with. One is that, if you strip out those 3 factors, our loss ratio is very close to the midpoint of our range. And the second headline is that, we have seen significant declines in deaths in Q2 versus Q1. We've also seen sequential declines in deaths month-on-month continuing into July. So, despite the current uncertainty with the Delta variant, we're also encouraged by the increase in the pace of vaccination. We're encouraged by the actions undertaken by many large employers, which are impacting the vaccination rates for that insured population. So, sitting here in August on a go-forward basis, we do think that the impact of the pandemic will gradually subside and you should expect from a run rate perspective, our loss ratio to return back to pre-pandemic levels.
Erik Bass: Great. Thank you. Appreciate the color.
Operator: And our next question is from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. 
Tom Gallagher: Thanks. John, just a question on the comment you made on base spreads in RIS, which came back nicely this quarter. You highlighted the mortgage prepays. How should we think about that from a timing standpoint? Because tell me, if I'm thinking about this right. It definitely creates near-term gains. And I presume with rates remaining low, that's going to remain strong. So probably the base spread in that business will remain strong, assuming mortgage prepaid remain high. But then there's sort of the back-end question, which is as we kind of go -- as this levels off and diminishes then there's the reinvestment pressure that kind of emerges. So would you ultimately expect this to be a negative for base spreads? And if so, when would we likely see that?
Michel Khalaf: Good morning, Tom. So, as you said, we have had a uptick there in the spreads ex-VII. And as I mentioned in my remarks, a plus 13% year-over-year and then you see a plus 10 sequentially. So, it's a number of factors, right? We got lower LIBOR year-over-year. You have a partial recovery in real estate equity returns we saw -- we've had very good, strong new business spreads as particularly -- or I should say, in RIS there. And then as you said, the last thing is we've seen elevated levels of the residential mortgage paydown activity. I would use the word paydown just to not confuse that with prepayment fees that we categorize in VII. And so what that really is, is that that acceleration of the recognition of income on those securities that were purchased at a discount previously. So we do think this will stay elevated. I think it's a combination of low rates coupled with the home price appreciation that we've seen in a lot of markets. So that has spurred others. And I think also, if you think of it in combination with more remote work opportunities, there's been probably some movement in terms of the residential housing market. So we do see that continuing particularly although they've probably peaked, the time between when action occurs and when it hits our securities or mortgage loans is usually a two to five month lag. So we think the second half of the year, we'll still see an elevated level, maybe not to this level that we saw in the second quarter. We expect it to probably be somewhat less than that. But -- so that's kind of our expectation. As you look forward, look, this is all just part of our broader portfolio. And I wouldn't say this in and of itself is going to change the trajectory. I think what it's done is it's changed the trajectory upwards. We don't consider that to be a long-term trend, probably remains a trend for the remainder of this year but probably goes back to more baseline run rate in 2022.
Tom Gallagher: That makes sense. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. Non-Japan Asia sales declined a lot sequentially. Any color on what regions drove that and what happened there?
Michel Khalaf: Yeah, Tom. So certainly, we have to think about sequential in the context of overall sales environment in which we're in. So if I take a step back, if you don't mind me and think about this in the overall Asia context, Overall, Asia, we did well this quarter, 42% up year-over-year, 71% in Japan, 11% in Asia ex-Japan, still positive in Asia ex-Japan as well. And this is despite COVID spurts in many of our markets. And if you take the first half, all in total, we have a 25% year-over-year collectively for the first half. And so there are a number of reasons which certainly drove that strong performance. On a sequential basis -- and if you look at Japan, and I'll come to other Asia very quickly. And if you look at the sequentially both on the life side and as well as the A&H sales, we were up, right? And that speaks to the resilience of our face-to-face channels in our markets in Japan, in particular. And the pressure on a sequential basis came in from the annuities because the banker channel is certainly -- they have a March end. And so therefore, they're much stronger on the banker side and that's what the annuity shows drop sequentially. On other Asia, if you think about it, this is -- COVID is playing out significantly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. There's a fair amount of pressure in all these markets. And we're very much a face-to-face sales business, and that certainly is weighing in despite, by the way, all our efforts in terms of strong execution, our success of our new products and certainly, our digitization efforts are paying off as well. Now as I said, this COVID uncertainty is continuing on. And a vast majority of our market significantly lagged the US, say, for example, in terms of vaccination rate. And right now, because of the resurgence of COVID in some of our markets, social distancing measures are being reintroduced, right? So while we did well year-over-year in other Asia, sequentially, we've been impacted. And both in Japan and other Asia, we expect to see Q3 sales to be sequentially flat to Q2 as well. But considering everything at this point, if you think about our guidance for the full year, we expect to be on track to meet the double-digit guidance that we provided in February. I hope that helps.
Tom Gallagher: That does. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we go to the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. First, I just had a question on MetLife Holdings. If you look at earnings in the business, they've been pretty high the last couple of quarters. And I think this quarter you had alternative investment income that helped and also lower life mortality. But I'm wondering to what extent long-term care was a tailwind and just what you're seeing in terms of claim submission in the LTC business. Has that gotten back to normal as the – versus what it was last year?
John McCallion: Good morning, Jimmy, it's John. Yes. So I'll just break it up. In the Life side, as you saw in our interest-adjusted benefit ratio, we had a strong result really for this block of business, minimal, actually de minimis COVID impact this quarter. So it actually, I would say, declined faster. The impact declined faster than we had probably expected. But I think a number of factors that you can probably come to probably makes that – makes sense, whether it's the average age, and the percent of vaccinations at the older age, things like that. On the LTC side metrics, there was – it was really – there was no material positive from LTC. It was in line with expectations. What we're seeing is that – and I'd say, in line with, I'll say, pre-pandemic expectations. And so what we're seeing is metrics and results really trending back towards those pre-COVID levels. New claims are, I'd say, marginally below trend, but all indications are showing that we'll be back to trend very soon. The only metric that's lagging – but again, I will say, trending back to pre-pandemic is the relationship of home care versus nursing home claims. So it's still probably a little elevated in the home care side, but that's – it's trending down. It's trending back to the pre-pandemic ratios.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on Group Life, how are you thinking – it doesn't seem like anybody sort of assumed COVID in their pricing this year and obviously, not all of the business prices – re-prices each year. But how are you thinking about renewals in the Group Life side? If we still -- if the pandemic is still ongoing, do you think you'll try to get higher prices in part of the book? Or would you just have to -- would the market not bear that given that most companies are not really making many adjustments? And should we assume margins will remain weak until the pandemic is done?
Michel Khalaf: Hi, Jimmy. Look, when we price our business, be it new business and/or renewals, we take a whole number of factors into account. Many of them are case specific factors. But clearly, the outlook, both near-term and medium-term for mortality is a component of that. So as the pandemic unfolded, we certainly did take into account with respect to near-term mortality in our pricing. And again, it does vary by case, and it depends on the length of the guarantee period and the size of the case and a number of other factors. But certainly, that has been taken into account as we look to renew business or price for new business. The other point I would just point you to here as you think about our business in particular and our SKU towards the larger end of the market, is we have a very consistent track record over many, many years of taking appropriate renewal actions, while maintaining very high persistency on that book to -- from the mid to the high 90s. So that's another factor that I would point you to as well.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hi, good morning. Could you provide some additional detail on non-medical health trends you saw in the quarter, I guess, particularly on dental utilization and severity and how you'd expect that to trend towards -- throughout the rest of the year?
Ramy Tadros: Hi, Ryan, it's Ramy here again. I think the -- overhead line that I'll leave you with for both dental and disability is that we are seeing our results normalize back to pre-pandemic levels. And so specifically to your question on dental, if you look at the entirety of the first half, the overall results certainly reflects that return to pre-pandemic utilization levels, albeit there was some, if you will, Q1 versus Q2 dynamics with respect to the utilization of certain services that others have spoken about, and we've seen that to be pretty consistent with our book. But in aggregate, the first half is trending towards the pre-pandemic utilization level. And we're certainly seeing that normalization continue into July as we look at it. So in aggregate, if you want to take a really big step back and look at our non-medical health ratio, we expect that for the full year to be close to the midpoint of our guidance. And that's inclusive clearly of the various products that we have in there.
Ryan Krueger: Thanks. And then for LATAM COVID impact, can you give us a sense of how those trended throughout the quarter? And did they continue to decline -- did they decline throughout the quarter and into July?
Eric Clurfain: Yes. Ryan, this is Eric. So with regards to COVID, we noticed a significant sequential improvement this quarter with month-to-month positive trend. But as you know, the delta variant and the slow pace of vaccination, obviously, creates some uncertainty moving forward. Nevertheless, overall, we expect the second half of the year to be better than the first half. Now as John referenced, this quarter has also highlighted again the strength of our business fundamentals and our franchise across the region. And we expect overall revenues to continue to grow, supported by a strong persistency and recovery in sales. We've had good momentum in sales we created since the beginning of this year. We reported $222 million for the quarter, back in line with the levels of pre-pandemic. And this really demonstrates the strength, diversity and resiliency of our distribution channel and product mix. Our persistency, as I mentioned earlier, has been also very resilient and above expectations, and that's true across the region. So, in summary, from an outlook perspective, for the year remains unchanged, and we expect 2022 earnings to return to the normal run rate levels once the pandemic recedes.
Ryan Krueger: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Mike Ward with UBS. Please go ahead.
Mike Ward: Thanks. Good morning. So I think the buybacks in the quarter and the new authorization are pretty well received. I'm just curious, should we go forward with the assumption, absent any other opportunities for deployment? Should we expect to continue at this $1 billion or $1 billion-plus buyback rate quarterly?
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Hi, Mike. Thank you for the question. So let me start by saying that we continue to be comfortable with the $3 billion to $4 billion buffer and over time, we expect to return to these levels. We're very deliberate and disciplined in how we deploy capital. One of our highest priorities on how we use capital is to fund responsible growth. And we continue to deploy capital in support of organic growth and attractive IRRs and payback periods. We're also opportunistic when it comes to M&A. Any M&A transaction must be supported strategically. We look forward add to the top line, clearly a number of important financial metrics, including accretion. So -- but if we're not able to deploy excess capital to fund business growth, then we have a commitment to return it to shareholders. And I think that our recent buyback activity should give you a sense of our pacing and the fact that our Board has just issued a new authorization, should also provide you a sense of its sustainability. So I hope this helps.
Mike Ward: It does. Thanks. And then, I was just wondering if you might be able to comment on the bid-ask spread in terms of any further derisking, perhaps, in areas like Holdings or RIS. And I don't want to downplay the efforts and success you've had so far, but it just seems like M&A in this industry continues to pick up, specifically in some capital intensive areas. And it feels like that's going to continue. Just trying to gauge your willingness or ability to further derisk anywhere. And given your excess capital position, is it sort of within the realm of possibility that you could utilize any of that within anything for further derisking?
John McCallion: Hey. Good morning, Mike, it's John. So, look, I think the trend that you're referencing, our belief is the trend is going to continue. It's not going anywhere. I don't think that changes what -- how we're addressing and focusing on MetLife Holdings. It, as you said, has performed very well. Our focus is on optimization, whether a diversified block with a number of natural offsets, the team has done a great job managing it. But at the same time, as I said, the team's mandate is to kind of take a third-party view, an external view and make sure that we're continuing to look at different ways to be prepared for the opportunity in what I'd say is a new market within the industry, which is this kind of block acquisition or transfer or risk transfer. So nothing's changed on our end. In terms of bid ask, I don't know if I've seen any, I'll say, clear signs that it's changed at this point. But this is a dynamic, I'd say, area right now, and our focus is to be ready, if it does change. So
Mike Ward: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please go ahead. 
Tracy Benguigui: Thank you. Good morning. Some of my questions were already asked, so I only have one. When looking at your group benefit since you operate in a larger segment, I'm wondering if you could contextualize the life cycle of sales. Would it take longer as we anticipate a rebound when the economy reopens?
Michel Khalaf: Yes. I think there are a few things I'd point you to. We have seen -- from a life cycle perspective, we've seen less of an impact on the large employers during the pandemic. You see we're on track for a record year in terms of sales in 2021. And a lot of that activity happened in 2020, if you think about this in terms of when these cases came to market and our dialogue with the employers. So from that perspective, we have not seen a real disruption, and we're very, very pleased with our sales results the year. And as John and Michel referenced, we're on track for a record year in group sales and our national account segment is an important driver of that. And so is our momentum in voluntary, where we're less reliant on face-to-face distribution given the digital capabilities that we have and that has continued to drive our sales momentum there. The last thing I would just say is if you just really take a big step back, think about the impact that COVID had on the environment. We've seen a significant increase in awareness on the part of employees for needs of protection for obvious reasons. But we've also seen employers be really, really focused on benefits as a key lever in terms of engaging with their talent. So we're seeing very high receptivity and more strategic dialogue, I would say, with some of the large employers on how to utilize those benefits to attract, retain and motivate talent.
Tracy Benguigui: Yes, I fully recognize that. I was just thinking about further upside. And I've heard you speak at another event, where you were saying basically that folks working from home care a little bit more about some of these voluntary offerings as they're thinking about their families. So fully recognized where you were in the pandemic and just thinking about the possibility of future sales and when that would flow through.
Michel Khalaf: Yes. I mean those were -- the fundamental trends is the employers kind of perspective on the benefit, as you just described. And they're more keen to engage with their employees -- the employees' awareness of the need for protection. So, those two trends, I think, have clearly kind of emerged in the pandemic and they're going to drive momentum going forward. With respect to the sales numbers, I would also just remind you that the sales in the jumbo market can be lumpy from year to year. So, you saw a dip in 2020. You saw a spike in 2021. So, some of those can be lumpy year-over-year from a jumbo perspective. But the secular trends on employer and employee I think we're seeing and we're seeing providing overall tailwinds for our business here.
Tracy Benguigui: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. Just in terms of EMEA, can you give us a sense, are there other countries that may not be kind of at scale kind of like, I think, Greece and Poland? And can you give us some color in terms of like the M&A environment in EMEA as it relates to interest from third parties and just consolidating the European insurance market?
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Hi Suneet, this is Michel. So, we're -- first of all, I would say we're happy with our EMEA business. As I sort of referenced before, it's predominantly a protection business with high free cash flow generation. So, it plays a role in terms of -- and how it contributes to the enterprise. Since the -- acquisition, we've reduced our footprint globally in terms of the markets that we're in. We were in 66 markets, we're now in 40. And so this sort of -- the process that we are committed to, which is to continue to look at our businesses through the lens of strategic fit in terms of whether they clear our risk-adjusted hurdle rate. Whether we see a path to them achieving that and achieving scale, I think that applies sort of across the board, and I expect us to continue to look at our portfolio through that lens. But nothing in particular that I would point to in terms of EMEA. I think if you think about Poland and Greece, those were two businesses that sat outside of our European super carrier. As you know, we have an efficient operating model in EMEA, especially in Europe, where we -- all of our businesses are branches of our Irish entity. Poland and Greece were both subsidiaries that sat outside of that. So, in a way, this transaction helps us simplify the region and the business operationally. But I think in terms of the market environment, I mean we continue to see sort of -- we were not the first company to divest from Poland. There was -- Aviva was -- had a transaction prior to that. So, there continues to be interest by mainly European players in terms of opportunities in those markets. That's what I would sort of point to there.
Suneet Kamath: Okay, got it. And then just last one for John, on free cash flow. It seems based on the commentary in the buyback press release that maybe free cash flow in 2020 was below your 65% to 75% target. So, just wanted to see, if that was a fair characterization. And then are we still thinking about 65% to 75% as kind of the range that you guys would like to be in kind of going forward?
John McCallion: Yes. I mean the quick answer is no. It was -- I don't think -- that wasn't our intention, if that was the takeaway, but it was definitely within the 65% to 75%, if not higher. And yes, I think the go-forward is the range is intact.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. We will now turn the conference, back over to Chairman, Michel Khalaf for final comments. Please go ahead.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, operator. As many of you prepared to spend time with family and loved ones this summer, I want to wish everyone well.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife’s first quarter 2021 earnings call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer is on the call this morning, along with other members of senior management, who will be available to participate in the discussion. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter. They are available on our website. John McCallion is under the weather today. We are going to let him rest his voice, and I will speak to the supplemental slides following Michel's remarks. An appendix to the supplemental slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, all of which you should also review. After our prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As we reported last evening, MetLife delivered very strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021. Our diverse business mix, sound investment strategy and strong expense discipline combined to generate earnings well above consensus expectations. By the numbers, we reported first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of $2 billion or $2.20 per share, up 39% from $1.58 a year ago. The primary driver was exceptionally strong variable investment income, or VII, partially offset by elevated COVID-19 related claims. Net income for the quarter was $290 million, down from $4.4 billion a year ago, primarily due to losses on derivatives that protect our balance sheet from declines in equity markets and interest rates. Such gains and losses are the result of GAAP accounting rules that require us to mark certain of our derivative hedges to market through net income without similar treatment for the assets and liabilities being hedged. We believe the economics and the free cash flow of our business are captured in adjusted earnings. Regarding variable investment income, the key driver of gains in the first quarter was our private equity portfolio, which delivered returns of 13.3%. Recall that private equity returns are reported on a one quarter lag. The strong performance in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by three private equity sectors: domestic leveraged buyout funds, European LBOs and venture capital. In the second half of 2020, IPOs from U.S.-based LBOs and venture capital firms more than doubled over the prior year, and the market rewarded many entrants with strong valuation. Venture capital our best performer across the three sub sectors, largely due to the markets appetite for tech companies received will volumes had a record in 2020 and the increase in digital activity, spurred by the pandemic drove attractive valuations for early stage tech firms positioned to capitalize on that trend. While our private equity portfolio return and the quarter was robust. It was in line with industry benchmarks, most notably Cambridge Associates Private Equity Index. We are confident this asset class will continue to be a significant source of alpha format life in the future. Turning to the performance of our business segments, I’ll begin with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings were down 70% year-over-year on elevated COVID-19 life claims. In the U.S., overall, COVID-19 related deaths are 40% higher in the first quarter of 2021 than they were in the fourth quarter of 2020. For MetLife, our group life mortality ratio was 106.3%, well above the high end of our target range of 85% to 90%, with approximately 17 percentage points attributable to COVID-19 claims. The top line performance of the Group Benefits business was strong, with sales up 45% year-over-year. We are doing especially well with national accounts. And if trends hold, we expect the group business to deliver a record sales year. Adjusted PFO growth was also solid at 16% with the addition of Versant Health being a large contributor. In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 92% year-over-year, driven by higher VII. Beyond VII, adjusted earnings were still strong on favorable underwriting and volume growth. Looking ahead, we continue to see a robust pension risk transfer pipeline. Rising equity markets and interest rates have improved pension plan funding levels and lowered the cost for plan sponsors to transact with an insurer. Within Asia, we saw a similar earnings pattern to RIS. Adjusted earnings were up 70% year-over-year on a constant currency basis driven by higher VII. However, even allowing for VII, adjusted earnings were strong driven by favorable foreign exchange rates, volume growth and underwriting. Sales in the region were up 12% on a constant currency basis, even with the COVID resurgence in certain markets. In Latin America, adjusted earnings were down 57% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the pandemic. COVID related claims in the quarter totaled approximately $150 million, mainly in Mexico. In EMEA, adjusted earnings of $71 million were down 11% on a constant currency basis on higher coverage related claims as well as higher expenses compared to the favorable prior year quarter. Sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis, with strong momentum in the U.K. employee benefits space. To finish my business segment discussion, I think a theme is clear. If you look past higher VII and mortality in the quarter, the underlying performance of the business was very solid. On the fundamentals, we continue to demonstrate consistent execution with strong earnings power across a range of different economic scenarios. Turning to cash and capital management. MetLife ended the first quarter with cash at the holding company of $3.8 billion, near the top end of our $3 billion to $4 billion target buffer. Our two-year average free cash flow ratio remains within our guidance range of 65% to 75%. Currently, our cash balances are much higher following the receipt of $3.94 billion of proceeds on the sale of our U.S. P&C business. During the quarter, we were pleased to return $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders, $1 billion in share repurchases and approximately $400 million in common stock dividends. So far in Q2, we have bought back an additional $210 million of common shares, and we have roughly $1.6 billion remaining under our current repurchase authorization. Last week, our Board of Directors approved a second quarter 2021 common stock dividend of $0.48 per share, up 4.3% from the first quarter. Over the last decade, we have increased our common dividend at a 10% compound annual growth rate. Our consistent execution continues to generate strong free cash flow that allows us to invest in growth and return capital to our shareholders, all with the goal of driving long-term value creation. As we look ahead, we see a path to a brighter future from both an economic and health perspective. In the United States, conditions look promising for a period of employment growth, which is always good for our group business. On the pandemic front, we believe the worst of the underwriting effects on our company are behind us as the vaccine rollout continues to advance. The progress is not yet uniform across the world, and certain areas are still struggling, but the trend line is clear, a slow but steady return to something we can call normalcy. While we welcome an improving external environment, we also remain laser-focused on executing our strategy to ensure we are prepared for the post pandemic world. For our customers, we continue to accelerate our digital transformation to meet their evolving needs. In Japan, for example, 95% of our policy submissions are now done digitally. For our employees, we will be implementing a more flexible workplace model in Q3, which for most will be a hybrid approach. While our people have performed exceptionally well, working from home during the pandemic, we believe the office will continue to play a critical role in fostering collaboration, innovation and career development. We are equally confident that by incorporating more virtual work into our model, we will enhance productivity gain access to a broader talent pool and strengthen employee engagement. To close this morning, I want to emphasize the urgency we are filling up MetLife to keep raising our game. As I said in my annual letter to shareholders, consistent execution is our new baseline. Continuous improvement is our new aspiration and expectation. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to John.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel. I will start with the 1Q 2021 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3. We provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income in the quarter was $290 million or approximately $1.7 billion lower than adjusted earnings. This variance was primarily due to net derivative losses as a result of the significant rise in long-term interest rates as well as stronger equity markets in 1Q 2021. Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continue to perform as expected. On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment. There were no notable items for either period. Adjusted earnings per share benefited from exceptionally strong returns in our private equity portfolio and were up 39% and 38% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits, adjusted earnings were down 70% year-over-year, largely driven by unfavorable group life mortality due to elevated COVID-19 related life claims. Favorable non-medical health underwriting and volume growth were partial offsets. Overall, results for Group Benefits were mixed. Adjusted earnings were down, but underlying fundamentals, including top line growth and persistency were strong. Group Benefits sales were up 45% year-over-year, primarily due to higher jumbo case activity. We believe that we are on track to deliver a record sales year in 2021. Adjusted PFOs were $5.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year due to solid volume growth across most products, the addition of Versant Health and roughly 5 percentage points related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claims experience. I will discuss Group Benefits underwriting in more detail shortly. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 92% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, largely due to strong private equity returns. In addition, elevated COVID-19 mortality and volume growth were positive contributors. RIS investment spreads were 234 basis points up 120 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 88 basis points, up 5 basis points year-over-year primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures, including U.K. longevity reinsurance, grew 12% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. With regard to U.K. longevity reinsurance, we have continued to see strong growth since completing our initial transaction in 2Q 2020. The notional balance stands at $8.8 billion at March 31, up nearly $5 billion from year-end 2020. And as previously announced, first quarter results for Property & Casualty are reflected as a divested business in our quarterly financial statements. The sale of the auto and home business to farmers insurance closed on April 7, and we expect to record an after-tax gain of approximately $1 billion in 2Q 2021 Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 78% and 70% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. Asia's solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 6% and 4% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, with growth across most markets. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 58% and 57% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting, partially offset by the improvement in equity markets. Elevated COVID-19 related claims, primarily in Mexico, impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $150 million after-tax. Looking ahead, we expect COVID-19 claims to decrease throughout the year, more significantly in the second half, and adjusted earnings to return to 2019 levels in 2022, which is consistent with our outlook. Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis due to lower single premium immediate annuities sales in Chile. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 9% and 11% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by higher COVID-19 related claims as well as higher expenses compared to the favorable prior year quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 5% on a constant currency basis, but sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis, due to strong growth in U.K. employee benefits. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 123%. This increase was primarily driven by higher variable investment income, largely due to private equity returns. Also, favorable equity markets and long-term care underwriting were positive drivers. Long-term care benefited from higher policy and claim terminations as well as lower claim incidences. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 54.8%, higher than the prior year quarter of 51% and at the top end of our annual target range of 50% to 55% due to elevated COVID-19 mortality. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $171 million. This result is consistent with our 2021 adjusted loss guidance range of $650 million to $750 million. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20.8% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now I will provide more detail on Group Benefits 1Q 2021 underwriting performance on Page 5. There were approximately 200,000 COVID-19 related deaths in the U.S. in the first quarter, the highest single quarter since the pandemic began and up nearly 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition to the higher number of claims, there were more deaths at younger ages below 65, which resulted in increased claim severity. Apart from COVID-19, the number of life insurance claims of greater than $2 million nearly doubled versus a typical quarter. The group life mortality ratio was 106.3% in the first quarter, which included roughly 17 percentage points related to COVID-19 life claims. This reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $280 million after-tax. For group non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 71.1% in the first quarter, with favorable experience across most products. The 1Q 2021 ratio was below the prior year quarter of 71.7% and at the low end of our annual target range of 70% to 75%. Now let's turn to VII in the quarter on Page 6. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income over the last five quarters, including approximately $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2021. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 13.3% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag. Our first quarter results were essentially in line with private equity industry benchmarks, while all private equity classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 20% of our PE account balance of $10.3 billion were strongest performer across sub-sectors with a roughly 25% quarterly return due to a broad increase in tech company valuations. On Page 7, first quarter VII of $1.1 billion post-tax is shown by segment. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As noted previously, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly one-third each although it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. VII results in 1Q 2021 were more heavily weighted toward RIS and MetLife Holdings, as Asia's portfolio has a smaller proportion of the venture capital funds that I referenced earlier. Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters and full year 2020, including 11% in the first quarter of 2021. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. In 1Q 2021, our favorable direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline as well as delayed investment spending in the quarter. We expect the direct expense ratio for the remainder of 2021 to be consistent with our full year outlook. Now I will discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $3.8 billion at March 31, which is down from $4.5 billion at December 31, but well within our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $1 billion in the first quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Looking ahead, we expect holdco cash will be significantly higher in the second quarter as a result of the sale of our auto and home business to farmers insurance. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 392% at year-end 2020 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, excluding our Property & Casualty business, preliminary first quarter 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.5 billion, while statutory net income was approximately $570 million. Statutory operating earnings increased by roughly $2.3 billion year-over-year driven by lower VA rider reserves, an increase in interest margins, higher net investment income and lower operating expenses. Statutory net income, excluding our P&C business, increased by roughly $430 million year-over-year driven by higher operating earnings, partially offset by an increase in after-tax derivative losses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital, excluding P&C was approximately $16.7 billion as of March 31, down 2% compared to December 31. Favorable operating earnings were more than offset by after-tax derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 967% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. In summary, MetLife delivered another strong quarter, which benefited from exceptional private equity returns, solid business fundamentals and ongoing expense discipline. While higher mortality in the U.S. and Mexico dampened adjusted earnings in Group Benefits in Latin America, our financial performance demonstrates the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and position us for success. We are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler, more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Just to start, can you go into a bit more detail on the group life claims trends this quarter and the implications of population that's skewing younger, which it sounds like could mean higher severity? Is this something we should expect to have continued impact in the second quarter?
Ramy Tadros: Erik, it's Ramy here. As we've discussed in John's remarks, the group results this quarter were primarily a frequency effect. So we saw the significant increase in the total number of population deaths. And that was accompanied by a secondary effect, which is a severity effect, whereby we did see an increase in the percentage of claims under 65. And those claims, which tend to be for working employees, do have a higher face amount. So if you think about it and if you think about the outlook going forward, we're watching that composition very carefully. But I would say that the primary driver in the second quarter is still going to be the frequency, right? So as you know, with the rollout of the vaccine, the COVID related deaths in the population have been declining. If you do any comparison between, say, January average death number to April has been a significant decline. So while we still have a substantial number of deaths coming through, therefore, expect to see an elevated mortality ratio in the second quarter. We do expect the underwriting ratio to come down from its Q1 highs.
Erik Bass: And then maybe if we could turn to Asia? I was hoping you can provide some more color on the underlying growth dynamics there, where it seems like your sales and account value growth are both trending a bit stronger than many peers. Just wondering where you're seeing the best opportunities?
Kishore Ponnavolu: Erik, this is Kishore. So we did have a pretty strong quarter in terms of sales growth, 7% sequentially and 12% compared to prior year. This is certainly a good performance, especially given the COVID environment. Even in Japan, we had several prefectures under the state of emergency there during much of Q1. And then the other Asia markets had varying degrees of social distancing measures in place. Clearly, COVID and the resurgence here in Asia is a significant headwind given that the vast majority of our sales are face-to-face. However, as I mentioned earlier, the diversity of our channels and products, the strength of our bank partnerships and the strong execution focus of our businesses, that's what powers MetLife sales resiliency even in this tough environment. In addition, we've been making significant investments in digitizing our sales processes, all the way from video conferencing, co-browsing, remote closing and they've certainly aided our performance as well. As Michel mentioned in his opening remarks, 95% of our new sales application submissions in Japan are digital. And the other markets are in a similar range as well. For example, in China, almost all our agent onboarding and new business submissions are done digitally. Specifically with regards to Japan, it's, again, 8% up sequentially. And even after taking seasonality into account, our face-to-face channels that sell life and A&H products were quite resilient, while we recorded strong annuity sales growth to the bank channel. Clearly, we have strengthened the FX-denominated products and our bank relationships, and that strength shows. Other Asia, 8% up, sequentially up 30% year-over-year. Again, this speaks to, I think, the strength of our market presence across these markets and strong execution across the board. And our digital solutions are also helping us in a big way. With regards to the outlook for the rest of the year, we're very comfortable and on track to meet the full guidance of double-digit sales growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question is on capital. So you guys bought that $1 billion in the quarter. Just want to get a sense, any color that you can give in terms of how we should think about the quarterly run rate, given that you guys closed the Property & Casualty transaction in the second quarter. And given that you guys will have a good amount of capital coming from that deal, is there a certain level that we should think about you guys looking to have at the holdco above the normal buffer as you put those proceeds to work?
Michel Khalaf: Yes, hi, good morning Elyse, it's Michel. So let me start at a high level by just reiterating our philosophy and our approach, which is that beyond supporting organic growth and in the absence of strategic accretive risk-adjusted hurdle rate clearing M&A, excess capital belongs to our shareholders. And we define excess capital as cash or cash equivalents at our holding companies above our liquidity buffer, which is still the $3 billion to $4 billion that we've discussed. As you know, we bought back $1 billion in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash at our holding companies. So that's within our $3 billion to $4 billion buffer. And we did so with the full knowledge that we would close shortly on the sale of our P&C company and substantially boost our cash and excess capital position. We have $1.6 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization, which we will extinguish in 2021. And historically, we've managed our authorization deliberately and expeditiously, particularly in the wake of major divestments. So expect us to do the same here.
Elyse Greenspan: And then maybe my follow-up will build upon that. You guys announced this transaction, the P&C sale, late last year. And you've put it right that you'll balance capital return as well as, I think, looking at what M&A is potentially out there. So as you guys have kind of thought through kind of M&A plan, it's kind of five or so months since you announced the transaction, you guys have a sense of what type of businesses you would look to pursue deals? And as you look at transactions, multiples or anything may be more or less likely to go down the route of M&A?
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Again, here, I would just maybe start with sort of our approach and philosophy, which again, is - has been very consistent and no change there. So we will always look for M&A opportunities that fit our strategy that are accretive over time for our shareholders. We have a constant basis globally through which we evaluate opportunities based on value and cash generation. All M&A opportunities will need to earn more than their cost of capital. And we determine what we're willing to pay for a business by evaluating capital markets, the cost of raising capital and synergies. And acquisition opportunities will need to be more attractive than share repurchases. So what we do is we try to achieve a healthy balance between returning cash to our shareholders and investing in attractive future growth through M&A. And I think some of the sort of recent transactions that we've done, such as Versant Health last year, but first acquisition prior to that, Logan Circle a couple of years back, I think those give you a sense of sort of what that - sort of approach or strategy that I outlined. So no change here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Crédit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
Andrew Kligerman: Just a question on the private equity portfolio, which I think John cited venture capital is 20% of $10.3 billion and generated a 25% return in the first quarter. Met has always seemed in the last years like a prominent name in venture capital. Could you flesh out that story a little bit more? How much does Met invest each year in venture capital? Are there particular areas of VC that are strengths? Just very interested in that area and the prospects at MetLife?
Steve Goulart: Andrew, it's Steve Goulart. Good morning. Let me talk a little bit about the overall strategy because we've been investing in private equity for a number of years and have always felt it to be a very strong component of our overall strategy. Venture capital, of course, is a significant portion of the portfolio. But basically, we take a look at this portfolio the same way we look at our credit portfolio, our real estate portfolio. It's about diversification, and that's what we've really tried to build in this. Again, just sort of recapping some of the numbers. Our PE portfolio produced income of almost $1.3 billion or 13.3% return. Again, Venture capital was - led the way as far as its total return. But think about what was happening in the market, too, with a lot of IPO activity and the like of things that Michel cited in his comments. So the important thing is that our returns were attractive across the portfolio, and I'd look at things like our LBO portfolio both domestically and in Europe. And again, this reflects the diversity that's in the entire portfolio and when we look to invest, we continue to invest in a diverse way across all the different sectors as well. I mean, just to give you a little bit more flavor on it. We have over 600 funds that we've invested in. We have almost 200 managers. So, again, very broad, very deep exposure across all the sectors of private equity. And again, I think you have to take into consideration what was happening in the environment, and when we think about it, despite the pandemic, equity valuations continued decline in the fourth quarter. The combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus continued to be major contributors that led to strong equity performance really across all sectors. And so I would think about it in that respect that we really think of this as a diversified private equity portfolio. Now that all said, we do think that the past quarter was probably something of an anomaly because when we look at our historical experience, at least until this quarter. Now, it has been that our PE returns have always been moderated versus the S&P 500, particularly in high market return quarters. So this was an unusual quarter in that respect. And when we think about future returns or relationships, we still think that what we've been saying for the last couple of years as far as our plans go, the kind of low single - or low double-digits 12% is still the right way for us to think about these returns. Again, it's going to be vary quarter-by-quarter, but that's how we think about this on a long-term basis and again, it just reflects our continued efforts to have a very diversified portfolio across all sectors.
Andrew Kligerman: Sounds like it's a real area of excellence in we see though but I'll move on from that. And then Erik was asking a question earlier about Asian - sales in the Asia region, and I'm still trying to reconcile those numbers with what we've been seeing as other companies, which is sales pressures flattish premium growth, and MET being - having a very large proportion of its business in Japan, which is a more mature market. It's just kind of striking to see 12% year-over-year sales growth and then a target of double-digit. So, if you could flesh that out a little bit more specifically, is it the banks that are driving the sales growth in Japan, and what particular other countries are kind of driving growth in other parts of Asia.
John McCallion: Sure, Andrew. So, if you - if we parse out the total Asia sales into Japan and other Asia, they will pretend for a minute. While sequentially and even on the previous calls right, we've been making steady progress in Japan sales since Q2, right? Q3 was better than Q2, last year Q4 was better than Q3. And Q1 is a build off of Q4 from last year. And if you then say, okay, where is this coming from? A couple of things. We have three broad product lines, life, A&H and annuities. And then we have a couple of channels, right? We've got essentially what I would broadly classify as face-to-face channels. We can go further breakdown of that, but that's not needed for this call and - the good news for us is even in this tough environment, our face-to-face channels were pretty resilient from a year-over-year perspective. There's a little bit of pressure on A&H, but our life segment pretty much held flat. And then much of the growth came in from the annuities, which are primarily sold through banks. And in the previous calls, I talked a lot about our advantages in the annuity space on the FX because these are all foreign currency or dollar denominated. And we have many advantages that we bring to the table on that and also the strength of the bank partnerships that we bring to the table as well. So because of that, because of this diversification of products and diversification of channels and our lean in on our strengths that's basically contributed to the resiliency of our sales in Japan. Now with regards to - and by the way, this has not been easy. I have to tell you that. But our teams on the ground have done, I think, a fantastic job with regards to that. Now again, this is playing out, right? I can't sit here and say, this is definitive because COVID is a factor that's an ongoing concern across Asia. With regards to other Asia, again, very strong sales growth. But remember, last year, the pressure started early outside of Japan, in China, right, because of COVID. And so the year-over-year comparisons look very favorable on the other Asia segment. But again, I think I'd lean more on the strength of our businesses and our market presence in terms of how we've executed this quarter. Korea was very strong in terms of performance. India was also strong in performance from a sales perspective. We've recovered nicely in China, which is a major factor. Again, COVID is still a factor in all these markets. And we continue to stay focused on execution. At the end, that's what it boils down to. I hope that helps. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Just a question on RIS spreads declining excluding VII. I think John McCallion, I know you mentioned last quarter that the over 100 basis point spread level was probably not sustainable. But I guess, the big drop back into the high 80s seemed a bit surprising to me. Question is, is that now a good level to run rate? Or would you expect to trend up or down? And any color as to why such a large sequential drop?
John McCallion: Good morning, Tom, sorry for the voice. Just overcoming little COVID recovery here. So all right, let me try to take that. Look, it's probably not going to go too far back because that was the whole reason we gave you in guidance, right? But look, we talked about some pretty large one-time items in the third and fourth quarter last year from prepayments and other things like that. And we knew those things weren't going to recur. And so those - that's probably one item. Second is we did reference that new re-class and real estate funds up into VII. And that probably cost another four points of shift. So we really kind of migrate back to the range. I mean I wouldn't go backwards so much as I would think about how we look relative to the guidance we gave in February. And I think we're right in line, I mean, maybe even slightly above this quarter. But honestly, the 80s is probably a little above. And I think the outlook, putting aside yet VII, is intact. 
Tom Gallagher: Appreciate it, John. Hope you recover soon. Sorry to draw you into the call, too. But the - I guess my only follow-up is maybe for Steve Goulart. The - just a reminder, VII, does that no longer include prepayment income? Or does prepayment income still included in that number? 
Steve Goulart: Prepayment income is still in that number. It's just dwarfed by our alternative income. They're fairly modest on the prepayments. 
John McCallion: Yes. Let me clarify where you're going. So, that - I'm not talking about prepayment income when I said that there were prepayment activities impacting the non-VII spread in the third and fourth quarter. What happened was we saw just a real jump in refinancing, and that was impacting the RMBS securities and how they were running off. And that was having a jump in our non-VII spread. So, hopefully, that helps. 
Tom Gallagher: That does. And Steve, just to clarify, could you quantify, of the $1.4 billion of VII, how much is prepayment income?
John Hall: Yes. Tom, this is John Hall. We typically haven't broken out that number, but if you got your ruler out and you took a real careful measurement of that table in the supplemental slides, you could probably reasonably get close. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. I wanted to start with the direct expense ratio guide, just so I understand it, obviously came in much better in the first quarter. In terms of your comments about the next couple of quarters, is the expectation that you'll be sort of above your 12.3% BRIC, get the full year to land around 12.3%? Or is it the expectation over the next few quarters that you'll be somewhere around 12.3%, so you could end up with a lower full year number? I just didn't quite get the guide there.
Michel Khalaf: Yes. I'm not sure - hi Suneet, Michel. I'm not sure we provided a guide, but let me just remind of what we said on the outlook, which is that this year's expense ratio will be pressured because of the sale of P&C, which has a lower direct expense ratio and that we would expect to get back to at or below the 12.3% by 2022. Now, obviously, we came in at 11% in Q1. A few factors that contributed to this. One is the PFO growth, obviously. And I think there were - in John's comments, we mentioned some of the impact of participating group life contracts, for example, on that PFO growth. Versant was an important also factor there. Then we had really good expense discipline across our businesses. And we did have also some, I would say, timing related expenses that maybe benefited us by about 25 basis points. So our expectation for the second to fourth quarter is that the expense ratio will be consistent with our full year outlook guidance. And as I said, we believe that 12.3% is the right level for us, because that allows us to continue to make important investments in our business. So no change in terms of how you should look at the balance of the year.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then just - sorry. Go ahead.
John McCallion: Suneet, I'll just add that, like, just to the point on the guide, we give an annual guide. This quarter came in much better than we thought. But if you adjust for this quarter and think about the rest, we're expecting to be slightly above this year, but trending well. 
Suneet Kamath: And then just on the Group Benefits business, I was just wondering if you could unpack some of the growth rates that we're seeing. PFOs, I think, were up 16%. How much of that was Versant versus the other parts of the business? And then on the sales growth, up 45%, can you just give a little color in terms of what's behind that? How much of it is sort of new clients, headcount increases or new products? Just so we get a sense of where the growth is coming from.
Ramy Tadros: Hi, Suneet, it's Ramy here. So I'll start off with the sales. We're really pleased with our performance this quarter. And as John mentioned, 2021 is shaping up to be a record year for us in terms of Group Benefits. I would say the three drivers of sales; the first one is a significant uptick in the jumbo activity in national accounts. Now that's coming off a low in 2020, but this is our sweet spot. This is where we excel, and we've done exceptionally well this quarter there. I would also remind you, just for jumbo accounts, these sales can be lumpy from year-to-year. Beyond that, if you look at products and markets, we've just seen, I would say, strength across the board from a product perspective, as well as increased sales in both regional and small. So it's pretty even. And then, the last driver of sales I would point to is, we continue to successfully execute on our enrollment and reenrollment strategy at the worksite that we've talked about on prior occasions. So we're seeing pretty strong underlying sales growth there.  When it comes to PFO growth, which we think is the actual measure that best captures the top line of this business; you really need to peel back from that 16%, 5 points due to these participating contracts. So think about 11 as the underlying growth there, and that is in line with our expectations and in line with our outlook. So we're very pleased with that result as well. And the PFO drivers, in addition to sales, would be strong persistency. We continue to see very high persistency with our customers. And our value proposition is resonating with those customers, and they're doing more business with us. We're getting all of our rate actions at renewals also in line with our expectations. And then also what's driving the PFO number, coming back to that reenrollment strategy, is very disciplined execution of our voluntary strategy in the work site. And so, we continue to see those double-digit growth in voluntary in that PFO number.
Suneet Kamath: Great. How much of that 11% was Versant? Are you able to spike that out?
Ramy Tadros: We don't break that out. At the transaction, we did indicate that we that we expected to add about $1.3 billion of PFO from Versant in the year. So you can use that as a framework.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ward from UBS. Please go ahead.
Mike Ward: Thank you, guys. Good morning. I just had a higher-level question on holdings. Interest rates have come up a bit this year, they're still pretty low, but COVID is kind of subsiding. Would you say there's an uptick in conversations on potential derisking there? If and when the time comes, just curious if you could comment at all maybe on which lines there that you're thinking you might want to work on first.
John McCallion: Hi Mike. Good to hear you. Yeah. So, I'd say things are trending positively in the space. It's still slow. Rates are still low. Spreads are wide. But things are emerging. And I think our philosophy has been to just continue to be ready. But it's - there's a lot of activity and we're just going to make sure we're ready to act if something is value accretive. So I don't think there's any material change from the last call. 
Mike Ward: Thanks, John. I appreciate that. And then just on the P&C proceeds, I know you said going to be thoughtful and balanced. And you've got a solid track record, but this is a solid amount of capital there. So I was just wondering if there was any more detail you could give around if there's nothing inorganic out there, what the buyback run rate might look like as we move forward. Thanks.
Michel Khalaf: Hi, Mike. I mean, I would just refer you back to our overall sort of approach and philosophy and the track record also post divestment. And I think that should give you a good sense of how we would sort of move forward here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead. 
Ryan Krueger: Ramy, can you provide some more underlying details on the non-medical health underwriting trends you saw in the quarter, both in dental and vision utilization and disability experience? 
Ramy Tadros: Sure. So I'll keep this brief. In the quarter, the two I'll point out to, one is dental. We did see some benefit from lower utilization early in the quarter. But as we expected, the utilization normalized back in line with historical levels as the quarter progressed. And then in disability, we're still seeing very favorable results. We saw a slight uptick in incidence rates from years ago, but we continue to see positive trends on recoverability there.
Operator: And it seems we have no time for any further questions, I would like to now turn the call back to Michel Khalaf for any closing remarks.
Michel Khalaf: Great, thank you. So let me close by saying that we're very pleased with our first quarter financial results. While they were puts and takes with variable investment income and mortality, our underlying results showed both strength and positive momentum across our business segment. We consider the quarter's results and other installment on our commitment to consistent execution and we look forward to continuing to generate long term value for all our stakeholders. Thank you for joining us this morning and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-04 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Release and Outlook Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday’s earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife’s SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife’s fourth quarter 2020 earnings and near-term outlook call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter, as well as our near-term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks, if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In light of the busy morning Q&A will extend no further than the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. No matter which lens to use to look at MetLife’s performance. The fourth quarter, full year 2020 or the progress we have made toward our Next Horizon strategy, the portrait that emerges is one of a resilient company with consistent execution that delivers for its stakeholders. The year 2020 was an especially unforgiving environment for life insurance, marked by the worst pandemic in a century, record low interest rates and extreme market volatility, and yet at MetLife by reducing and diversifying our risk, controlling expenses, staying true to our investment principles and executing on our capital deployment philosophy, we overcame these challenges to produce strong earnings, cash and book value per share growth. Let’s begin with our fourth quarter 2020 results. As you saw last night, we delivered quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $2.03 per share. One of the primary drivers was the exceptionally strong returns we earned on our private equity portfolio, which has long been an important source of value creation for MetLife. Overall, adjusted earnings excluding notables rose 30% year-over-year. Just as noteworthy during the quarter was the resilience of our business in the face of COVID-19. MetLife balanced risk exposure across the spectrum of mortality, morbidity and longevity was clearly evident in the quarter and the year. Certain parts of our business experienced significant adverse mortality, such as Group Life and Mexico. But those effects were more than offset by lower utilization in Group and EMEA and favorable underwriting in MetLife Holdings. We believe the strong diversification of our businesses represents a meaningful differentiator for MetLife and the current crisis and beyond. If we look at 2020 as a whole, some additional attributes of MetLife culture, strategy and performance come into view. I must begin by commending the way MetLife people stepped up for each other and our customers during the pandemic. That is our very purpose as a company to provide financial protection and support for people during life’s most destabilizing moments. The pandemic was one of those moments for so many people who rely on MetLife and we were pleased to go above and beyond for them and for our broader communities. Between premium credits and contributions from the MetLife Foundation, we provided more than $0.25 billion of relief to help people cope with COVID-19. What enabled us to preserve our financial strength through the crisis was having the right strategy and an unwavering commitment to execution. We are a less interest sensitive company than we used to be. In a year where the 10-year Treasuries spent nine months below 1%, we delivered and adjusted return on equity, excluding notables of 12.3% and the positive earnings impact from volume growth significantly outweighed the drag from lower recurring investment income. That volume growth showed up in a number of ways. We recorded our second highest year of pension risk transfer sales ever, our stable value sales jumped significantly helping our reported liability balances within retirement and income solutions to grow by a very strong 14% and we successfully entered the U.K. longevity reinsurance market, where we see the potential for additional deals. Our expense discipline, which is one of the most critical levers we control was exceptional. We promised to deliver a 2020 direct expense ratio of 12.3%. Despite the challenges we face during the year, our actual direct expense ratio came in at 12% or 30 basis points lower. Year-over-year this represents an enterprise-wide direct expense reduction of roughly $300 million. All while continuing to make critical technology investments to improve the customer experience. Our cash generation, the ultimate measure of value creation was strong. We ended the year with $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at the holding company. This is well above the top end of our target buffer and comes during the year when we deployed approximately $4.5 billion toward common stock dividends, share repurchases and accretive M&A in addition to continuing to invest in new business growth. M&A remains a strategic asset for MetLife and a key tool as we evolve our portfolio to in the future. For example, we have long had the premier Group Benefits platform in the life insurance space and continue to deepen our competitive advantage in this highly profitable business. In 2019, we announced a suite of attractive new voluntary benefits, digital well, health savings accounts and pet insurance. In 2020, we grew Group Benefits adjusted PFOs by 5% and position the business for double-digit adjusted PFO growth in 2021 with the acquisition of Versant Health. And in the second quarter of this year, we expect to close on the sale of MetLife Auto & Home to Farmers Insurance. This transaction includes a 10-year strategic partnership that allows each company to do what it does best. Farmers to manufacture high quality P&C products and MetLife to distribute those products through the 3,800 employers in our U.S. Group Benefits network. At MetLife, the process of planting and proning to ensure we have the optimal business mix is nothing new. In 2020, we closed on the sale of our Hong Kong business, sold our Argentina Annuity business and agreed to sell our Russia business, which closed last month. I am so proud of what the team at MetLife has been able to accomplish during an atmosphere of disruption and chaos. I have heard 2020 referred to as the last year. For MetLife, it was anything but we seized on the opportunities in front of us and we will use our momentum as a springboard to emerge from the crisis in even stronger shape. Consider our P&C divestiture, we expect the accretion benefits will start to materialize in 2021 and will drive double-digit earnings per share growth in 2022. If we pull back further and look at MetLife’s performance relative to our Next Horizon strategy, and to the commitments we made at our Investor Day in December 2019, we remained firmly on track. This was far from a given in light of the unprecedented challenges we faced in 2020. As a reminder, three of our anchoring commitments were; first, maintain a two-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75%; second, preserve a $3 billion to $4 billion cash buffer; and third, generate approximately $20 billion of free cash flow over five years. We are confident in our ability to achieve each of these commitments. As you know, based on market conditions at the end of March, we discussed a scenario in which our free cash flow ratio could fall below our two-year average target range of 65% to 75%. As John will discuss later, this is not a scenario we currently contemplate and we are affirming a 65% to 75% target range for our near-term outlook. As I mentioned earlier, the cash balance at our holding companies at the end of the year totaled $4.5 billion. Keep in mind that we expect to receive $3.5 billion in net cash and perhaps most impressive, given the economic backdrop, we remain on course to generate approximately $20 billion of free cash flow over the five-year period from 2020 through 2024, an amount equal to more than 40% of our current market cap. We believe that no matter which lens you use, the evidence of MetLife transformation is clear. It begins with our purpose of building a more confident future for all. By inspiring and enabling our people to deliver for our customers, we create value that extends to our shareholders and communities. Our commitment to preserving MetLife’s financial strength is really just another way of saying that we will always keep our promises and manage this company sustainably for the long run. This requires discipline, determination and dedication to consistent performance. More than ever, we are convinced that we have the right ingredients to generate strong value creation, a sound strategy and attractive set of businesses and the management team with a relentless focus on execution. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our financial results in greater detail and to discuss our 2021 outlook.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q ‘20 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions, and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in the quarter was $124 million or $1.7 billion lower than adjusted earnings. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses from higher long-term interest rates and stronger equity markets. For the full year net income of $5.2 billion, which included net derivative gains of $1.1 billion was more in line with adjusted earnings. Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continued to perform as expected. On page four, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment. This comparison excludes net favorable notable items of $420 million in the fourth quarter of ‘19, which were accounted for in corporate and other. Excluding such items, adjusted earnings per share were up 33% and 34% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the segments, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 16% year-over-year, driven by expense margins, underwriting and volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 96.3%, which is above the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90% and included roughly 9 percentage points related to COVID-19 claims. For group non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 61.7%, lower annual target range of 72% to 77%, due to favorable dental and disability results. The higher dental utilization at the end of the third quarter did not continue in 4Q as we had anticipated, most likely due to the resurgence in COVID-19 cases. Turning to topline. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 10% year-over-year on solid product growth, as well as the release of approximately $200 million of the remaining on earned dental premium reserve established in 2Q. Excluding this reserve release, Group Benefits PFO growth fell within our annual target range of 46%. Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 64% year-over-year. The primary drivers were strong investment margins, mostly due to higher variable investment income and volume growth. RIS investment spreads were 177 basis points, up 71 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads excluding VII were 104 basis points, up 21 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures, excluding U.K. longevity reinsurance grew 14.3% year-over-year, due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio, as well as separate account investment performance. We completed five pension risk transfer deals, totaling $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter, a very strong result. For the full year of 2020, PRT sales were $4.7 billion. As Michel noted, that was our second highest year ever and we see a good pipeline going forward in 2021. Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings of $112 million were up $87 million, as fewer miles driven lead to favorable auto underwriting margins. As previously announced, we expect to close a sale of the Auto & Home business to Farmer’s Insurance in the second quarter. The purchase price is not subject to any adjustment for changes to the business performance or economic conditions from the deal announcement through closing. And starting with the first quarter of 2021, Property & Casualty results will be reflected as a divested business in our financial statements and excluded from adjusted earnings for all of 2021. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 45% and 42% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income, as well as favorable underwriting, volume growth and expense margins. Asia’s solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 5% on a constant currency basis. Latin America adjusted earnings were down $139 million on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting. Elevated COVID-19 related claims, primarily in Mexico impacted Latin America’s adjusted earnings by approximately $160 million after-tax. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 23% and 27% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by favorable expense and underwriting margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 58%. This increase was primarily driven by higher private equity returns, as well as favorable Long Term Care underwriting and expense margins. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.6%, higher than the prior year quarter of 55.5% and our annual target range of 50% to 55%. While, life claims were elevated due to COVID-19, this was more than offset by favorable Long Term Care results, which benefited from both lower claim incidence and higher policy termination rates. Corporate and another adjusted loss was $198 million. This result is consistent with the expectation that we laid out for the second half of 2020. The company’s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20% at the bottom of our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. On page five, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2020. VII was $778 million in the fourth quarter. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had an 8.4% return in the quarter. For the full year of 2020, VII was $1.2 billion and above our 2020 target range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This outperformance was primarily attributable to exceptional private equity returns in the second half of the year. On page six, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. The attribution of VII by business segment is based on the quarterly returns for each segment individual portfolio. As a general rule of thumb, MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia will account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split around one-third each. Turning to page seven, this chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2020 and each quarter of 2020. In 4Q, our direct expense ratio was 12.3%. More significantly, our full year 2020 direct expense ratio was 12% and better than our annual target of 12.3%. Our five-year goal was to realize at least $800 million of pretax profit margin improvement by 2020, which represents an approximate 200 basis point decline from the 2015 baseline year. We exceeded that goal, and reduced our direct expense ratio by 230 basis points, clearly demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on page eight. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at December 31st, which is down from $7.8 billion at September 30th, but still above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the completion of the Versant Health acquisition and the previously discussed redemption of preferred stock. Further cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $571 million in the fourth quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In 2020, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases. So far in 2021, we have repurchased another $434 million of shares, with roughly $2.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. For the two-year period, 2019 and 2020, our free cash flow ratio excluding notable items totaled 78%, which was above the high end of our 65% to 75% target range. In terms of statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2020 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2020 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $4.3 billion, while net income was approximately $3.6 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $19.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Operating earnings more than offset dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 906% as of September 30th, which is the latest public data. Before I shift to our near-term outlook on page 10, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on page 14 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife major segments updated for 2019. We continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. MetLife invested $3.8 billion of capital in 2019 to support new business, which was deployed in an average unlevered IRR of approximately 15% with a payback period of seven years. Also pages 15 to 18 provide interest rate assumptions and key sensitivities by line of business. Turning back to slide 10, a macro environment remains uncertain and we expect COVID-19 impacts to remain with us through the first half of 2021. Also, we expect pent-up demand in certain utilization products to emerge in 2021, albeit more noticeably post-first quarter. While we expect interest rates will remain low, the steepening of the yield curve has helped support our investment spreads. Finally, based on the forward curve, the U.S. dollar is expected to weaken. Moving to near-term targets, we are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 12% to 14%. Despite the headwinds associated with the lower interest rates and the realized gain from the sale of our P&C business, we expect to migrate back to the range over the near term period. We also expect to maintain our two-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. In the early part of 2020, we presented a scenario based on economic conditions as of March 31st, indicating that such conditions for an extended period of time could pressure our free cash flow ratio. However, since then, macroeconomic conditions, credit markets, as well as the company’s business mix and performance have been resilient and support our current outlook. In addition, we remain committed to maintaining a direct expense ratio below 12.3%, while the sale of the P&C operation will put pressure on this target in 2021 due to its lower expense ratio. We expect to be back below the target starting in 2022 as a result of our commitment to an efficiency mindset. We are raising our VII guidance range in 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We project private equity to remain strong in 2021. Our plan assumes a 12% annual return on an average balance of approximately $9 billion. In addition, a portion of our real estate exposure has been shifting from direct ownership to indirect ownership through certain real estate funds. The net result will be a migration of around $100 million of recurring net investment income to VII in 2021 and beyond. Our Corporate and Other adjusted losses expected to remain $650 million to $750 million after tax and we are maintaining our effective tax rate of 20% to 22%. At the bottom of the page, you will see expected key interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, which incorporates the forward curve as of December 31st. The takeaways that the changes in interest rates are expected to have a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near-term. So now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Our comments will be anchored off full year 2020 reported results in our QFS, unless otherwise noted. Let’s start with the U.S. on page 11. For Group Benefits, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to have low double-digit growth in 2021, aided by the Versant Health acquisition. Following 2021, we expect topline growth to revert to our historical target range of 4% to 6% annually. Regarding underwriting, we expect the annual Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%. However, we do expect the first quarter of 2021 Group Life mortality ratio to be above the range as COVID-19-related mortality remains elevated. The group non-medical health interested adjusted benefit ratio of 65.3% in 2020 was extremely favorable, driven by unusually low utilization in dental and lower incidents in disability. Although, we do not believe the 2020 ratio is sustainable, dental utilization remains low so far in ‘21. In addition, we are lowering our expected annual group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio to 70% to 75% from 72% to 77%. The reduction reflects our continued shift in business mix towards products with lower benefit ratios including voluntary products and the addition of Versant Health. For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread business and fee-based businesses. We are also maintaining our expected annual RIS investment spread of 90 basis points to 115 basis points in 2021. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline between 5% to 7% annually, roughly consistent with the natural run-off of this legacy business. While the topline continues to decline, we are widening our adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2021. Finally, we are also maintaining the life interest adjusted benefit ratio of 50% to 55% in 2021. While COVID-19-related life claims are expected to remain elevated in the first half of 2021, this will be more than offset by the benefit from a lower approved policyholder dividend scale. Now let’s look at our non-U.S. businesses near-term guidance on page 12, which is presented on a reported basis for adjusted earnings and PFOs, and on a constant currency basis for sales in AUM. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate double-digit growth in 2021, followed by mid-to-high single-digit growth in ‘22 and ‘23. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid single-digit growth. We are expecting adjusted earnings to be essentially flat in 2021 increasing the mid single-digit growth in ‘22 and ‘23. Our Latin America business has been the most negatively impacted by COVID-19 and the environment remains less certain as vaccine protocols are still emerging. Given this backdrop, we expect adjusted PFOs to have high single-to-low double-digit annual growth over the near-term. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings to grow high-teens aided by favorable FX impacts of approximately $25 million. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2020 with gradual improvement, particularly in the second half of the year. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect Latin America’s adjusted earnings to return to 2019 levels. In the contrast to Latin America, EMEA had a very strong 2020, benefiting from lower utilization in group medical in accident and health businesses due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. Regarding the topline, we expect EMEA sales and adjusted PFOs to grow mid-to-high single-digit over the near-term, given the unsustainable benefit ratio in 2020 we expected EMEA’s adjusted earnings to grow low-to-mid single-digits against the more appropriate base line year of 2019. Let me conclude by saying, MetLife delivered another strong quarter to close out a very strong year, fulfilling our financial commitment to shareholders and keeping our promises to customers. Our capital liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well-position to manage through this challenging environment and come out stronger. We are confident to the actions we are taking to be a simpler, more focused company, will continue to create long-term, sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the Operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Hi. Thank you. Can you talk about your preferred uses for the proceeds from the P&C business and do you have a timeframe over which you expect fully deploy the access capital closing the transaction?
Michel Khalaf: Yeah. Hi, Erik, Michel. So let me start by just reiterating and you have heard me say this many times that, we believe excess capital above and beyond what’s required to fund organic growth belongs to our shareholders and we would use it for share repurchases, common dividends and strategic acquisitions that clearer risk adjusted hurdle rate. So no change there and that’s why we also announced in December that our Board has approved a new 3 billion buyback authorization. We repurchased 571 million of MetLife shares in the fourth quarter. In total for the year, we repurchased approximately 1.2 billion, and so far in 2021, we have repurchase another 434 million shares. So we still have roughly 2.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. We would expect to complete the new 3 billion authorization in 2021. And look, I think, we have also built a track record here of being deliberate in how we manage capital. So expect that to once we complete the current authorization, we will review assess the environment and then we would have a discussion with our Board about potentially a new authorization. So I hope that gives you a bit of color in terms of how we would sort of use the proceeds.
Erik Bass: Yes. Thank you. And then, secondly, can you talk about the outlook for RIS spreads? Why doesn’t the spread range for 2021 increase given the benefits that we have seen from the steeper yield curve, as well as the higher outlook for the VII in 2021?
John McCallion: Good morning, Erik. It’s John. Look, I think that we have had some strong performance in 2020 to -- and we should recognize that VIII obviously came in very strong. We have also had -- we have had some kind of one-time pops, I will say, and we talked about this in the third quarter from things like we had some higher prepayment activity on some RMBS securities that were purchased at a discount several years ago. We actually saw that continue into the fourth quarter. So all-in-all, the way we see it is, we are able to maintain spreads despite the low rate environment. I think it’s -- we are not immune to low rates, but I think we have a number of diverse set of products and businesses that where some perform well and low rates. And others, quite honestly, there is some roll-off reinvest risk. So all-in-all, we are very pleased to be able to maintain the spread guidance that we gave a year ago and I think we are happy with the outlook.
Erik Bass: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Crédit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kligerman: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just to follow-up on the last question, with regard to the environment for M&A is, are you -- are there more Versants out there that might be of interest to you. What are you seeing out there that might be of interest? And is there a lot of activity going on? And on the flip side with regard to MetLife Holdings, is there a heightened interest in your -- in annuity blocks in life blocks, in LTC? What are you seeing in that environment with necessarily specifically commenting on that?
Michel Khalaf: Yeah. Hi, Andrew. It’s Michel. Let me start and then John will talk to you about Holdings. What I would -- let me start by saying that, we are quite happy pleased with our portfolio of businesses. We don’t see -- I don’t see any major gaps there. We look at M&A as sort of a strategic capability here. But we also have an approach -- a global consistent approach in how we look at M&A opportunities from a strategic set perspective. They -- those opportunities would need to earn more than their cost of capital. We also look at potential M&A in terms of it being more attractive than share. And we also seek to sort of achieve a healthy balance between returning capital to our shareholders and investing in attractive future growth through M&A. So that’s really the approach here. But if you were to ask me about sort of any gaps that we see, I would say, we don’t see any major gaps in terms of our portfolio of businesses. And let me turn it over to John.
John McCallion: Good morning, Andrew. Yeah. I would say that there is not a lot to update on relative to what back in the third quarter. Obviously, as I mentioned then, we do see that there’s kind of a supply of capital out there that’s starting to pick up. I think that’s a good thing. Obviously rates rising is a good thing. And as I said before, part of our process in holdings is, we take a third-party external perspective of this business. We are working through different combinations, ideas, to think about how do we optimize and optimization can be how do we do things better internally to manage this business, as well as look for ways that there might be kind of a value enhancing transaction for us and for someone else. But no one transaction can be replicated. I think that’s certainly one thing we have all learned. I think everyone has a unique situation and so we are working through -- we worked through our own and see if we can find an optimal solution. But we don’t have to do anything. I think that’s important. We have some pretty, I’d say, best-in-class capabilities to manage the run-off, but nonetheless, we continue to take a third-party and external perspective.
Andrew Kligerman: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just the follow-up would be, there’s a lot of talk now that we are pretty deep into COVID that there’s kind of a pull-forward on claims and so forth. So we have seen a financial benefit to the LTC line, and of course, in MetLife Holdings also the negative impacts on mortality. So could you talk how you see that affecting your mortality and your Long Term Care claim, respectively, going forward maybe into later ‘21 or ‘22? Do you think there will be any differences that we see going forward?
John McCallion: Yeah. It’s tough, Andrew, to really handicap that at this point. I mean, it’s -- certainly we saw across, I’d say, all key trends there was some favorability in LTC this quarter and that’s probably the first quarter where we had kind of all drivers claim insurance was down, higher claim in policy termination rates, average claims size was a little lower. So -- we did see that. We still believe at this juncture and our long-term view is this is an aberration and a short short-term aberration that will revert back to trend. But I think it’s something that we will need to monitor closely and continue evaluate as more data comes available.
Andrew Kligerman: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Good morning. One question I had is, John, I think you have mentioned your LTC block is hedged on the interest rate side for about five years. If the long end of the curve keeps moving higher and we get a bit of a reflection move here for the next couple of years, would you guys plan on extending the rate protection back in that block to further protect and immunize that business? Is that something you are contemplating right now?
John McCallion: I would say we always contemplate updating our ALM and hedging across all portfolios, not just LTC. It’s a -- it’s proven to be a very valuable tool to constantly evaluate, look at different opportunities, develop the play books, be ready when things change, not reactive but proactive. So we would obviously consider that. Now, as you said, we are well-hedged from an interest rate perspective in LTC. Also there’s just some inherent natural offsets in Long Term Care. So it depends what drives rates up, right? So you talked about inflation, you got to be careful about inflation, when it comes to Long Term Care, because that can have an offsetting effect. That can also help mitigate sometimes when rates get low. So all those things have to be considered.
Tom Gallagher: Got you. And then my follow-up is just on Asia, I thought that the guidance there was pretty constructive, mid-single digits in 2022, ‘23, that certainly compares very favorably to the big Japanese competitors. Is there something that’s different about your Japanese business or would you say, it’s your non-Japanese/Asian businesses are just growing a lot faster that are offsetting it? Can you provide a little color for what’s allowing Met to hold up better than others?
Kishore Ponnavolu: This is Kishore. Thank you very much for that question. Certainly, one of the -- and this -- we referenced this before, a few strengths for our Japanese business is; number one, is the diversified channel mix that we have. We play across multiple channels. And we are strong in bank up, we have 120 plus banker relationships that run for quite extended periods with a lot of depth there. We also are very strong player in the IA channel, where our relationships with some of our federated agents run many, many, many, many years and similar to the large agencies as well. In addition, we have a fantastic resilient courier agency channel, which we have been investing in, and for the past couple years we have actually made significant investments in that channel for growth as well. And similarly on the product side, we are also well-diversified with a focus on annuity, as well as A&H and as well as life, and so play in all segments of that too. So that’s a pretty different orientation with regards to that. Now, certainly, the other area also helps to that story, because we are in a number of markets where the growth is pretty aggressive. And you saw that play out over the last couple of years and that’s -- and we expect that to play out down the road as well. Thank you.
Tom Gallagher: Thanks. Thanks, Kishore.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. So, first, just had a question on main trends in the Group business, you mentioned dental utilization is favorable. I am assuming it’s not as good as it was or as low as it was early last year, but if you could talk about that? What -- also what you are seeing for disability claims and how much of an offset do you think these will lead to elevated Group Life claims in this yea?
Ramy Tadros: Sure. Jimmy, it’s Ramy here. So let me just first kind of describe the first quarter for you and maybe 2020 in general. So for dental, we did see a significant depth as COVID hit and the dental offices were closed. And as you recall at the time, because of lack of availability of services, we did setup an unearned premium reserve back in the second quarter. From utilization perspective, we did expect some sort of catch-up effect or pent-up demand and we did see some of that in the third quarter, but in the fourth quarter, that kind of pulled back. And in particular it pulled back for preventative services. So think regular checkups, cleanings, et cetera. And as we go into Q1 for dental, we are still seeing some softness in the utilization. So it is coming in below expectations, again driven by those preventative services. So that’s kind of the dental picture last year and coming into this quarter in terms of why we have visibility into. For disability, just as I mentioned whereas book for use. So disability is about 12% of our PFO. A third of that book is short-term disability and two-thirds is long-term disability. So for the STD book, it’s not really a macro unemployment story, it’s really all about injuries and minor surgeries, et cetera. And what we have seen in that book last year and what we continue to see this year so far is the rising COVID claims, have been basically offset by a decrease in some of the other claims with respect to injuries. So it’s basically flat on the STD portion of the book. The LTD portion of the book is continues to be favorable. Now if past recessions are any guide, you would expect to see some impact in terms of frequency and recoveries on the LTD book. We typically see those impacts coming in with a lag. We continue to monitor this very carefully. But we are not yet seeing any unfavorability quite there, we are seeing favorability rather in terms of frequency for the LTD book so far.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thanks. And then just a question on the -- obviously your operating income was very strong, but net income was not as much and you had a large derivative loss. So I think you have mentioned that a majority of these derivatives are -- or the loss is uneconomic or it’s hedging loss. But is a portion of it economic and how do you think about sort of below the line versus above the line, just the difference between operating versus net.
Michel Khalaf: Good morning, Jimmy. So, first, yes, that’s the case for the fourth quarter. I mean, if you look full year, I think, they are much more aligned and that’s been the case now for some time. So we are going to see volatility on a quarterly basis and that should not be a surprise. But, yeah, it is part of our hedging program. Obviously, we put some of that mark-to-market non-cash time horizon below the line, just because the -- what we are hedging doesn’t move in the same direction, so it could be confusing otherwise. And yeah, I think, as markets rise and you saw equity markets rise significantly, you can think that’s where predominant level of our losses came. Also interest rates rose, so that’s another place. So I would say as expected would be the punch line for us and very pleased with how it’s performed so far.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hi. Good morning. Can you comment on the key drivers of the expected upside to your ROE getting back to the 12% to 14% target over the next few years?
John McCallion: Hey, Ryan. It’s John. So, as you mentioned, we said in our outlook that, we are comfortable with migrating back to the target of 12% to 14%. As I mentioned in my opening remarks a few things, for certainly next year and to some degree into 2022, the low interest rate environment and the impact from the sale of the P&C and related realized gain that will put pressure on ROE. But we do see an upward trajectory, given our current business mix, our growth outlook, our diverse set of investment capabilities, the returns that we have been generating on new business in the current environment. And then, lastly, the deployment of some excess capital. I think all of those things get you to migrate up and suggest that based on the current macro outlook for us achieving, probably, the lower end of that range, but nonetheless, in the range.
Ryan Krueger: Got it. Thanks. And then I just had a follow-up on non-medical health, given your comments on favorable dental utilization in the first quarter so far. Would you anticipate setting up an unearned premium reserve again in 2021 or is that more of one-off practice the volatility we saw in 2020?
John McCallion: Yeah. I would just remind you, Ryan, the reason that we were able do that is, because services were not available. Dentists’ offices were closed. We don’t forecast that will be the case in 2021. So we will not expect the need or the requirement to set up an unearned premium reserve for that.
Ryan Krueger: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Nigel Dally: Great. Thanks and good morning. With your free cash flow ratio, given your guidance, I am assuming that you expect a relatively benign credit conditions. Just hoping to get clarification as to whether that’s accurate, are you still looking at opportunistically de-risking your portfolio or is that no longer necessary?
John McCallion: So, Nigel, it’s John. Maybe I will start and if Steve wants to dive in on the credit outlook, I will let him do that. So, just as you said on our free cash flow outlook and just to help reconcile and reiterate some of the things I just -- I said in my opening remarks. We gave a scenario back in Q1 that assumed an extension really of the March 31st macroeconomic conditions. And then Steve articulated in that call, some assumptions around credit losses and downgrades. So what’s different, right? As we said, market conditions have improved. Interest rates are higher. Equity and credit markets are resilient. And as a result, we have seen limited credit losses with the portfolio. And it’s -- but notwithstanding the fact that, environment remains uncertain here. So that’s kind of one. The other thing is, we have gone through as a result of those macro factors and kind of completing our year-end cash flow testing requirements and the final update for our VA principal based reserving in New York, and as a result, we expect our combined NAIC RBC ratio to remain above our target. And again, I’d just say, that’s a real testament to the team’s approach and proactive approach to AUM and hedging. So, therefore, we -- our outlook for our cash flow guidance stays intact. So, maybe, Steve, can give some more on credit outlook.
Steve Goulart: Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Nigel. It’s Steve. I think John set the stage for that too, just thinking back, March 31st was a very different time period than we are in today and we certainly did look at how bad could the downside be. Since then we have seen obviously the Fed is really playing an active role in the markets. We have seen fiscal stimulus and so the markets continue to trundle along. However, what I’d say on all of that is, our watch word continues to be one of caution in these markets. Again, some of the fundamentals are positive. The economic recovery continues -- seems to be continuing, although a lot of it is going to be based on the vaccine rollout now and what happens there. I look at some of the actions we made over the past nine months or so continuing to really manage the portfolio particularly in those sectors that we thought were more exposed in this economic environment and we are very pleased with how we are positioned today. But again, we are cautious and we look at spreads in the market today. Spreads are very tight. It’s not clear that the return we are getting particularly in the public fixed income markets really matches the risk there. So we are cautious. We really continue to favor high quality names in the public markets. And most importantly, we continue to move to private assets in the private markets, which are strengths of ours and really do continue to show relative value and better risk reward trade-offs than we see in a number of the private markets. And that’s where we are continuing to put the majority of our new investment flows.
Nigel Dally: That’s very helpful. Thank you. The results in the back half of 2021, you also mentioned, vaccine distribution as an area of uncertainty. So just wanted to get some clarity as to what you are assuming with the guides of vaccine distribution. Just trying to understand whether that’s potential area of vulnerability or whether you have been a bit cautious with the guides and assumptions that you are building into that?
Michel Khalaf: Yeah. Nigel, you broke up a little bit. But I think the question was around just our -- what are we assuming in terms of vaccine rollout? Is that right?
Nigel Dally: Yeah. Vaccine rollout especially for LatAm.
Michel Khalaf: For LatAm. Okay. Yeah. Maybe I will start and…
John McCallion: Yeah. And we have Eric Clurfain who took over as Head of LatAm effective January 1st with us, so he can provide some more color.
Michel Khalaf: Yeah. And I will just say, as I said broadly speaking, I think, how that rolls out across the US. .and Latin America, TBD. But, so the there still remains quite a bit of uncertainty. Maybe I will turn it over to Eric.
Eric Clurfain: Sure. Thanks, John. So as you might recall, compared to the U.S., Latin America was really roughly on a quarter lag from the onset of the pandemic and this lag continues to hold. Regarding the -- looking ahead, the rollout of the vaccine, we expect delays and especially in Mexico. However, we are very pleased with the fundamentals and the financial strength of our business in the region and that remains strong and our leading franchise in the region remains intact. We expect our revenues to grow also really supported by strong persistency, which we have seen across the region and a good example is our flagship product in Mexico, our Met99 product and this will support growth in 2021. So just to close as you have seen in John’s comments in our outlook, we expect ‘22 earnings to really come back and return to a historical levels by then.
Nigel Dally: That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go to the Group Benefits guidance, particularly the longer term outlook. So after a big lift in PFOs next year due to Versant, I think, you are reverting back to 4% to 6% growth, which is consistent with your outlook for last year -- from last year. I would have thought maybe there could be some upside to that just given the opportunity to cross-sell some of the diverse end product to your existing clients. So is the 4% to 6% conservative or is there an opportunity to maybe the high-end or exceed that based on cross-selling of the Versant product?
Ramy Tadros: Hi, Suneet. It’s Ramy here. So just the headline number, remember here the 4% to 6% comes on top of a double-digit next year. So we are applying a 4% to 6% bigger PFO number. But if you were just to step back and look at that franchise and look at the 2020 results, we are seeing very strong momentum here. Our value proposition is resonating with our customers and intermediaries. And our 2020 results full year had a 5% PFO growth. And I would remind you that includes about a point of headwind from the dental premium discount that we provided in the second quarter. So this is a result we are really pleased with especially in the context of a challenging external environment. But looking forward in terms of our confidence in the outlook, we talked about Versant and we -- the strategic fit is there. We continue to see very good reaction from our customers and intermediaries about Versant and the integration is well underway. We continue to see very strong persistency across our book and rate actions that have been consistent with our expectations. In the jumbo market, which was light in 2020. That activity has returned in 2021 and we are kind of winning our fair share. So we are expecting to see strong sales figures coming into Q1. And then, finally, if you think about our outlook, I would say, what’s coming into sharp focus here is the increasing importance of the investments we have been making and continue to make and our capabilities broadly, and specifically, our digital capabilities to kind of meet the changing needs of our customers and this is where our scaling ability to invest is paying off dividends. So to give you just a sense of that in voluntary PFOs, we saw a 20% growth in our PFOs in 2020 over ‘19 and we are expecting a similar growth in ‘21. Those numbers compound, so our 2020 PFOs involuntary were more than double our 2017 numbers. But this is a big ship to move and hence kind of the guidance is, we think is the right one beyond ‘21.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. I will stop there given the time. Thanks.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I’d now like to turn the call back to John Hall.
John Hall: Great. Thank you very much, everyone, for joining us and have a good day.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-05 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday’s earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife’s SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife’s third quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks, if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features disclosures and GAAP reconciliations, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Before I turn the call over to Michele, I have a quick scheduling note. When we report MetLife full year results in February. We will consolidate our annual outlook call with our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, making for an impactful 60 minute call. Stay tuned. With that, over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and welcome everyone. As you saw in our earnings release last night MetLife delivered strong financial results in the third quarter of 2020. These results are a testament to the kind of company that MetLife has become. We are simpler and more predictable. For example, the impact of our Annual Actuarial Assumption review was modest and consistent with the sensitivities we provided last quarter. We had a well-diversified mix of market leading businesses that diversity was on display and the largely offsetting impacts of COVID-19. And we have an ongoing commitment to consistent execution. A good quarter at MetLife is just another installment in what investors have come to expect of us. And what we expect of ourselves. Turning the numbers, we reported third quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion, or $1.73 per share, compared to $1.27 per share a year ago. Net income of $633 million, was below adjusted earnings, mostly due to losses on derivatives held to protect our balance sheet against movements and equity markets and interest rates. For year-to-date 2020, MetLife has generated $5.1 billion of net income. Excluding all notable items, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion, or $1.95 per share, compared to $1.4 billion or $1.64 per share a year ago. The only notable item in the quarter was our annual actuarial assumption review, which had a negative $203 million impact on adjusted earnings and an incremental negative $98 million impact on net income. This is largely a function of lowering our long-term interest rate assumption from 3.75% to 2.75%. As expected, we experienced a significant recovery in our private equity portfolio, which we'll report on a one quarter lag, the rebound that occurred, a 6.7% return tracked with the mid-single digit forecast we provided in Q2. Other contributors, including hedge funds and prepayments, added meaningfully to our $652 million of pre-tax variable investment income. Turning to some third quarter business highlights, our US business segment produced very strong adjusted earnings, driven by group benefits and retirement and income solutions. In group benefits, group life mortality experience improved from the second quarter and dental utilization and disability remains favorable. RIS benefited from the rebound and VII, as well as temporarily wider recurring investment spreads. Offsetting this property and casualty so heavier than normal catastrophe losses that overwhelmed favorable auto claims frequency. Outside the US, Asians adjusted earnings action levels are up 34% from a year ago on higher VII, favorable underwriting, lower expenses and volume growth. Adjusted earnings next notables in Latin America were down 67% year-over-year, as COVID claims rose sharply as expected. In EMEA, adjusted earnings ex notables increased 26% due to lower expenses, favorable underwriting and volume growth. And finally for MetLife Holdings, adjusted earnings ex notables rose 35% on higher VII and better Long Term Care underwriting results. Our cash position strengthened during the quarter, and being at $7.8 billion well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The increase in cash is mostly due to our issuance of $1 billion of six preferred stock during the quarter, which was used in October to retire $1 billion of floating preferred stock. As we committed in September, we have resumed the purchases of our common stock, roughly, $80 million in the third quarter and about another $240 million since then. Despite the extreme disruption 2020 has presented, we are on track this year to deploy $4.3 billion of capital towards strategic M&A, common stock dividends and share repurchases. We believe this underscores the durability of our all-weather Next Horizon strategy and MetLife's consistent execution across a range of economic scenarios. We rolled our Next Horizon strategy almost one year ago with three main pillars, focus on deploying scarce capital and resources to their highest use, simplify MetLife by driving operational efficiency and improving the customer experience, and differentiate to drive competitive advantage in the marketplace. We believe we have made clear progress on all three fronts. At Investor Day last December, I noted that our capital management philosophy at MetLife has not changed. Capital is precious, and we are disciplined in deploying it to the highest value opportunities. Our purchase of Versant Health, which we expect to close before year-end, demonstrates our commitment to this approach. Vision Care is a capital-light business with strong risk adjusted returns and high free cash flow generation, like our US group benefits franchise more broadly, it is precisely the kind of business we want to grow. Knowing where not to play is just as important as knowing where to place our strategic bets. During the quarter, we booked the sale of our annuity business in Argentina, which was no longer the right fit for MetLife. While not material to MetLife, this divestment helps illustrate our ongoing process of planting and pruning in an effort to achieve the optimal business mix. When we talk about simplifying MetLife, we have two goals in mind, continuously improving our operational efficiency and becoming an easier company for our customers to do business with. On efficiency, given the headwinds we have faced this year, we knew it was going to be a challenge to meet our target of a 12.3% direct expense ratio, but this is a firm commitment, and we will keep it. Despite higher anticipated seasonal expenses in Q4, we are increasingly confident that we will beat this target for the full year. By embracing an efficiency mindset, we are also freeing up resources that can be reinvested in critical areas to improve the customer experience. A case in point is the investment we are making in group disability in the US. The shared goal of all stakeholders in the disability system, whether employees, employers or insurance carriers is to achieve the best possible health outcomes and get people back to their lives and livelihoods as quickly as possible. We are implementing an end-to-end disability and Absence Management solution to meet changing customer expectations and extend our leadership in this space. By investing in the customer experience here and across our businesses, we deepen MetLife's competitive advantage into the future. The third pillar of our strategy is differentiation, those competitive advantages that set us apart from our peers. One of the most important is our talent. A major strength of being a truly global company is that we can redeploy talent to match it against our most promising opportunities. This is precisely what we have done and the latest round of leadership changes that MetLife announced last month. And I want to begin by thanking Oscar Schmidt for his exemplary service to MetLife over the past 26 years. Under his leadership, MetLife has grown to become the largest life insurer in Latin America, with a well-diversified set of leading businesses across the region. When Oscar steps away from his executive position at the end of the year, we will rotate a number of executives into new roles. Eric Clurfain will move from CEO of Japan to Head of Latin America, Dirk Ostijn will move from Head of EMEA to CEO of Japan, and Nuria Garcia will move from Deputy Head of EMEA to running the region. Taken together, these appointments demonstrate not only our commitment to talent development, but are deep bunch of leaders who are ready to step up immediately and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. Another area of differentiation I want to highlight is sustainability, which is core to our purpose at MetLife. The best talent want to work for sustainable companies. Corporate customers want sustainability embedded in their supply chain. And investors are increasingly interested in owning companies that incorporate environmental, social and governance principles into how they operate. To highlight one example at MetLife, in September, we set ambitious new targets for our environmental performance. We committed to reduce our location-based greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, originate $20 billion in new green investments and direct $5 million to develop products and partnerships that will drive climate solutions all by the year 2030. We believe sustainability can be a competitive differentiator for us. At a day long session with our Board of Directors in late September, we pressure tested every aspect of our next horizon strategy. We came away more confident than ever that our strategy will not only continue to guide us through the current environment but position us to emerge from the crisis in even stronger shape. From capital deployment and digital acceleration to expense rigor and a culture of experimentation, we are accelerating the pace of change to win with customers and create shareholder value. Before I close, I would like to say a few words about one of the towering figures in the history of MetLife. John Creedon, MetLife's President and CEO from 1983 to 1989, passed away on October 11 at the age of 96. John's path at MetLife literally took him from the mail room to the board room. Among his many notable achievements was hiring Snoopy and the Peanuts gang, and furthering the company's expansion into global markets. But perhaps what best captures John's career was his passion for the customer. The overarching goal he had in every job was to exceed customer expectations. John's passing reminds us that we are stewards of a great institution. MetLife was around long before we got here, and it will be around long after we are gone. Our task is to create long-term value for MetLife's many stakeholders, including our shareholders, to ensure in the words of our purpose statement that we will be always with you build in a more confident future. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michele. And good morning. I will start with the 3Q 2020 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slide provides more detail on our annual global actuarial assumption review as well as an update on our cash and capital positions. Starting on page three, the schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net income in the third quarter were $633 million, or $945 million lower than adjusted earnings. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from higher long-term interest rates, as well as the stronger equity markets in the quarter. The investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. In addition, the actuarial assumption review accounted for $98 million of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings, which I will now discuss in more detail on page four. During the quarter, the actuarial assumption review reduced net income by $301 million, of which $203 million impacted adjusted earnings. The most significant driver was the reduction of our long-term US 10 year treasury interest rate assumption from 3.75% to 2.75%. In addition to this 100 basis point reduction, we have extended our mean reversion rate to 12 years. These changes reflect expectations of lower interest rates for a longer period of time. The overall impact to earnings is consistent with the sensitivities provided on our second quarter 2020 earnings call. Page five provides a breakdown of the actuarial assumption viewed by business segment. The vast majority of the earnings impact was in MetLife Holdings, primarily due to the change in our long-term US interest rate assumption. We also had a few adjustments in Asia, Latin America and EMEA, primarily due to lower interest rates and various changes in policyholder behavior. On page six, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items in both periods. Both quarters exclude the impact of their respective actuarial assumption reviews. In addition, the prior year quarter had $88 million associated with our completed unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate and Other. Excluding these notable items, adjusted earnings were up 24% and 25% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 27% and 28% on a constant currency basis. Overall, variable investment income was higher than third quarter of 2019 by $257 million after tax. This year-over-year increase in VII accounted for nearly 75% of the total adjusted earnings growth, favorable expense margins and solid volume growth or other key year-over-year drivers. Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group benefits adjusted earnings were up 7% year-over-year. The group life mortality ratio was 89.6%, and which improved sequentially and included roughly three percentage points related to COVID-19 claims. This is at the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. We expect the group life mortality ratio in the fourth quarter to be modestly above the annual target range as fourth quarter tends to have higher seasonal life claims, and we expect COVID-19 related claims will remain elevated. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for group non-medical health was 67.4%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77%, driven by favorable dental and disability results. As the quarter progressed, dental utilization came in above expectations, which was offset by the partial release of the unearned premium reserve we established in the second quarter. We expect this dental utilization trend to continue and would expect the group non-medical health ratio in the fourth quarter to be at the low end of its annual target range of 72% to 77%. In regards to the topline, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% year-over-year due to growth across most products and markets as well as the partial release of the unearned dental premium reserve. Excluding the unearned dental premium reserve release, which totaled approximately $110 million, group benefits PFO growth would have been within the annual target range of 4% to 6%. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 73% year-over-year. The drivers were strong investment margins, primarily higher variable investment income, favorable underwriting margins of roughly $50 million in the quarter, of which we estimate approximately half is related to elevated COVID-19 mortality and volume growth. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 156 basis points, up 54 basis points year-over-year. Spreads, excluding VII, were 98 basis points in the quarter, up 19 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates and an increase in prepayments of RMBS held on our books at a discount. Looking ahead, we expect RIS investment spreads in 4Q to decline sequentially, primarily due to lower VII, but still come in at the top end of the annual guidance range of 90 to 115 basis points. RIS liability exposures grew 12.5% year-over-year driven by strong volume across the product portfolio, as well as separate account investment performance. While liability exposures grew, RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were down 8% year-over-year due to lower structured settlement in institutional income annuity sales. Regarding pension risk transfers, we had approximately $500 million of PRT sales in the quarter and are seeing a good pipeline building once again. Property & Casualty or P&C adjusted earnings were down 68% versus the prior year period, driven by unfavorable underwriting margins due to higher catastrophe losses. The overall combined ratio was 104.2%, which was above our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter of 98.4%. Catastrophe losses were $115 million after-tax in the quarter, $60 million higher than 3Q of 2019. This quarter's cats primarily related to a tropical storm that impacted the Northeast and severe windstorms in the Midwest. It was the highest quarterly cat loss for our P&C business in nearly a decade. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 34% and 32% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income, as well as favorable underwriting and expense margins. In addition, Asia continues to benefit from solid volume growth, driven by higher general account assets under management, which were up 6% on an amortized cost basis. Looking ahead, we expect Asia's strong VII and favorable underwriting in 3Q to return to more normal levels in the fourth quarter. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 67% and 62% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting and lower Chilean and Kahe returns, which were essentially flat in the quarter. Elevated COVID-19 related life claims, primarily in Mexico, impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $70 million after-tax in the quarter. We expect COVID-19 related claims in the fourth quarter to remain elevated. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 26% and 30% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by favorable underwriting margins as a result of lower claims and group policies in the region, as well as better expense margins and volume growth. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 35% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by higher private equity returns, as well as favorable underwriting margins, as lower claim incidents and long-term care more than offset marginally higher life claims due to COVID-19. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 60.2%, which included 7.3 percentage points related to the actuarial assumption review. Adjusting for this impact, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 52.9%, within our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Looking ahead to 4Q, we expect MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings to return to more normal levels due to lower VII and more normal underwriting results in long-term care. Corporate and Other adjusted loss was $131 million. This result was modestly more favorable than the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $135 million, excluding notable items. This quarter's results reflect lower expenses, partially offset by less favorable investment margins, as well as higher preferred stock dividends. As we outlined in our 2Q earnings call, we expect an adjusted loss range of $325 million to $375 million in the second half of 2020, which implies corporate and other adjusted losses to be between to $250 million in 4Q. The Company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20% at the bottom of our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now let's turn to VII in the quarter on page seven. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income over the prior five quarters, including $652 million in the third quarter of 2020. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 6.7% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, and the positive marks included in our third quarter results are in line with the outlook offered in our last earnings call. There was also a positive contribution to VII from hedge funds, which had a 13% return in the quarter, as well as higher prepayment fees. In the fourth quarter, we expect VII to remain strong, but closer to the pre 2Q 2020 trend levels. Now let's take a look at VII by segment on page eight. This table breaks out the third quarter VII of $515 million after-tax by segment. The three largest recipients of VII in the quarter were MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia. The allocation of VII by business segment is based on the quarterly returns of their individual portfolios. That said, as a general rule, MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia will account for approximately 90% of the total VII and roughly split one-third each. Our new money rate was 2.76% versus a roll-off rate of 3.81% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 3.41% and a roll-off rate of 3.72% in 2Q of 2020. The 65 basis point sequential decline in the new money rate was primarily due to tighter credit spreads in the quarter, purchases of short term investments to match short-term issuances in our capital markets business, as well as higher liquidity at the holding company. We also purchased close to $1 billion in low yielding foreign government bonds, primarily JGBs, to invest cash flows associated with recurring premium income from our Japanese yen in-force block. Looking ahead, we expect new money yields in 4Q to remain at comparable 3Q levels as we maintain our disciplined approach to investing in high-quality assets despite persistently tight credit spreads. Turning to page nine. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and the first three quarters of 2020. In 3Q, our direct expense ratio was 11.4%. This low ratio was driven by a reduction in direct expenses, increased availability of our dental services driving higher premium and a reserve release in corporate and other. Year-to-date, our direct expense ratio was 11.9%. We expect the direct expense ratio to be higher than trend in 4Q, primarily due to seasonality. In our Group Benefits business, we incur higher enrollment and other costs prior to receiving premiums. Also, certain corporate initiative costs are expected to be higher in 4Q. Overall, as Mitchell noted, we are increasingly confident that we will beat our full year target of approximately 12.3%. As we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm. I will now discuss our cash and capital on page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $7.8 billion at September 30, which is up from $6.6 billion at June 30 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.2 billion increase in cash at the holding companies was primarily the result of a $1 billion preferred stock issuance in the quarter. The proceeds from this issuance were used in October to redeem $1 billion of preferred stock outstanding. In addition, cash at the holding companies reflect the net effects of subsidiary dividends payments of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $80 million in the quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our US company's preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2020 statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.2 billion, while net income was approximately $2.8 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $200 million from the prior year period, primarily due to higher VA rider reserves and the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. This was partially offset by the favorable underwriting, higher separate account returns and lower operating expenses. Year-to-date, net income was lower due to the decrease in operating earnings and other realized losses. These were partially offset by derivative gains in the current year. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21 billion at September 30, up 12% compared to December 31, 2019. Operating Income and derivative gains more than offset dividends paid. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 892% as of June 30, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife delivered a strong quarter, bolstered by an increase in variable investment income and supported by the solid fundamentals from a diverse set of market leading businesses. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity, and investment portfolio are strong, resilient, and well-positioned to manage through and come out stronger in this challenging environment. Finally, we are confident the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the capital discussion. You guys mentioned you have a good amount of excess capital above the buffer you'd like to hold at the holding company, even if we adjust for the preferred stock that you paid back subsequent to the end of the quarter. So just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about kind of working your way back down to kind of the target buffer. And as we think about the environment normalizing combined with potentially holding on to some excess capital for potential M&A as we hear about some kind of new properties that could potentially see out there in the life space?
Michel Khalaf: Hey. Good morning, Elyse. It's Michel. So let me begin by saying that at a high level, we have a well-diversified mix of market leading businesses and I think that diversity was on display and the largely offsetting impact from COVID-19. In addition, we believe that our capital liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well-positioned to manage through and come out stronger in this challenging environment. And ultimately, I think this, we believe, underscores the durability of our all-weather next Horizon strategy and our consistent execution across a range of economic scenarios. What I would say around sort of our capital management philosophy is that it has not changed. So we believe excess capital above and beyond what's required to fund organic growth belongs to our shareholders and should be used for share repurchases, common dividends or strategic acquisitions that clear a minimum risk-adjusted hurdle rate. As you mentioned, as you referenced, after we complete our buyback authorization by year-end and the Versant acquisition, we expect to have a cash buffer well in excess of our $3 billion to $4 billion target, but no change in terms of our philosophy and how we would deploy excess capital.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, I wanted to get a little bit more color on the group side. The non-medical results have been pretty strong this year. Can you kind of alluded to favorable dental results, and it sounds like that you continue into the fourth quarter at the low-end of your range. How should we think about that business performing into 2021? Do you just have some initial thoughts, obviously, given that the business has been a little kind of volatile this year to see the impact of COVID?
Ramy Tadros: Good morning, Elyse. It's Ramy here. So with respect to the non-medical health ratio, first, you've got the disability part of that business. Historically, you've seen a linkage, although be delayed linkage between recessions and increases in frequency and lower recoveries on the LTD book. We have not seen that yet. The results continue to track pretty favorably on the LTD side. But there is a lag, and we're continuing to monitor this pretty carefully. On the STD side, the COVID impact has been a push for us, as we look forward. So higher coverage related claims have been offset by lower claims due to delays of elective surgeries, et cetera. So we continue to monitor the LTD book into next year. But I would remind you, we can re-price just shy of 50% of that business every year. So our block is about 13% of our PFOs and about half of that can be re-priced every year. So this is a short term business, and we have a track record of being able to appropriately react to changes in the environment and get the rate changes that we need. On the dental side, this year has been an exceptional year in the sense that we've had all the shutdowns and that are COVID related in the second quarter, and hence, the rationale and the reason why you've set up the unearned premium reserves. As we look forward, in terms of the dental business, as John mentioned, as the quarter progressed, dental offices are more fully opened. And we started seeing utilization levels primarily in September that came in above our typical levels, as the patients made up for those services. And this was offset by the partial release of the dental premium that was set up in the second quarter. Sitting here today, we expect to continue to see above typical utilization levels in the fourth quarter for dental. And you will also see us release the balance of the unearned premium reserve in the fourth quarter for the dental business.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate all the color. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Thanks. First question is on MetLife Holdings. Just following the equitable risk transfer deal, a New York company with pretty attractive pricing on that deal. Would you say it makes you more likely to consider risk transfer for that business?
John McCallion: Good morning, Tom. It's John. So let me just start with - I don't think our commentary would change here. So one, as I said before, our focus is on optimizing MetLife Holdings. It's a large and stable well-seasoned in force. It's diversified. It's got a number of natural offsets. It's a good source of sustainable free cash flow. That said, we've continued to take an external perspective in a third-party view of the business. And one, I think it makes us better at managing the business. Two, we need to do this work because it has got some complex - complexity to it. So you need to do the work upfront. And I think it can give us an opportunity to accelerate albeit appropriately, the release of capital and reserves. So I think it was an interesting data point. I think data spreads are still wide. But certainly, as I said before, I think some increases in supply here can narrow that. And I don't think it's changed the sense of urgency we have on how we optimize the business.
Tom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks. And just my follow-up is top line in group benefits, it's holding up pretty well and better than most peers. You see that trend continuing as you think about 2021?
Ramy Tadros: Hey, it's Ramy here. We're clearly pleased with the performance this quarter, and we're exceptionally pleased with the performance, especially in the context of a difficult environment. I mean, think about the rise in unemployment rates, think about we're in the middle of a pandemic as the largest group life insurer in the country and where they're paying claims and fulfilling promises to our customers and beneficiaries.  So just to give you a sense on top line, for the full year, we would expect to be - from a year-over-year perspective, close to the bottom end of our PFO guidance range of 4% to 6% and that's even if you factor in the premium discounts that we've given in Dental. And I would remind you that you should expect to also see top line PFO growth be in double-digits next year with the addition of Versant. So if you're thinking about the top line growth, we still have a pretty robust view of next year.
Tom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Thanks. Good morning. First, I had one follow-up to Tom's question. One piece of MetLife Holdings is participating in Life, which I assume would be a pretty attractive liability to re-insurers. But my question is, because it's participating in from pre-demutualization, is there any impediment to you looking for risk transfer for that specific block?
John McCallion: Hey, Ryan. It's John. I would just say to start that - I would say nothing is necessarily off the table, but there is a closed block, and then there's an open block that have participating policies associated with it. And I think, certainly, the closed block has different complexity associated with it. Both are very well-performing blocks of business. And as I said before, we have a number of businesses that are actually complementary, have a number of natural offsets, which - some of which you actually saw come through this quarter. But yes, I think just to answer your question directly, certain blocks would have different complexities than others.
Ryan Krueger: Got it. Thanks. And then on retirement spread, they did pick up quite a bit on an underlying basis ex VII in the quarter. And I heard your comment on the full year, but as we look a little bit longer into 2021, can you give us any sense of kind of the rough range to think about here?
Michel Khalaf: So you may have heard John's opening remarks. We'll give - we're going to have an outlook call in February, and we'll give more color there. But look, I would just give maybe some qualitative commentary to start. One is, we've seen this - we've seen some resiliency here in our spreads. And it goes back to just a diverse set of businesses we have, not just in terms of source of earnings, but even across spread businesses. We have diverse set of spread businesses, some of which do well in a lower rate, steeper curve environment. And then we have longer tail legacy blocks that obviously would have some spread pressure over a long period of time. And so all things considered, I think we've seen a pretty resilient spread levels this year. Nonetheless, I think over time, there would be longer-term pressure on some of those other long-term blocks, but that ignores new business.
Ryan Krueger: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Nigel Dally: Great. Thanks and good morning. So we're optimizing your businesses. Can you discuss the importance of the property Casualty business the article back in September highlighting potentially the division could be put up to sale. Now you probably don't want to speak to that specific article, but hoping you can discuss just where it fits strategically into our overall mix?
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Hi, Nigel, sure. So first of all, I would say this is a well-run, good business, our P&C business. It's been consistently profitable. It generates mid-teen ROEs. And it does have an important strategic connection to our Group business. It also produces a steady source of non-correlated free cash flow. So I think those are the comments that I would make about the business. And as you said, we're not going to speculate or we're not going to respond to any potential rumors here.
Nigel Dally: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Eric Bass: Hi. Thank you. Just going back to RIS, volumes have also been pretty strong year-to-date despite a lower level PRT activities, so just can you talk about what's been driving this and how you see the outlook for liability growth?
Ramy Tadros: Hey, Eric. It's Ramy here. So as we've talked about, there are a number of different parts or businesses within RIS, we have seen a significant pickup in sales and stable value deposits this year. A lot of that was driven by individuals seeking the safety, that stable value offers them inside their DC plans. Offsetting that, if you think about the other parts of RIS, we've seen more pressure in the structured settlements business, the institutional annuity business. And a lot of those businesses are rate sensitive. So the value proposition to the customer, if you will, is diminished and lower rate environment. And so think about the volumes there, as being - continuing to be driven by the rate environment. PRT, we're seeing it starting to pick up. As John mentioned, we're looking at a pretty healthy pipeline in Q4. But as we've talked about before, we're not chasing top line here. We continue to be highly disciplined, in terms of our pricing of every single deal that we look at, in the PRT space. And then finally, as you probably have seen, we are now well into our entry into the UK longevity market. So far this year, we're close to $1 billion in sales, in terms of longevity swaps. And we continue to see a robust pipeline there, into Q4 into next year. I would just come back and reiterate for RIS. We've seen a very healthy top line. We've seen very healthy growth in liability balances. But discipline is the name of the game here, in terms of looking for the returns, as opposed to chasing growth.
Erik Bass: Thank you. And then maybe, if I could ask one for Steve Goulart, just hoping you could discuss your outlook for the commercial real estate sector? And how you see the current stresses affecting both, your commercial mortgage loan portfolio as well as CMBS more broadly?
Steven Goulart: Sure. Thanks, Erik. I think we've talked about this on a couple of prior calls. Obviously, it's an important topic. It's an important investment for us, in commercial mortgage loans. We continue to be optimistic, about the sector. We like it. We continue to invest in the sector. I think back actually to some of the comments I made, I think it was actually in perhaps a response to one of your questions. But we did see deferral requests, as we entered into the COVID pandemic. I think I mentioned on our last earnings call that those got to about 9%, of our principal balance outstanding, but that appears to be sort of where we topped out. And what's most important now is, as those are rolling off the deferral cost, we've seen 60% of them roll off. And they've all gone back to resuming payment. So I think that supports our underlying view of strength in this sector, Eric. And it continues to be important for us.
Erik Bass: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. I wanted to ask about Asia sales. They're down year-over-year, but up pretty sharply, on a sequential quarter basis. Just curious, what's going on there? We had heard from another company, that there was a pull forward of sales because of some rate changes that helped their sales growth. Just wondering, if there was any kind of similar dynamic at met? Or more specifically what you're seeing, in terms of driving that growth?
Kishore Ponnavolu: Suneet, this is Kishore. Let me say that the premise of your question is correct in the first part, so let me - based on your question, let me start by putting a little bit of context to our sales performance in Q2. In the second quarter, lockdowns and social distancing restrictions had a significant impact on our sales. And Q2 sales for Asia overall dropped 44%, 55% in Japan compared to prior year. To overcome this challenge, we took several distribution and product actions. As you're well aware of all the past investments, we've been making in sales platforms. And on top of that, we implemented several digital solutions to augment our face-to-face interactions. And we also stepped up our sales management activities as well. And because of these actions, we've seen a very strong recovery in Q3 sales, as you rightly pointed out. Q3 sales increased sequentially, 63% for overall Asia, 85% in Japan. And our year-over-year drop is now reduced to 16%. So you asked about the re-pricing that was we did re-price our level premium FX product. It was contributing, but not a major factor in driving our sequential growth. So another way to look at this is to how we're seeing, how this is going to play out for the rest of the year. We expect the impact of our actions that we've taken so far to sustain our Q3 momentum. While the environment is still challenging for face-to-face sales environment, we're seeing a pickup in our sales pipeline, and you should expect a positive year-on-year growth for Asia as a whole.
Suneet Kamath: Got it. Thanks for that. And then I guess - yes. No, it does. Another quick one for John on the VA block. Just curious, as you've mentioned something about reserves on a statutory basis, but is this block sort of past the peak reserve funding period? Or are you still sort of building reserves as the block matures? And at what point do you think you'd be at sort of peak reserves? Thanks.
John McCallion: Good morning, Suneet. Just as a reminder, we have roughly $50 billion of VA account balances. Half of it is a living benefit guarantee. As we showed you back at Investor Day, and that has been rolling off consistently over time. Having said that, there are certain components of that block that are building reserves and others that are, I'd say, kind of have - kind of settled down in terms of the reserve build. So it depends on which vintage you're talking about.
Suneet Kamath: Is there any way to give us a percentage of the block at that peak reserves versus the block that's still building?
John McCallion: I probably have to get back to you on that. I don't have it handy.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks.
John McCallion: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. I had a couple of questions. First, on your Latin America business, sales were down a decent amount year-over-year. I'm assuming that's mostly because of COVID. And to the extent it is, can you give us any color on whether things got better as the quarter went on? And how do you see things working out through the next quarter or two? And then I have another one.
Oscar Schmidt: Yes. Hi, Jimmy. This is Oscar. So let me talk about the quality of our top line overall. So as you said, sales are down because of social distancing because of COVID that affects the entire region. But if you think about it, the sales that we're performing are all done remotely is really good performance considering the potential after social distancing goes away. But if you think about our premiums and fees, and you exclude PF. And let me say that PF in Chile, sales are really down because most of Chileans are deferring their decision to retire. So PF sales are really down. If you exclude PF impacts in our premiums and fees, year-over-year, we are growing above mid-single digits, which is pretty healthy considering the COVID environment. And that speaks about the quality of our persistency, not just the resilient sale [ph]. So we are very confident about our topline health, particularly if you strip out the PES, which, as I said are, obviously, related to a few number of silencing to retire. So we're very confident as well that as our agents are for core channels, they learn to remotely as they can start dealing face-to-face with these customers, sales are going to go back to normal and it's happening. So we're very happy about the potential.
Jimmy Bhullar: And then maybe a bigger picture question. You've done a few sort of niche acquisitions in Group benefits. But - and obviously, you're deploying capital towards buybacks as well. Given your - where your stock price is, can you comment on your interest in sort of larger acquisitions and how you think about those because there are - there is a decent amount of activity in the business lines that you're in. Are you interested in large acquisitions as well? Or not as much given sort of the potential accretion from buybacks at this price?
Oscar Schmidt: Hi, Jimmy. Look, I mean, I go back to our strategy and what we shared with you at Investor Day last December. If I look at our portfolio, especially factoring in some of the recent acquisitions, Versant Health, that in [Indiscernible] PetFirst and Digital Willing [ph] I don't - we don't see gaps in terms of the portfolio that - of businesses that we have. We see plenty of organic growth opportunities. And we're focused on getting the synergies and whether cost or revenue synergies from those acquisitions that I referenced. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of sort of insight into our thinking here.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Lee: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. My first question is, when looking at the annual assumption review, should we think about where there's going to be some ongoing run rate earnings impact into some of your segments?
John McCallion: Good morning, Humphrey. Its John. No, we don't expect any material changes in ongoing run rate earnings as a result of the assumption review.
Humphrey Lee: Got it. My second question is, I think, in Michel's prepared remarks, you talked about entering into absence management business. How should we think about the corresponding expense impact from the investment into the business? Especially since some of your peers have incurred quite a meaningful labor expenses for this business as they ramp up?
Ramy Tadros: Hi, Humphrey. Its Ramy here. So in terms of our actual expenses relating to our disability business this quarter, we're running right on line with expectations. So, we're not really seeing any impact here whatsoever. What Michel was talking about is some of our broader investments in technology and platform around disability and absence management. All of those numbers on all of those investments have been baked into our run rate that you've seen over the past many quarters. And our investments here are in areas like pricing sophistication, contract competitiveness, clinical model in terms of the return to health initiatives, which are critical for the LTD business. And we've already seen positive business outcomes and end-to-end disability and absence management solution, which Michel is talking about is already resonating in the market with the larger employers. It includes things like the digital interface for claimants, AI-driven automated claim processing, sophisticated data analytics for employers so that they can understand their workforce. And we're expecting to see growth here, although growth with discipline in this area going forward.
John McCallion: And Humphrey, it's John. I would just add just to Ramy's point there. In a little bit the way you asked the question, this is all part of the - as we refer to as the efficiency mindset concept, where we continue to drive efficiencies every quarter in the firm and look for opportunities then to redeploy that into strategic reinvestments to support our market leading businesses and doing all of that within our run rate costs. So I would just go back to that point. We made that point at Investor Day, and I think it's a key component for us as we move forward.
Humphrey Lee: Got it. Appreciate the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
John Barnidge: Thank you. Another licensure that reported last night talked about elevated non-COVID mortality from delaying care, heart attacks and deaths of despair in their book. As it relates to the Group Life business and benefits, are you seeing signs of this?
Ramy Tadros: No, we're not.
John Barnidge: Okay. And then, are you seeing any signs of permanent change of behavior coming out of COVID that may impact claims utilization trends on a more secular basis? Thank you for the answers.
Ramy Tadros: Not yet.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd now like to turn the call back to Michel Khalaf.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you. In closing, I believe our performance in Q3 and so far in 2020, underscores the sense of urgency and laser focus and how this leadership team is executing on our Next Horizon strategy to create long-term shareholder value. I am thankful and proud of the effort and commitment of our employees around the world, who are going above and beyond to deliver for our customers. Please be safe and talk soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. We hope you and your families are both safe and healthy. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set a supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features disclosures and GAAP reconciliations, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Now over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone. My focus this morning will be on how MetLife is successfully managing through the current crisis, financially, operationally and culturally. I'll begin with our financial performance in the second quarter, which demonstrates 3 key fundamentals about our business. First, we have become a simpler and more predictable company. On our last earnings call, we set the major pandemic related impact in the second quarter would be the loss in our private equity portfolio. The negative 8.2% return we reported fell squarely within the range provided. Second, our businesses are well diversified by both geography and product, providing meaningful offsets to increased claims from COVID-19. In aggregate, the second quarter was not an underwriting event.  And third, we remain a company that is committed to and generate strong free cash flow, providing us with significant liquidity and flexibility. In the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $758 million or $0.83 per share compared to $1.38 per share a year ago. Net income of $68 million fell below adjusted earnings primarily due to losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet against declining equity markets. On a 2020 year-to-date basis, MetLife has generated $4.4 billion of net income. As you know, our private equity portfolio is reported on a one quarter lag, so the results reflect the extremely difficult first quarter equity market. The percentage decline in our private equity portfolio was much smaller than the 20% drop in the S&P 500, but still generated an after-tax quarterly loss of $0.48 per share, consistent with the expectations we shared with you. Given the substantial rebound in the equity market, we expect a significant recovery in our private equity portfolio when we next report our quarterly results. Our roughly $500 billion investment portfolio remains a key strength for MetLife.  We believe the diversity, quality and liquidity of our portfolio as well as our early actions to reduce risk position us well for a variety of market outcomes. Year-to-date, we have seen only modest realized investment losses. Our underwriting results in the quarter reflect the broad diversity of our businesses. For example, higher claims frequencies in the U.S. were largely balanced by fewer auto insurance claims of selling longevity impact and lower claims and utilization of other protection products globally. Our group benefits business is instructive. Higher mortality drove our group life benefit ratio beyond our annual target range, but this was offset in part by a decrease in dental utilization. Looking ahead, we expect group life mortality to improve but remain elevated in the third quarter. And while dental utilization should increase as we move through the year, with deferred recognition of dental premium given the significant decrease in the availability of dental services. This has the effect of limiting outsized results in any one quarter. Overall, we continue to expect that the diversity of our business mix will mitigate the global underwriting impact of COVID-19.  Turning to free cash flow. We have long spoken of a life insurers capacity to generate cash as one of the most critical measures of the strength and sustainability of its business model. In the second quarter, we were able to grow total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $6.6 billion. This is up from $5.3 billion sequentially and well above our cash buffer target of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our strong cash reserves provide us with significant financial flexibility to navigate an uncertain and changing economic landscape, including taking advantage of opportunities as well as managing potential impacts to our investment portfolio. Beyond our financial results, I would like to spend a few minutes on other ways we are managing the challenges presented by the pandemic. Operationally, our people continue to show grit and determination and not only stepping up to respond effectively to a challenging environment, but in accelerating some of the trends that will be critical to our long-term success. Enterprise-wide, 75% of our employees continue to work remotely. Throughout the crisis, we have been able to deliver for our customers without interruption. In our U.S. group business, for example, we continue to meet or exceed our service level agreements. The crisis is also causing us to fast forward the digitization of our company, which will produce lasting benefits.  Turning to the U.S. Group business again. We have expedited and now completed the rollout of an enhanced digital platform that makes it easier for customers to get benefit information, make payments and for a claim. Since the start of the year, the number of people eligible to access the platform has grown by more than 30 million. In addition to continuing to invest to improve the customer experience, we also provided our customers with significant premium relief in the second quarter. While this created some top line pressure, we remain committed to strong expense discipline. We moved quickly to find savings as part of our efficiency mindset and are still on track to achieve our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.3%. For the first 6 months of the year, the ratio is 12.2%. An essential part of being a high-performing company is having a strong culture and here, too, we are seeing improvements. One of the biggest concerns about the shift to working from home was that employee engagement would suffer.  We have been experiencing the opposite effect. In all 3 of our priority areas, collaboration across the enterprise, a strong focus on the customer and a spirit of experimentation, employee engagement has actually strengthened. Part of this is the deep sense of purpose that our employees feel at a time when what we do matters more than ever. Another factor is our commitment as a leadership team to communicating at unprecedented levels. For example, we have been holding interactive global town halls for all of our employees every other week. Our commitment to building momentum for our next Horizon strategy has a new urgency as well. More than 25,000 employees have participated in immersive virtual sessions to build a strong sense of ownership. The pillars of our strategy remain more relevant than ever, focus on deploying scarce capital to its highest use, simplify MetLife by driving operational efficiency and improving the customer experience and differentiate to drive competitive advantage in the marketplace.  Far from slowing us down, the current crisis is accelerating our efforts to find attractive opportunities. In June, we closed our first ever deal in the U.K. longevity reinsurance market. Longevity risk is a business that allows us to tap several competitive advantages, including our world-class actuarial talent. In addition, the underwriting and capital dynamics of this business fit well with our internal rate of return and payback period requirements. Another growth opportunity is the need of products we are adding to our market-leading employee benefits platform. In January, we closed on the acquisition of PetFirst to give us access to the fast-growing pet insurance market. Even though we will not launch the product on our platform until later this year, 25 large employers with approximately 250,000 eligible employees have already signed up to offer pet insurance as a voluntary benefit. Before I close, I would like to say a word about MetLife's commitment to diversity and inclusion, a topic that has taken on greater importance in light of recent protests across the United States. MetLife has taken a number of steps to contribute to a more just and equitable society. We have spoken out in the face of injustice.  We have committed to improving diversity within our own workforce, and we have contributed financially to organizations that advance rational equity. While we know there is more work to do, both as a company and as a society, our purpose is motivating us to help make forward progress. What I hope you will take away from today's call is that MetLife feels a tremendous sense of urgency about the future. Everyone has heard the expression, don't let a crisis go to waste. At MetLife, we are taking that to heart and doing the work now to position ourselves for long-term success. We're becoming more efficient. We're gaining new customer insights. We're strengthening our culture and we're remaining laser-focused on consistent execution. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to discuss our second quarter results in greater detail.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll start with the 2Q '20 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slide provides more detail on our outlook for the third quarter as well as an update on our cash and capital positions.  Starting on Page 3. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $68 million, were $690 million lower than adjusted earnings of $758 million. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from the stronger equity markets as well as higher long-term interest rates in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $4.4 billion compared to net income of $3 billion in the first half of 2019. The investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. Also, as highlighted on Page 3, adjusted earnings included a $438 million after-tax loss in Variable Investment Income, or VII. I will provide more details on this shortly. On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding total notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $70 million associated with our recently completed unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in corporate and other. Excluding the UCI cost in the second quarter of '19, adjusted earnings were down 45% and down 44% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were down 43% and down 41% on a constant currency basis. Overall, Variable Investment Income was lower than second quarter of '19 by $702 million after tax. This decline in VII was more than the decline in total adjusted earnings year-over-year. Positive year-over-year drivers included solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and equity market strength in the quarter. This was partially offset by the lower recurring interest margins and less favorable taxes compared to 2Q of '19.  Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group benefits adjusted earnings were down 20% year-over-year. The Group Life mortality ratio was 95.9% due to elevated claims related to COVID-19. This is above our annual target range of 85% to 90% and less favorable to the prior year quarter of 85.3%. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for group nonmedical health was 58.5%, which is well below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter ratio of 75.4%. The primary driver was extremely low dental utilization, which I will discuss in more details shortly. In regards to the top line, Group benefits adjusted PFOs were down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower dental premiums from the deferral of revenues given a significant decrease in the availability of dental services and to account for a 25% premium credit to all fully insured customers, excluding these dental premium adjustments, which totaled approximately $500 million in the quarter. Group benefits PFOs would have been within its annual target range due to solid growth across all markets.  Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 45% year-over-year due to unfavorable investment margins related to the decline in variable investment income, which was partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 25 basis points, down 94 basis points year-over-year. Spreads, excluding VII, were 85 basis points in the quarter, up 1 basis point year-over-year due to a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 11% year-over-year, driven by strong volume across all products and separate account investment performance in the quarter. While liability exposures grew RIS adjusted PFOS, excluding pension risk transfers, were down 22% year-over-year due to lower structured settlement and institutional income booty sales. Property and Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 19% versus the prior year period, driven by favorable underwriting margins, partially offset by unfavorable investment margins related to variable investment income. The overall combined ratio was 91.1%, which was more favorable than our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter ratio of 96.1%. P&C results benefited from lower auto claim frequencies due to a decline in miles driven in the quarter. This was partially offset by higher catastrophe losses of $89 million after-tax compared to $62 million after tax in 2Q of '19.  Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 29% and 27% on a constant currency basis due to lower investment margins resulting primarily from the decline in variable investment income in the quarter. This was partially offset by solid volume growth, which was driven by a 5% increase in general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis as well as favorable expense margins. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 17% as foreign exchange rates across the region dampened year-over-year results. If today's FX rates hold, we would expect the year-over-year impact to Latin America's third quarter earnings to be similar to the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings were up 3%, driven by higher equity markets, favorably impacting our Chilean and Kahe returns, which were up 14% in the quarter as well as favorable underwriting margins. This was partially offset by unfavorable investment margins. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 51% and 59% on a constant currency basis. This was a record adjusted earnings quarter for EMEA, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins as a result of lower claims in group Medical and accident and health policies in the region as well as better expense margins. We would expect EMEA's underwriting results to be closer to historical levels in the third quarter. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down $279 million year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income of $250 million after-tax, compared to the prior year. As well as lower recurring interest margins and unfavorable underwriting due to COVID-19 related claims. The Life Interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.1% and which was above the prior year quarter of 53.9% and above our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Higher equity markets in the quarter were a partial offset to the year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings. The separate account return in the quarter was 14.8%, which resulted in a positive $13 million initial impact, which compares to a positive $5 million initial impact in 2Q '19. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $289 million. This result was less favorable to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $237 million, excluding $70 million of UCI costs. The decline in variable investment income was the quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect corporate and other losses to be between $325 in the second half of the year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 19.2%, modestly below our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%.  Now let's turn to Page 5. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the prior 5 quarters, including a loss of $555 million in the second quarter of 2020. The loss was entirely attributable to the private equity portfolio which had a negative 8.2% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, and the negative marks included in our 2Q '20 financial results are in line with our disclosures from the last earnings call.  With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.41% versus a roll-off rate of 3.72% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.01% and a roll-off rate of 4.34% in 2Q '19. We have added a table on Page 6 that breaks out the second quarter negative VII of $438 million after-tax by segment. The largest VII impacts to adjusted earnings in the quarter were MetLife Holdings and Retirement and Income Solutions, followed by Asia and corporate and other.  In the quarter, certain timing adjustments have shifted the relative VII impact between Asia and corporate and other. Going forward, these timing adjustments will be eliminated and as such, we would expect Asia's adjusted earnings to have a larger contribution from VII and corporate and other to have less as compared to the second quarter.  Now let's turn to Page 7. This chart provides one approach to illustrate the impact of below trend VII on our reported earnings. The box in red reflects the adjusted EPS impact of $0.48 related to the negative VII experienced in the quarter. This was the first quarterly loss for VII since 2009. The $0.22 highlighted in the green box illustrates the adjusted EPS impact assuming VII at the quarterly midpoint of our 2020 annual target range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. To be clear, this chart should not be viewed as quarterly guidance, but rather as one approach to illustrate the below trend results.  Moving to Page 8. This walk provides more detail on the group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio. As I noted earlier, the reported ratio of 58.5% was very favorable, driven by low dental utilization. However, 2 adjustments are needed for comparability to our annual target guidance of 72% to 77% and the sensitivities we provided on our outlook call last December. First, the ratio should be adjusted by 3.9 points for the 20th earlier. Second, the ratio should also be adjusted by 7.1 points related to the establishment of an unearned premium reserve. We established an unearned premium reserve recognition with the availability of dental service sources. As dental offices have begun to open across the U.S., we have seen utilization pick up in July for more involved treatments and procedures, which represent less than 20% of our typical overall dental claims. However, incidence remains low for more routine visits. We expect dental utilization to pick up in the second half of the year, pushing the ratio closer to the low end of our 72% to 77% target range.  Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and the first two quarters of 2020. In 2020, our year-to-date direct expense ratio was 12.2%, while the ratio was elevated in 2Q at 12.4% due to top line pressure from premium credits in our dental and auto businesses, as well as the establishment of a dental premium reserve. We remain on track and committed to achieving our full year target of approximately 12.3% as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset to increase capacity for needs of the firm. Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the third quarter, given the continued uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10.  Starting with investments. We expect a strong recovery in variable investment income in the third quarter with our best estimate for private equity returns to be a positive mid-single digit, which is based on a $7.2 billion PE balance at June 30. Regarding recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure from lower rates. However, reinvestment rates have held up reasonably well during the first half of the year, given our diverse market-leading asset origination capabilities. Finally, we expect the short end of the yield curve to remain favorable, supporting investment spreads. Moving on to underwriting margins. We continue to anticipate modest underwriting impacts from COVID-19 on a combined basis. Assuming deaths rise in the U.S. to approximately 200,000 through the third quarter. We expect life insurance claims frequency in the U.S. to moderate. With life insurance benefit ratios and group benefits and MetLife Holdings moving closer to their respective annual target ranges. However, we do expect claims activity to significantly increase in Latin America in the third quarter, as the region is behind other parts of the world in COVID-19 emergence. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks, most notably in Retirement and Income Solutions. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis for 3Q.  Turning to top line metrics, we would expect global face-to-face sales to remain challenged, negatively impacting most of our segments. However, we do anticipate modest sequential sales improvement in Japan. We expect lower adjusted PFOs in most segments with the exception of group benefits, which we expect to have mid- single-digit growth year-over-year. While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, our efficiency mindset is a core tenet of our strategy to manage margin pressures across our business. As I noted earlier, we remain on track to meet our direct expense ratio full year target of approximately 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment.  Now let's turn to Page 11. Given the persistent low interest rate environment, we decided to add this page on estimated impacts to our income statement and balance sheet. If we were to lower our long-term actuarial U.S. interest rate assumption of 3.75% by 25, 50, 100 or 150 basis points. For each hypothetical scenario, GAAP loss recognition is not triggered, and there would be a relatively modest impact to net income, specifically, with respect to the 150 basis point down scenario, which would bring our long-term mean reversion rate assumption to 2.25%. I would highlight 2 points. First, the approximate $425 million net income impact is consistent with the guidance range disclosed on our 1Q '20 earnings call. And second, we will continue to have a significant margin for purposes of GAAP loss recognition. Overall, I believe these sensitivities of test a MetLife significantly reduced risk profile. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 12. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.6 billion at June 30, which is up from $5.3 billion at March 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.3 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends payment of our common stock dividend as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows.  Next, I would like to provide you an update on our capital position. As a reminder, for our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2020 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.8 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $600 million from the first half of 2019, primarily due to higher VA rider reserves and the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. This was partially offset by lower operating expenses. Year-to-date net income was driven by derivative gains, partially offset by lower operating earnings. Our expected total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.1 billion as of June 30, up 13% compared to December 31, 2019. Derivative gains and operating income more than offset dividends paid and other investment losses.  Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 799% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. In summary, this quarter's adjusted earnings were dampened by the negative private equity returns which are based on a one quarter accounting lag. However, the underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses were evident in our results despite the challenging environment. Looking ahead, we expect our third quarter adjusted earnings to benefit from a strong recovery in private equity returns, while continuing to absorb modest underwriting impacts from COVID-19. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well positioned to manage through this unprecedented environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous.
Erik Bass: First question, with $6.6 billion of holding company liquidity and credit impact, [Technical Difficulty] this is -- and is that something that's potentially on the table for the third quarter? Or do you want to wait longer to see how the environment evolves?
Michel Khalaf: Erek, we lost you there in the middle do you mind repeating the question?
Erik Bass: Certainly. It was -- in May on the outlook for capital return. And with the $6.6 billion of HoldCo liquidity and credit impacts trending a bit below fear so far? Just how are you thinking about the timing of resuming share repurchases? And is that something that's potentially on the table for 3Q?
Michel Khalaf: Sure. So as you know, last quarter, we put our share repurchase program on pause. And we felt that was prudent to build our cash and capital and to maintain -- in order to maintain financial flexibility. Our view is that there remains substantial uncertainty in the economy as well as with the pandemic, which is going to take more time to clear. Yet having said that, over the past 3 months, we've seen a resilient equity market and tighter credit spreads, as you reference, government and Fed reserve policy. And our cash position has grown to $6.6 million, which gives us greater financial flexibility and optionality. So if you take all of these factors together, we would not roll out capital management in the latter part of 20 but we remain on plus for the time being. So I hope that answers your question.
Erik Bass: Yes. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up for John on Group. I just wanted to clarify kind of is the idea of the unearned premium reserve to essentially better align the timing of revenues and expenses. So should we think of this as essentially taking some excess earnings from the second quarter and allocating them to future periods when you expect claims and incidents to be higher?
John McCallion: Erik, yes, it's very much about the availability of service. And so in the second quarter, dental offices were closed for quite a bit of time. Remind, part of that, we gave back a 25% premium credit to fully insured customers. And then as you said, we also then said we needed to defer some revenue so that it would be recognized when those services are available. And so those are -- that is a timing item.
Erik Bass: Got it. So it's essentially the earnings -- if you hadn't booked that, would have been higher in the second quarter, but you'll recoup that at some point in the future?
John McCallion: That's correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore.
Thomas Gallagher: The reduction that you gave on free cash flow guide for 2021 last quarter, I think a piece of that was driven by elevated credit loss assumptions. My question is, if interest rates stay low, but credit remains fairly benign, where do you think that would land you in terms of the free cash flow conversion heading into 2021?
John McCallion: Tom, I would just remind you, that was a scenario, not a guide. It was -- there's a lot of different factors. We had a 1- to 2-year assumption of how this may play out. It was based on macro factors as of March 31 when spreads were wide, our equity markets were worse, we'll say interest rates are modestly down. If you look at the 10 years since then. So things, as Michel said, there has been a somewhat resilient equity and credit market for the last 3 months. I'd still say we're in the mode of caution at this point in terms of what the outlook it will be and how this will play out. I also talked about last time that, that factors in some level of cash flow testing. It's a range of outcomes. And that some -- the estimates we provided were based on New York special consideration letter that we receive every year. The last one we got was a year ago, it was based on a certain macroeconomic environment. We'll work through hopefully constructively with them this time. But we wanted to just give a I'll say, a stress set of scenarios for what's a possible outcome. But it's -- I wouldn't call it a guide. I'd just say that's -- those are kind of possible outcomes-based on where but it depends on where macro factors are at the end of the year.
Thomas Gallagher: Got you. And then my follow-up is, any update on MetLife Holdings and the potential for risk transfer or interest rates than the current level of interest rates too low, making the bid as spread too wide? Or do you think something could still happen there even if rates remain kind of where they are?
Michel Khalaf: Yes, I think we're in the same mode that we've been in for the last few quarters. We are preparing for the opportunity for something to occur, although macro factors are creating a wider bid-ask spread, having said that, there's still kind of a biased push to supply being greater. And so that could narrow the bid-ask over time. So I'd say we continue to maintain readiness, but interest rates, I would say, do present a headwind.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW.
Ryan Krueger: On the holding company cash, were there any meaningful timing considerations that influenced the increase in the quarter? Or would you expect a further build in the cash position in the second half of the year, depending on your uses of free cash flow?
John McCallion: Ryan, yes, we did have some lower outflows in the second quarter. And we did receive some proceeds from the sale of Hong Kong. So it was another item, which we did not disclose, as you know. And so on the -- looking at the remainder of the year, I would say, I would not expect the same rate of increase that you're seeing here.
Ryan Krueger: Got it. And then could you provide some updates on what you're seeing in the commercial mortgage loan portfolio in terms of things like forbearance requests and grants and any other statistics that you could provide on what's going on there?
Steven Goulart: Sure, Ryan, it's Steve Goulart. I'll take that. Let's step back and start with an overview of the portfolio again. It's nearly $51 billion now in commercial mortgages. And again, we continue to believe it's very conservatively positioned. The average loan-to-value is 57%. And the average debt service coverage ratio on the portfolio is 2.4x. It's very well diversified geographically and by property type. And we also feel it's concentrated in high-quality assets that are typically located in larger primary markets. So again, backdrop of a very strong fundamentally built diversified portfolio. That said, there clearly are signs of stress in sectors like hotel and retail. For us, that's less than 25% of the total. And not surprisingly, as I talked about on the previous earnings call, we have received requests for temporary debt service payment deferrals on the portfolio. We've reached a point where we're really not seeing much in the way of new requests, but we've granted about 9% on a principal balance outstanding of those. And again, they're heavily concentrated in hotel and retail. But again, these are payment deferrals. We don't expect losses, and we're not projecting losses from any of those today. It's just they're going to be delayed in receiving the principal and interest. And in addition to just those that we've granted deferrals on, we actually have received 100% of all other expected payments. In June. So this is something we'll deal with in this crisis. But again, given our long-term history of performance in commercial mortgages, and I'll remind you, from 2009 to '19, we have less than $120 million in cumulative losses, the portfolio, we believe, is well positioned, and we'll manage through this time period.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question is on the expense side of things. You guys obviously seen a 12.3% for the full year. And Michel, I know since you took over your role, you've kind of put out the message that expense management is a core part of what's going on at met even beyond this year. So as we've been in this COVID environment, and we've heard companies talk about becoming more efficient. Have you guys learned anything or see anything within your expense base that perhaps could lead to more sustainable savings beyond 2020 into 2021 and beyond?
Michel Khalaf: Yes, Elyse. So as you mentioned, we do believe that driving an efficiency mindset. And then just keep in mind, coming off our UCI initiative, where we've exceeded our target is very important, and the management team here is highly committed to this. And if anything, we're seeing an acceleration of this during the pandemic. If you consider that we do have some incremental costs related to the pandemic that we are managing to offset. If you take into account the fact that this quarter, we have about $500 million. Our top line is suppressed by about $500 million due to the dental credits and the UPR that we discussed earlier. We're seeing also some top line pressure just from the pandemic in general, yet we continue to be committed to our 12.3% expense ratio. I think that gives you a sense of just the urgency and the momentum that we're seeing in terms of the adoption of this efficiency mindset. And clearly, as we see further adoption of some of our digital tools, we think those trends are going to persist even coming out of this crisis as we continue to find ways of further simplifying the company. We feel good about sort of what we discussed during Investor Day about our ability to create additional capacity. That's also going to help us continue to invest in growth and innovation. So again, I cannot stress enough. In times of crisis, it's about the things that you control. And that's one area that we feel we do control. And as I said, we're very committed to maintain the 12.3% despite all the other things that I mentioned earlier.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question on the investment spreads within RIS were compressed in the quarter, but that was really due to VII because away from that, they actually held up pretty well. Given your outlook, can you give us a sense of where spreads within RIS for the rest of the year, I guess, could come in relative to your 2020 guide.
Michel Khalaf: Elise, yes. So Q2 spreads were certainly on an overall basis, depressed, driven by the negative returns on our private equity portfolio. And as just as a reminder, we have said that res typically takes about call it, 1/3 of the results from VII. And then excluding spreads, were 85 basis points, up slightly from Q1. And most of that is driven by the drop in LIBOR. This has helped us a little -- be resilient when it comes to our spreads, the shape of the curve against some headwinds. Lower rates do hurt ultimately, but the shape of the curve matters a lot, as we've said before. We also have seen some head, in particular around hotels. So -- but nonetheless, I think the spreads have been resilient. We expect them to VII, where the shape of the curve would help offset some of those other headwinds.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.
Jamminder Bhullar: First, I had a question for Steve Goulart. On -- if you think about the credit environment, obviously, things haven't ended up being as bad as was feared, but there's still uncertainty. So where do you see good value? And what are some of the areas that you might be avoiding? And then relatedly, can you talk about what your new money yields are that you're earning right now versus -- and the gap between that and the portfolio yields, so we get a better idea for where your core spreads are headed?
Steven Goulart: Jimmy, let's step back and just talk about the current environment, though. And John made some comments on this, too, and then I'll pick up. But we're still dealing crisis in the markets. And in our mind, that's presented a fair amount of uncertainty around what the shape of the recovery would look like. And what long-term impacts could be. Now we all know, Fed came to the rescue and through really unprecedented intervention has calmed the markets. And in general, the market tone have certainly improved where we were a quarter ago. And when you look at things like a lot of the downgrade projections that were in the market, just about all those participants have reduced their projections however, we are still seeing defaults and bankruptcies, and that trend is going to continue. If you think back to our first quarter call, we talked about how we are looking at that, different scenarios and analyses we've made and what the potential impact would be on our portfolio and on our risk-based capital, and what we said was through all the analysis we've done, we think that all the risks are manageable. So put that in the context of today, things have improved. The risk that we saw a quarter ago have also modestly improved.  And therefore, I guess, I'd describe it as continuing to be very manageable. But all that said, we are still very cautious about the market because there is a disconnect, we think, between kind of technicals and fundamentals. So we continue to be cautious. We've continued to reposition the portfolio. When we see price and spread action like we've seen in some sectors and names that we are still cautious about, we're going to continue and have continued to reduce our exposure. At the same time, though, there are attractive opportunities, and we're going to take advantage of them when we can. Particularly we've seen over the last quarter, continued opportunities in private assets, and so we'll continue to invest there. So again, it's really one of balance about continuing to take advantage of what the market will give us to lighten up the portfolio in those sectors and names that we are so cautious about. But taking advantage of opportunities that we see, which, again, right now seem to be more heavily concentrated, again, no surprise in private assets, which, again, given our strong origination networks, our reputation of commitment to those sectors and our conservative underwriting really serve us well. And I think that's when you just look at our commitment to sound underwriting to asset liability management, and most importantly, to diversification across the portfolio that allows us to really continue to put up a long term positive, successful investing track record even in markets like this.
Jamminder Bhullar: And are you able to quantify this your new money yields? And where they stand relative to the gap between that and the portfolio?
Steven Goulart: Yes. So our new money yield for the quarter was 3.41%. Our roll off was 3.72. And that reflects -- I think that's down a little bit from the last quarter, but it does reflect still being able to take advantage of opportunities that we do see. In the market. And again, we're obviously in a prolonged low interest rate and for now anyway, tighter spread environment. So that trend is likely to continue in the near term. But again, the diversification that we have available for us from an investing perspective will continue to serve us well.
Jamminder Bhullar: Okay. And then if I could just ask one more for John McCallion. On your annual actuarial review, in the past, you've brought your rate assumption down, but the adjustments have been fairly modest. Are you following a similar process as you're looking at your rate assumption? Or could we -- adjustments would be closer to what actual rates are?
John McCallion: Jimmy. Yes. We have a process. We will follow our processes we typically have. And we'll go through that during the course of the third quarter and provide an update on next quarter's earnings call. I don't think there's reasons to change. I don't think it I would call the environment would require a change in process, process should dictate and drive the results. So I think we have a very healthy process, objective process. And we'll kind of manage through that over the course of the next several weeks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.
Humphrey Lee: I just have a follow-up question on group benefits to trend for the balance of the year. Clearly, this quarter, you mentioned you had the $500 million impact related to dental. Do you anticipate any of the unearned premium reserves are all kind of behind you? And since you go back to normal? Or do you anticipate there could still be a little bit of a headwind because not the entire country is still fully open?
Ramy Tadros: Humphrey, it's Ramy Tadros here. So as John mentioned, we are expecting the utilization of some of the services for dental to be elevated or more than -- above our normal expectations for the rest of the year. So think of that, our customers are making up services that were not provided in the second quarter. So there's that catch up effect. This additional catch-up effect will be offset by the release of the unearned premium reserve in the subsequent quarters. So we will get -- we will see that UPR, if you will, release into premiums as we see that catch-up effect happen with respect to utilization. More broadly, with respect to PFO growth in the third quarter, we did talk about employment levels being one of the key drivers that drives PFO here for the group benefits business. If you recall, we talked about a number of attributes on the last call, which somewhat mitigate that employment level impact in terms of the diversification of our book, the focus towards more larger accounts, national accounts, so in aggregate, if you think about the third quarter, we are still looking at PFO growth in the solid mid digits for group benefits.
Humphrey Lee: Got it. And then in John's prepared remarks, you talked about the expecting some longevity benefits in the third quarter to offset some of the continued corporate-related underwriting impact. Is there any way to help us to think about the potential benefits from RIS and long-term care in the coming quarters?
John McCallion: Humphrey. Yes. Look, I would probably put this in the context of just overall view. Of underwriting. So just as a reminder as to what Michelle mentioned, overall, for 2Q, we saw a modest impact in underwriting on a combined basis. We had higher claims in the U.S., and they were largely offset by auto claims, auto frequency claims. Also, we had some longevity impacts in the quarter. And then we had other claims and utilization benefits outside the U.S., particularly EMEA. As we look into the Q3 end of kind of a neutral impact on underwriting on a combined basis to still be the case even with death rising to 200,000 in the U.S. So a couple of things to highlight. We expect the mortality, as I said before, on my opening remarks for Group Life and MetLife Holdings to still be elevated, albeit migrating closer to the top end of our range. So not as severe as 2Q. And just particularly in Mexico, we expect COVID impact to rise in Q3. So we're forecasting about 40,000 deaths in Q3 for Mexico. And at this point, we'd estimate that would have roughly maybe a segment benefit ratio. And then going to your point around offsetting impacts. So offsetting these elevated losses, we do expect longevity offsets to increase in both R and long-term care as these typically are delayed by a quarter or are slower to emerge from a reporting perspective. And then as I said in my remarks, we also expect EMEA would migrate back to normal trends. So in summary, we think the net underwriting result would generally offset, and therefore, COVID impacts would remain modest in Q3.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Crédit Suisse.
Andrew Kligerman: Maybe just kind of following up on the capital management question, taking more of the M&A stack. Do you think that if any opportunities were to arise in this environment that you'd be able to act pretty quickly? And do you have a desire to do so? And then finally, you mentioned the pet insurance acquisition. I've been hearing that, that's just a very tough line to underwrite as pets age, it becomes quite problematic in terms of the loss ratio. So I was wondering what the thinking was when you made that acquisition. So questions there.
Michel Khalaf: Andrew, I'll take the first part on capital management, and then Ramy will question. So as I've said before, we view M&A as a strategic and that's an important tool, but 1 of the tools in our toolbar. We're very disciplined in our approach to M&A. I would just remind that we always look at strategic fit as a potential transaction going to help us grow revenues? Are there synergies involved? It would have to be accretive. Does it clear a minimum risk-adjusted return, hurdle rate or return? And we always also compare it to other potential uses of capital. So I would say that nothing changes here in terms of our approach. We are open for business. And -- but the discipline that I just described, we -- with these types of opportunities.
Andrew Kligerman: Michel, any areas that I though that you kind of would like to add to the net life portfolio in terms of M&AS?
Michel Khalaf: Yes. I mean, just taking you back, Andrew, to what we discussed during Investor Day, I think we talked about sort of certain lines of business markets where given the right opportunity, we'd certainly be open to doing something. And I think if just sort of to add to that, if you consider sort of the pet insurance acquisition, a smaller acquisition that we made in digital wells, which complement our legal plans offering again, adding or enhancing our group benefits offering, for example, group obviously is a business that we like here in the U.S. So those are the types of things that I would point you to in terms of going back to what we discussed during Investor Day and the businesses and the markets that we -- that we like and where we see opportunities to further grow revenues.
Ramy Tadros: Andrew, it's Ramy here. Just building on Michel's comment, the first acquisition was small, but important. It very much is aligned to our Investor Day strategy. And we're entering into a capital-light business, where we've identified a clear opportunity where we can bring value to customers, employers and employees. The pet insurance market, if you look at it more broadly, 2/3 of Americans have a path. They spend collectively $18 billion every year on vet care. But the penetration in the market is -- in the insurance market is just 2%. And it's seeing 20% CAGR year-on-year. And clearly, look, the -- we have -- we've purchased a company with immense data and history. We have our best actuaries working on this, and we're very much confident in our underwriting in this line of business going forward.
Operator: And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Michel Khalaf for final comments.
Michel Khalaf: Let me thank you all for participating in today's call. And I want to close today by reiterating how committed this leadership team has to controlling was in our power to control. We know that capital and liquidity, consistent execution and expense management are vital during times of uncertainty. Please stay safe, and have a great day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-07 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's 8-K filed last night and its other SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Now more than ever, we appreciate you joining us for MetLife's first quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features disclosures and GAAP reconciliations, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. And fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Before I turn the call over to Michel, I have a quick scheduling update. As you might have concluded, given the environment, we will not be hosting an Investor Day in Tokyo this September. Now, over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd to begin by acknowledging the difficulties and challenges that so many people have injured as a result of the pandemic. What the world has been living through its tragic, yet it is also demonstrating the best of humanity. We see this every day as thousands of first responders, health care workers and other frontline employees risk their lives to care for others and provide essential services. And we see it at MetLife as our employees go above and beyond to deliver on our promises to customers. While we feel the effects of the crisis deeply, both the personal loss and the economic disruption, these are the moments that MetLife is built for. At our Investor Day last December, I led with the importance we place on being a purpose-driven company. Our purpose statement always with you, building a more confident future has taken on greater meaning in the current environment. People are counting on us like never before to provide the value, support and financial security they need. Our next horizon strategy is a road map for how the company will create value for all of its stakeholders: our people, our customers, our shareholders and our communities. As I have said before, it is our people who will deliver for our customers, and that in turn is how we will create value for our shareholders and communities. It starts with our people, which means making their health and well-being our top priority. We've done that in a variety of ways. We rapidly moved employees to a work-from-home environment, expanded benefit to help cover COVID-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support to help employees cope with stress and deployed tools and resources to keep people connected. I am proud of the level of engagement and motivation our people are showing, they know they are making a difference. Since we do business in many markets, MetLife got an early look at how the pandemic could affect societies and our own operations. Our experience in Asia gave us a running start on the activation of our business continuity plan globally. Across our enterprise, 92% of our 38,000 non-agent employees are now working from home, including 98% in the United States. Of course, the true test of our business continuity plan was not merely whether employees could log on from home but whether they had full functionality to be able to deliver for our customers. On this front, we are very pleased that we've been able to maintain service levels with 95% of all customer calls, claims and other transactions successfully handled by employees working remotely. This includes our group insurance business, where even in this highly disrupted environment, MetLife still expects to meet or exceed its performance guarantees. For our customers, this moment is crucial. The way we show up now will resonate with them for years to come. Across the enterprise, we are acting to provide them with comprehensive and compassionate care. We are extending premium grace period, fast-tracking claims, crediting or adjusting auto and dental premiums and providing our digital financial wellness portal to small businesses and their employees at no cost. The shutdown of face-to-face distribution has also spurred us to innovate and accelerate the digital transformation of our business. In China, for example, sales of our medical reimbursement product rose sharply after we created a WeChat store for agents. In times of prices, we must do more for the communities where we work and live. MetLife Foundation has committed $25 million and MetLife has donated millions of dollars and thousands of masks, disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizers to the COVID-19 spike. We also had a unique opportunity to help. As a large commercial real estate investor, we were pleased to work with the State of New York to offer the Intercontinental Times Square as free housing for medical workers. Most impactful is the social and economic benefit MetLife create as a life insurance company. The heart of our business is a promise to pay when people need us most. For the power of risk putting, the premiums of the many become payment to those who need them. MetLife paid more than $24 billion in policyholder claims, benefits and dividends in the U.S. alone last year, an average of more than $65 million a day. At a time when peoples' jobs and income are at risk, life insurers form a vital part of the social safety net that sustains people financially. MetLife entered the current period of uncertainty from the position of strength. As you know, we've made substantial changes to our strategy and product portfolio. The biggest change is to the profile of our liabilities. We are now a less market-sensitive and capital-intensive company. At our Investor Day, we showed that approximately two thirds of our adjusted earnings came from protection and fee-based products and only one third from spread-related businesses. Within our investment portfolio, we took early action in anticipation of a recession. Beginning in 2018, we became concerned about certain lower-rated areas of the credit markets. We reduced our holdings in sectors and names that we thought would carry heightened risk in a downturn. Overall, our investment portfolio is marked by broad diversification, high quality and ample liquidity. Notably, at our operating insurance companies, we have nearly $100 billion of U.S. government and agency securities, Japan government bonds and other cash and short-term investments. MetLife has also further strengthened its already strong capital and liquidity position. As part of our planned capital actions, in late March, we accessed the bond market when few others could to raise $1 billion. For the quarter, this helped bring the company's total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $5.3 billion. Our combined U.S. NAIC risk-based capital ratio as of year-end 2019 was 395%, and we enjoy higher ratings from all major credit-rating agencies. Another proactive step we've taken is to increase our focus on expenses. MetLife remains committed to meeting the expense target we set as part of our unit cost initiative program. In the current environment, perhaps no area gives us greater opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to consistent execution than expense discipline. As we announced last week, our financial strength enabled us to increase our quarterly common stock dividend, which provides a steady and growing source of income to millions of people during this economically challenging time. We raised our second quarter 2020 common stock dividend by 4.5% which illustrates our confidence in MetLife's future. Given our strong starting position, we expect the impact of the pandemic to be an earnings event, not a balance sheet event. MetLife has a great set of globally diversified businesses, some of which may be pressured by today's unprecedented events while others act as offsets. Take our Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, business. While we are seeing a slowdown in new pension risk transfer deals, we are also seeing a surge in demand for our stable value offerings as 401(k) sponsors and participants seek the safety of these book value products backed by MetLife. And although rollover reinvestment rates continue to be pressured for our long-tailed businesses in RIS, the current configuration of the yield curve, very low at the short hand and a positive slope, is favorable for our capital markets, investment products and securities lending activities. Similar balance exists across our global protection businesses, where mortality, morbidity, longevity and Property & Casualty risks serve as natural offsets. At the core, our scale, strong balance sheet and broad diversification are key strengths of our franchise. These trends enabled us to generate first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.58 per share, up 7% from a year ago. The direct impacts on our adjusted earnings from the pandemic and economic slowdown were limited. Adjusted earnings reflected strong underwriting margins and group benefits and favorable underwriting margins in Property & Casualty. Variable investment income was very strong mostly due to private equity, which is registered on a one quarter lag. These positives were offset in part by unfavorable market factors across interest rates, equities and foreign currency. Net income was $4.4 billion or $4.75 per share, up from $1.40 per year prior. Falling interest rates drove substantial gains in the derivatives we hold to protect our balance sheet. Book value per excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, was $52.36, up 7% sequentially from year-end while adjusted return on equity on the same basis totaled 12.6%. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate the greatest earnings impact will be felt within variable investment income, where we expect less favorable private equity returns for a time. The strong historical returns associated with our private equity portfolio and its role as a good match for our long-dated liabilities justify this asset class as an important ongoing component of the general account. In fact, the current economic turmoil is precisely the environment where the speeds of tomorrow's private equity returns are being planted. We believe our Next Horizon strategy was the right approach before the pandemic struck, and we are even more confident that the pillars of focus, simplify and differentiate are the right approach today. By focusing even more intently on where we deploy capital and by further simplifying the company, we will enable MetLife to emerge from the current environment in the best shape possible. If anything, we must accelerate our Next Horizon work. This is how we will truly differentiate MetLife and capture the opportunities that periods of disruptions always bring. MetLife has seen many such periods during this history, the 1918 flu pandemic, The Great Depression, World War II, 9/11, the financial crisis. Through all of them, we never faltered. We maintained our financial strength, kept our promises and provided people with the security and confidence they need. That's what we mean when we say, always with you, and it will be true throughout this pandemic and beyond. I will now turn the call over to John McCallion.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the first quarter 2020 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information on our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slides provide more detail on our investments, outlook for the second quarter as well as an update of our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3. This schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $4.4 billion, or approximately $3 billion higher than adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. This variance is primarily due to net derivative gains resulting from the significant decline in interest rates during the quarter. The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. Turning to Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $55 million associated with our unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate & Other. Excluding the unit cost in the first quarter of 2019, adjusted earnings were down 2% and essentially flat on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 3% and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong variable investment income, solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and lower taxes. This was offset by equity market weakness, lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting compared to first quarter of 2019. Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group benefits adjusted earnings were down 9% year-over-year. The group life mortality ratio was 87.9%, which is slightly above the midpoint of our annual target range of 85% to 90%, but less favorable to the exceptionally strong prior year quarter of 85.3%, which was the best first quarter mortality ratio in over 15 years. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 71.7%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 72.9%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from higher claim recoveries, lower incidents and lower severity. With regards to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% due to solid growth across all markets. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 26% year-over-year. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 114 basis points, up 18 basis points year-over-year and up 8 basis points sequentially. Spreads in the quarter benefited from higher private equity returns and a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 9% driven by very strong growth in the second half of 2019 and exceptionally strong stable value sales in the quarter, which benefited from a flight-to-safety amid the turbulent equity markets as well as opportunistic issuances in our capital markets investment products. While liability exposures grew, RIS PFOs were down 32% due to the mix of sales in the quarter, driven by lower structured settlement and income annuity sales. Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 12% versus the prior year. The overall combined ratio is 91%, which was below our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter of 92.2%. P&C results benefited from favorable non-catastrophe weather in homeowners and auto. P&C auto also benefited from lower auto frequency over the last two weeks of the quarter due to the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 2% and flat on a constant currency basis. Solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% and 9% on a constant currency basis. This was offset by less favorable underwriting margins, unfavorable equity markets in Japan and Korea, and lower investment margins. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 29% and down 19% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year driver was lower equity markets impacting our Chilean encaje returns, which was a negative 11% in the quarter versus a plus 5% return in 1Q of 2019. Excluding the impact from encaje, Latin America adjusted earnings were up 23% on a constant currency basis due to higher investment margins, solid volume growth and favorable underwriting. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 9% and down 6% on a constant currency basis as lower equity markets and less favorable underwriting margins were partially offset by better expense margins and solid volume growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by adverse equity markets. The separate account return in the quarter was a negative 14.4%, which was better than the 20% decline in the S&P as roughly 30% of funds are allocated to fixed accounts. This resulted in a negative $20 million initial impact, which compares to an approximately $15 million positive initial impact in first quarter of 2019. With regards to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 51%, which is near the bottom end of our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $138 million, excluding $55 million of UCI costs. The company’s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 17.5% and 20.2% on a run rate basis when adjusting for a favorable $45 million tax benefit in the quarter. Now let’s turn to Page 5 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $351 million earned in the first quarter of 2020. Our private equity portfolio, which is generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, had another solid quarter. With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.56% versus a roll-off rate of 3.92% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.04% and a roll-off rate of 4.15% in first quarter of 2019. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship, but wider credit spreads in the quarter have provided an offset. Now on Page 6, the chart on Page 6 highlights our strong historical private equity returns. Steve Goulart presented a version of this slide at Investor Day, showing private equity returns going back to 2016. Given the focus on our private equity in the current environment, we’ve decided to expand this view showing returns going back to the financial crisis in 2008. Our private equity portfolio was $7.6 billion as of March 31, which represents less than 2% of the general account assets under management. It is well-diversified across strategy, geography and portfolio managers and provides a good fit against long-term liabilities. As you can see from the chart, our private equity investments have generated an average return of 12% since 2008, and only in 2009 the trough of the financial crisis that this portfolio failed to generate a positive return. These next two slides are shown – were shown at our Investor Day, but they’re helpful reminders. On Page 7 you can see our portfolio loss history since 2008. The chart highlights a strong track record of performance as our cumulative impairment rate of 1.2% is roughly half that of the industry peer group. It also speaks to MetLife Investment Management’s culture of disciplined underwriting, deep fundamental analysis and strong risk management, with a particular focus on private asset origination. Turning to Page 8, as we’ve discussed previously, we have been proactive in improving the quality of our portfolio with a focus on significantly reducing our exposure to below-investment-grade credit and syndicated bank loans. We are also highly focused on our low BBB exposure given fallen angel risk. Our BBB minus credit exposure is roughly 4% of the general account AUM and 46% of this is private placements, which benefit from better financial covenants in place. I would also call to your attention, Page 14 in the appendix, which displays that we have relatively modest fixed maturity exposures to stress sectors. You can see our largest exposure on the chart is our energy portfolio of approximately $8.7 billion, of which 85% is investment grade. The energy portfolio is well diversified across subsectors and issuers. And we believe it is defensively positioned given the changes that we have made since the last downturn for the energy sector back in 2016. Turning to Page 9, this chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and first quarter of 2020. Through year-end 2019, we have achieved 170 basis points improvement in our direct expense ratio. And while we expect top line pressure in 2020, we remain committed to achieving our 12.3% full year target as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset, to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm. Now I’d like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the second quarter, given the uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10 with further detail offered by segment on Page 13 in the appendix. Starting with investments. As Michel indicated, we anticipate the largest impact of the current environment to manifest in variable investment income with the return on our private equity portfolio. While we received a limited number of PE reports to date, our best estimate for the second quarter is a negative high-single to low double-digit return. In thinking about our recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure, but reinvestment rates held reasonably steady during the first quarter as credit spreads widened to offset falling treasury rates and also provided good reinvestment opportunities. During the last week of March, we were able to invest roughly $2 billion in high-quality investments that yielded on average 5.4%. Additionally, while interest rates remained low, the curve has steepened, which improves margins in our capital market products and RIS in our securities lending program. Moving on to underwriting margins. Broadly speaking, we anticipate modest underwriting impacts on a combined basis in the second quarter from COVID-19, but there are many moving parts. To date, while we’ve seen limited impact from COVID-19 on life claims in the U.S., we do expect this to increase during the second quarter. However, claims activity in dental has declined and auto claims frequency is down with fewer miles driven. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis in 2Q. Turning to top line metrics. We would expect 2Q sales to be challenged in most of our markets with risk of further pressure in future quarters. Additionally, as Michel mentioned, for April and May, we’ve provided a 15% premium credit for MetLife personal auto customers and a 20% premium adjustment for our fully-insured dental business within group benefits for the two months. As far as variable product sensitivities to equity markets, our Investor Day guidance offered back in December still holds. While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, efficiency mindset continues to be a core tenet of our strategy and managing margin pressures across our business. And as I noted earlier, our plans include meeting our direct expense ratio, full year target of 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment. I will now discuss cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, which is up from $4.2 billion at December 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.1 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, preferred stock and debt issuances as well as holding company expenses. During the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of net common shares with $485 million remaining on our current authorization. We have not been in the market since early March, which we believe to be prudent at this time. Our cash balances are high. Our next debt maturity is December 2022, and we like the optionality and financial flexibility those balances provide us at this time. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Using market inputs at the end of the first quarter, interest rates following the observable forward yield curves as of March 31 and equity markets down 20% in 2020, we estimate that our average free cash flow ratio for the two-year period, 2019 and 2020, will hold within our target range of 65% to 75%. Looking forward to the two-year period of 2020 to 2021 and assuming the same March 31, 2020, forward yield curves and a return to normal 5% equity market growth in 2021, we estimate our free cash flow would be within a range of 40% to 60%. This range occurs as we estimate some level of credit losses due to the pandemic over the next 12 to 24 months and some level of additional reserves would be established under current New York cash flow testing requirements, which would impact dividend capacity at our New York domicile statutory company, metropolitan life insurance company, or MLIC. We would not expect such reserves to be required under NAIC standards, and therefore, would not impact our combined NAIC RBC levels. For our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2020 statutory operating losses were approximately $650 million and net income was approximately $260 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $1.9 billion from the prior year, primarily due to higher VA reserves. Net income was mostly driven by derivative gains in the quarter. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.4 billion as of March 31, 2020, up $2.8 billion from $18.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Derivative gains more than offset operating losses in the first quarter of 2020. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 931% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter despite the significant volatility in the capital markets due to COVID-19. Looking ahead, we expect our second quarter adjusted earnings to be dampened by negative private equity returns, but our underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses to remain intact. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are resilient and well positioned to manage through this challenging environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Good morning. John, just to follow up on the updated free cash flow guidance. The – can you provide a little more color on how this works? How much of the impact would be related to interest rates and credit, because I know you mentioned both? And is it as simple as just thinking there would be AAT reserves of around $1 billion a year for 2020 and 2021. Is this the right way to think about this? And then just my follow-up would be, you had a competitor announce a big long-term care reserve charge recently after a regulatory review. Just want to see whether there’s anything similar going on with New York regulators in MetLife. Thanks.
John McCallion: Good morning, Tom. So on the first question, let me start by saying, I wouldn’t call it guidance, right? This is – let’s just be clear what our objective here is to provide a scenario. We anchored it on some data or market data as of March 31. So it was really to provide a scenario of free cash flow. And one, we’re considering a level of credit losses and downgrades based on our bottom-up analysis that our investment team has been working through and monitoring and thinking it will play out over a 12- to 24-month period. And two, looking at the potential impact of New York cash flow testing requirements using last year’s requirements. And remember, we get a special consideration letter every year and then considering any new requirements that we’re aware of. And so there, we applied those factors to estimate some level of cash flow testing reserves, again, based on March 31 macro factors. And as I said, Steve and team put forth a bottoms-up review to a value to range of credit losses. And for cash flow testing, we picked a point more stressful than where we are today, that being March 31, where interest rates – while interest rates are similar, credit spreads were wider back then, equity markets were lower then. I would also point you to just directionally the shape of the curve is more favorable. Actually, it’s more favorable than, I’d say, a year-end base case we used at the outlook call, just given the shape of the curve, given the significant drop in the short end. And then also, as I said, credit spreads, they’re important as well in this, and they have narrowed since March 31. So I think it’s important that to also know that we get this letter every year. The letter we – the requirements were used from last year’s letter was based on a different macroeconomic environment. So we’re – every year, we work through with New York in a constructive way, and we’re cautiously optimistic we’ll come to a regional place, but we wanted to give some sensitivity. And I think the other thing I would just add – this is, I would say, consistent with the direction that we’ve given in the past, right? We’ve said that our free cash flow range of 65% to 75% holds with a 10-year treasury of 1.5% to 4.5%. And then as rates go below that, we would expect that to decline for a year or a two-year average, I should say. And I think that’s kind of what we’re trying to share here. And then on LTC. So yes, look, I don’t – I’m not going to comment on someone else’s situation. For us, we work with New York every year. So we – I wouldn’t say there’s anything in particular for us. And we’re always looking at our reserves, and there’s nothing to point out different than what we’re seeing every year.
Tom Gallagher: All right. Thanks, John. And just one quick follow-up, if I could. Is the plan to stay paused with buyback? Or any color you can give on what you’re thinking about the buyback?
Michel Khalaf: Hi, Tom, it’s Michel. So as John mentioned, we completed $500 million in Q1, buybacks in Q1. We have $45 million left on our current authorization. Since early March, just given the stressed environment, we’ve been prudent to preserve and maintain capital and maintain optionality. There’s no change in our philosophy, I would say, in terms of – excess capital belongs to shareholders. We’d expect to distribute all free cash flow in the form of dividends and share buybacks while maintaining sufficient liquidity for stress events. Also, if you think about our liquidity buffer $3 billion to $4 billion, and we’re maintaining cash in excess of that, given the uncertain economic environment. And again, we believe that that’s the prudent thing to do. So we’re going to continue to evaluate the situation. We’ll assess our liquidity position based on business and macro conditions. And we’ll sort of – we’re in a – I would say, we’ve had the pause button for the time being, but we’ll continue to monitor things and decide when would be an appropriate time to resume buybacks.
Tom Gallagher: All right. Thanks, Michel.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hi, good morning. Back to the free cash flow generation, I just want to maybe just clarify one thing. If rates remain low as in the scenario that you expressed, would that basically create one year of additional asset adequacy testing serves to account for that? And then after you made that reserve addition, you’d go back more towards normal cash flow afterwards?
John McCallion: Hey, Ryan, it’s John. Yes, I think that’s fair. As I said, again, those were off of March 31 rates. Rates are different today. It’s an estimate. We haven’t – that we apply. We go through a much more longer process to get to the final reserve number. So again, that’s why there’s a wide range there of outcomes. But I think directionally, the way to think of it is, it has an impact on one year’s free cash flow.
Ryan Krueger: Got it. Thanks. And then on your commercial mortgage loan portfolio, can you give us any statistics on kind of forbearance requests and how much has been granted so far?
Steve Goulart: Hey, Ryan, it’s Steve Goulart. Sure. I mean, obviously, we’ve been expecting to see elevated activity in this. I’ll start by reminding you and everyone else, about the portfolio itself, $50 billion of commercial mortgages with a loan-to-value ratio of 55% for the entire portfolio, 2.4 times debt service coverage. So again, a very secure, low-risk portfolio in our mind. Obviously, in this time, we are seeing elevated requests, as you’d expect, particularly in retail and hotels for forbearance request. We have been getting requests. We have a committee that deals with each and every one. Certainly, we believe that some of these make sense to grant and that’s what we’ve been doing. 90% of the requests have come from hotel and retail. And they’re typically for deferral of interest and/or principal, and typically, what we’ve been granting is in the range of three to four months of forbearance. And remember, it’s forbearance, not forgiveness. So we do expect that these will always be paid. And by the way, we saw virtually no impact on April payments for the portfolio overall. But basically, we’ve granted forbearance on essentially sort of just less than 2% of the total premium balance outstanding at this point in time.
Ryan Krueger: Got it. And then in April, you had almost all of the loans pay?
Steve Goulart: Correct.
Ryan Krueger: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Nigel Dally: Great. Thanks and good morning. A question on group insurance. Should we be taking some deterioration in the margins given this back-end unemployment? I know it’s typically related to disability claims. And just wanted to get your perspective as to whether that’s a headwind we should be watching out for?
Ramy Tadros: Hey, Nigel, it’s Ramy here. Well, maybe just on underwriting, stepping back and giving you an overall context across the U.S. business. We do have significant diversification across the U.S. business. So think about mortality and longevity across the group and the RIS businesses. And then we also have diversification within each one of those businesses. So if you were to focus on group your question, the current environment is leading to various offsets and give and takes across the product lines. We are seeing favorable impacts in dental, given the lower utilization. We’re seeing actually unfavorable impacts on the life block. And I would say, to date, on the short-term disability block, it’s been a push. We’ve seen an increased number of COVID-related incidents but that’s been more than offset in a decrease in other short-term disability claims, so think issues like elective surgeries and the like. So at this stage, while there’s still some uncertainty, I mean, relating to the overall number of deaths in the U.S. and the impact on the insured population versus the general population, it’s very reasonable to expect at this stage that the overall impact would more or less offset each other on a full year basis.
John McCallion: Maybe I’ll just add to a couple of points to what Ramy mentioned. So because you referenced, I think, unemployment, Nigel. And so a couple of things to point out here. One is that the segment that’s been hardest hit, which is small business. I think our total premiums there are at $1 billion. So it’s not a major component of our current portfolio. And two, if you think about our disability business, it’s 11%, as we showed on Investor Day of our total earnings. So – and obviously, there, we’ve been also taking steps from a pricing perspective in terms of the guarantees that we provide on – from a rate perspective to make sure that we are also well positioned for a downturn scenario.
Nigel Dally: That’s great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning, everyone. I had a couple of questions. First, your investment portfolio, can you discuss if you’ve run any stress test on what would happen to your capital and/or your RBC ratio in sort of a mild recession, deep recession? I appreciate your comments in terms of qualitatively, but anything that you’re able to share in terms of numbers on that.
Steve Goulart: Hi, Jimmy, it’s Steve Goulart again. Let me start by just reminding everybody, I know you probably think I sound like a broken record when I do this, but we’ve been prepositioning this portfolio for a downturn since 2018. And that’s been our outlook – remember what we talked about at Investor Day, John updated some of those slides. But even going back to Investor Day, we’ve continued to reduce sectors that we were very concerned about below investment grade. We reduced by another $600 million since Investor Day, bank loans also another $600 million since Investor Day. And I think I would have to say, and I think anybody, as you talk to who are involved in investments, would say that we’ve entered this crisis period in better shape than we probably ever have in the past. So we’re very comfortable moving into it. John showed a slide about sensitive sectors and the like, we’ve been analyzing the portfolio a number of different ways. We run it through a number of different tests and lenses. Frankly, many of you out there have actually conducted your own reviews. We actually go through every one of those in detail and just sort of compare to our own. We’ve done longer-term analysis using external models from the rating agencies and other outside experts. We've done a portfolio, kind of, top-down approach comparing the portfolio now to previous crises and downturns, emphasizing the sensitive exposures and how the portfolio has changed since those crises and imputing our historical default and loss experiences in those time periods. But John mentioned what we've actually spent the most time on is the real specific bottom-up individual exposure analysis by our credit and real estate research teams. Again, our core strength is in credit and structured underwriting, and we've been using them to really go through the portfolio to help us assess this. And the result is a very granular assessment of our exposures, we think, are vulnerable to downgrades and losses. And in this analysis, particularly, we really thought of it in two ways. One is sort of a nearer-term recovery, does the economy start opening up, say, sometime in the summer, or really, is it kind of a year-end scenario before the economy starts reopening. And the bottom line assessment is based on what we foresee today, the impact of downgrades and possible losses on our capital in these scenarios is very manageable. That analysis put possible losses of up to $1.4 billion over time, as John said, likely to occur over kind of a 12 to 24 month period and the impact on RBC from downgrades, in that, we would estimate also up to about 25 basis points as well. So again what I would say again is we’ve been preparing for this. In this environment, we expect losses and downgrades above normal. But based on the prepositioning we've done and based on what we noted that we feel very comfortable and think our position is very sound.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And just one on the retirement business. Normally, you'd assume in a low rate environment, your spreads would actually be going down, but they've held in pretty well. So – and I'm assuming some of that's because of the benefit of this steeper yield curve. So assuming rates stay around here and the yield curves as steep as it is, would you expect your spread to hold up or potentially improve from these levels?
John McCallion: Yes, hi, Jimmy, it's John. Good morning. So yes, spreads were in line with what we've kind of been forecasting for the last few quarters as we said before and coming in at 114 basis points but ex-VII, 83 basis points. And we'll expect, given VII returns in Q2 that this will take our overall spread down and – in Q2. And just as a frame of reference for VII, 85% to 90% of our VII comes through three segments: it's RIS, MLH and Asia, and it's roughly third each. But let me focus on how the shape of the curve is improving spreads ex VII. And again, I think this highlights some of the diversification that we have in our business products and the tools that we have to deploy in different environments. And so we think for the remainder of this year, we would expect kind of 5 to 10 basis points improvement as a result of the – how the curve has changed, particularly even since March. I mean, if you just look at LIBOR, I think it's down 100 basis points since the end of the first quarter. And then maybe just to give you a quick update then on sensitivities because I know we gave those to you back at the outlook call. So now where LIBOR is, which is below 50 basis points, you know, our sensitivity would be for every 10-bit move, it would be a $10 million plus or minus depending on whether it goes up or down. The long-term sensitivity doesn’t change but the near term one does. So it almost doubles. So anyway, I thought I'd just provide that color as well.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, in the past, you guys have been asked about potential transactions within MetLife Holdings. You've also done speculations surrounding some sales of certain overseas businesses. So what is the current environment, including lower rates kind of impact the potential for transactions? And would you guys just – are you guys looking and feel, like, I guess, that could potentially free up capital between either of those two routes?
John McCallion: Good morning, Elyse. This is John. Yes, look we have said this before because I don't think we're necessarily – I know it's lower rates, but we've been in low rate environments for some time now, and they've gotten lower, certainly, over the last 12-plus months. And so it does put some pressure on that bid-ask spread as we talked about in holdings. And – but what we've said before is that these are complex blocks of business. And what we always urge the team to do is make sure we're continuing to take an external perspective, doing the work now because when things – if things were to change and those pricing points were to converge a little more, maybe supply gets even that much greater, there could be a various variety of things. We want to be ready and opportunistic if something makes sense for us. But I'd say, just all else equal, yes, lower rates puts pressure on doing something in holdings at this juncture.
Ramy Tadros: And just maybe more broadly, Elyse, I would sort of add that, obviously, a more challenging macro environment, we cannot ignore that. But it doesn't change our approach to sort of M&A in terms of how we view it. We continue to constantly look at our portfolio and also think through timing and what does – when does it make sense to maybe do something. So certainly, the environment makes M&A more challenging, I would say, broadly speaking, but it doesn't mean that we stop the work that we do in terms of assessing our businesses. And also, there might be opportunities coming out of this crisis that certainly will spend time also thinking through.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then on – in terms of PRT, can you just provide us on the outlook for that business? I would also think that there's probably been somewhat of an impact on deal flows, just given a low interest rate environment as well?
Ramy Tadros: Sure, and in terms of the overall pipeline, it has slowed due to the overall environment. A number of drivers within that, including the funding levels, the volatility in the capital markets, and frankly, the priorities of treasury and HR teams in the context of the pandemic. So we've seen a few deals that were pulled out or put on hold in the first quarter, and we're seeing a somewhat lighter pipeline. If activity were to kind of pick back up in the second half of the year, we expect to get our fair share. And I'd remind you that we were a top three player in that market last year. But when you think of RIS, again, remember, RIS has a lot more than PRT in it. PRT is one product line in the context of a diversified context. And as Michel and John referenced, we've seen a substantial pick up in our stable value business in the last quarter, and we're seeing very healthy over – year-over-year increase in the liability balances. And certainly for the full year in terms of liability balances, we'd expect to still be within the guidance range that we've talked about.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you for the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Hi, thank you. In the group business, can you help us think of the potential impact on premiums from the current environment? And how quickly would you start to see an impact? And does this differ materially by plan size?
Ramy Tadros: Sure, let me just maybe start by profiling the overall PFO mix and then talk about some of the dynamics coming out of that. So remember, 75% of our PFOs are coming from national accounts, so think large employers. And when you think about the headline unemployment numbers there that you're seeing in the economy, those have really disproportionately impact smaller employers, part-time workers and the like. And the other dynamic in our national accounts book that's important is that the ultimate impact that we would actually see is going to be also influenced by the benefit practices of certain large employers. So you've seen examples where employers have continued to provide benefits for furloughed workers. So that's kind of one just triangulation point for you. The other piece, when you think about top line for this business is that we have a diversified book by industry and geography. And just like what we do in the credit portfolio, we've done the same thing here in terms of looking at industries, which are most at risk in terms of unemployment levels and benefits being cut. And that percentage is just shy of 10% of our entire book. So as an example, hotels and leisure is less than 2%. So you put all of that together, you put the fact that we’re getting strong persistency above our expectations, we’re getting good renewal actions at expectations. You put all of that together, we'll see some headwinds to PFOs related to overall unemployment, but I would say we would still see some PFO growth for the full year, albeit modest and likely shy of the 4% to 6% range that we've talked about, but nevertheless, we will see growth. Two other points, just to bear in mind as you think about the timing, we have implemented a premium credit in our dental business for the months of April and May, given the significant drop in utilization of dental services. And we will align the dental premiums for the balance of 2020 with the expected utilization of services. So when you think about our Q2 number, we will be shifting some revenue recognition from Q2 to the second half of the year. And the second point to highlight here again in the context of $1 billion or so voluntary business that we talked about on our Investor Day, we talked about a 30% CAGR in that business, historically. We're still expecting for 2020 to still see double-digit CAGR in PFOs for voluntary. And while unemployment levels are a headwind, we have tailwinds here. We have increased awareness of the needs of – for this product, and we're starting from a place where there's relatively low penetration of these products with employee population.
Erik Bass: Thank you. That’s very helpful color. And then one for John, as we think about your GAAP interest rate assumption, is the sensitivity to changes still in line with what you've discussed in the past of rough $50 million per 25 basis point change? And is there a level where that kind of linearity changes, and I guess, loss recognition could become an issue for any of the blocks?
John McCallion: Good morning, Erik. So, I would say, to start, the answer – you kind of outlined it pretty well. In the beginning, the first few 25 bp reduction would be fairly consistent and then it would begin to grow. So if you said maybe the first – don't take this for like we've modeled it exactly, but let's say, the first two are roughly $50 million. And then if you move to another – the next 100 basis points, it would start to grow a little more each time. Look, we've actually done some sizing, rough sizing, and this isn't something that we're – there should be no indication of us making any change ahead of time or not. But we've looked at if it was 150 basis point move down, that would roughly be somewhere between $400 million and $450 million of an impact and no loss recognition testing impact still. So we have done some stress and sensitivities, but that's our best estimates at this time.
Erik Bass: Great, thank you. That’s helpful.
Operator: And at this time, I'd like to turn it back to Michel Khalaf for any closing comments.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you operator. When I took the job of CEO just over a year ago, I envisioned a lot of things happening during my first year on the job, the coronavirus was not one of them. At a time when we all need silver linings, mine is how MetLife's employees have stepped up for our customers. It's fashionable for companies to say they are purpose driven. The team at MetLife really walks the talk. I'm so privileged to lead this company at a time when we're making such a critical difference in peoples’ lives. Thank you for listening. Please stay safe, and have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note on the forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. Joining me this morning on the call are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features a number of disclosures and GAAP reconciliations, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. The headline from our financial results is that MetLife had a solid underlying fourth quarter and a very strong year. Our track record of consistent execution continues, and this leadership team is committed to being a top-performing company. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we delivered adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings rose to $1.98 from $1.35 a year earlier. Net income in the quarter was $536 million, driven by mark-to-market losses on interest rate-related derivatives that we hold to protect our balance sheet. Backing out the impact of notable items, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.53, up 21% year-over-year. The positive drivers included market factors, volume growth and capital management, offset in part by higher seasonal expenses as we indicated would be the case. Adjusted return on equity in the quarter, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA and notables, was 12.6% compared with 11.7% in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2019, MetLife delivered very strong results. Net income was $5.7 billion, while adjusted earnings were $5.8 billion. We've spoken before about our efforts to bring net income and adjusted earnings into closer alignment, efforts that succeeded in 2019. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings rose 13% to $6.11, up from $5.39. Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings per share were $6.06, 10% higher than the prior year. The drivers were capital management and volume growth that more than offset the impact of lower recurring interest margins. Across our businesses, 2019 was a year of significant achievements. Our flagship U.S. group benefits business generated adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion, nearly double the earnings from this business just 3 years earlier. In retirement and income solutions, we booked nearly $4.3 billion of pension risk transfer sales, our second best year ever. Just as important, we delivered on our commitment that investment spreads would fall within a range of 100 to 125 basis points. Despite declining interest rates, we came in at 106 basis points. In both our Asia and Lat Am businesses, we delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth year-over-year, excluding total notable items on a constant currency basis. And within investments, we generated variable investment income of nearly $1.2 billion, largely on the strength of our private equity portfolio. Our competitive advantage and sourcing private assets provided significant protection for our investment portfolio. In a year when the 10-year treasury fell by 77 basis points, our net investment yield only declined by 2 basis points. Our strong business performance drove adjusted return on equity for the year, excluding AOCI other than FCTA and notables, to 13%, up 20 basis points from the prior year and right at the midpoint of our target range. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, grew nearly 10% to $48.97. And our direct expense ratio came in at 12.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over the prior year. As we have noted, our unit cost initiative is on track to deliver $900 million of margin expansion, which is $100 million above our initial commitment. MetLife's consistent execution in 2019 created significant shareholder value. Our robust free cash flow generation enabled us to return roughly $4 billion to shareholders in the form of common dividends and share repurchases. We deployed another $3.6 billion of capital to support new business at internal rates of return comfortably above our hurdle rate. And growing appreciation of our company's strength led to a total shareholder return of 29%. The strategic themes of focus, simplify and differentiate that we outlined at our December Investor Day were clearly on display in 2019 and will drive our decisions in the years ahead. On focus, we have reduced our footprint post the ALICO acquisition from 66 markets to 44, and in 2019, announced the sale of our Hong Kong business. We continue to look at our portfolio through the lens of strategic fit and deploy capital to businesses that can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted hurdle rate. We will be just as disciplined when it comes to optimizing our portfolio. Any transaction must be in the long-term interest of MetLife, offering either compelling economics or a significant reduction in our risk profile. On simplify, we will overdeliver on our UCI cost-saving target, and going forward, we'll adopt an efficiency mindset that will create an additional $1 billion of capacity to fund innovation and growth over the next five years. On differentiate, we will continue to capitalize on those competitive advantages that are difficult for others to replicate. We believe our group benefits business in the U.S. creates unmatched value for customers. And as we expand the platform with attractive benefits, such as pet insurance, digital wells and health savings accounts, we are very well positioned to extend our lead. In early January, we gathered 200 of MetLife's senior leaders at an off-site meeting to ensure we have full alignment on our strategy. Notably, 10 of our 12 Independent Directors were in attendance as well. There was tremendous energy and enthusiasm for the task before us, to be a purpose-driven company that creates superior value for its people, its customers and its shareholders. We have set bold aspirations for all our stakeholders, for our customers who are committed to building remarkable and enduring relationships. We are taking concrete steps to strengthen both our metrics and our leadership commitment to customer focus. For our people, we promised a culture that energizes them to make a difference. We are already making progress with our latest employee engagement survey, providing further evidence of the cultural evolution taking place at MetLife. When I look at MetLife's recent history, I see remarkable progress. A few years ago, we were in a de-risking phase where the emphasis was on the need to improve our cash flow. Then we reached the inflection point I spoke about last year, where we could pivot to a focus on responsible growth. Now we are in the next horizon, where we have fully transitioned to leveraging our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace, which brings me to our aspirations for our shareholders. I covered these in detail at Investor Day and will highlight the key points today. First, we will achieve an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14%. Second, we will dispense with serial expense programs in favor of an efficiency mindset that will generate $1 billion of additional capacity over 5 years. And third, we will maintain a 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75%, which will generate $20 billion of deployable cash over the next 5 years. In closing, we are pleased to deliver another solid quarter and very strong year that add to our record of consistent execution. We believe that MetLife's narrative and results are converging nicely. Our thesis is clear. We are a simpler and more focused company with a great set of businesses and strong free cash flow. Our track record in support of this thesis is equally clear. $900 million in projected expense savings, healthy growth in our most attractive businesses and consistent delivery of free cash flow in our 65% to 75% range. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 4Q '19 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. Starting on Page 3. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year of 2019. Net income in the fourth quarter was $536 million or $1.3 billion lower than adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from the increase in interest rates during the quarter. For the full year, net income of $5.7 billion largely mirrored adjusted earnings of $5.8 billion. The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continued to perform as expected. Notable items are shown on Page 4, and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. First, favorable tax items in the fourth quarter increased adjusted earnings by $475 million after tax or $0.51 per share. I'll provide more details on these tax items shortly. Second, as a result of the favorable tax items, there was a related release of interest on tax reserves of $64 million after tax or $0.07 per share, which is a reduction in and recorded through direct expenses as opposed to income taxes. Finally, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings in the quarter by $119 million after tax or $0.13 per share. For the full year, these costs were $332 million or $0.35 per share. As a reminder, fourth quarter of 2019 is the last quarter for this incremental spend, and therefore, there will be no UCI-related costs in 2020. Excluding notable items in the quarter, adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion or $1.53 per share. Page 5 provides further detail on the notable tax items in the quarter. First, we had a tax benefit of $317 million related to a settlement with the IRS regarding the U.S. tax reform repatriation transition tax. This settlement resolves uncertainty regarding the taxation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries paid prior to U.S. tax reform. Second, we had a tax benefit of $158 million from an IRS audit settlement relating to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. As some of you may recall, MetLife took a charge in the third quarter of 2015 related to this matter. We have now settled this issue for all audit years and the matter is closed. On Page 6, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year adjusted earnings, excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 13% and 14% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 21% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong equity market performance, continued strength in variable investment income, solid volume growth and favorable tax benefits. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins in the quarter. Turning to the performance of our businesses in the quarter. Group benefits adjusted earnings were up 43% year-over-year, driven by favorable underwriting, solid volume growth and higher investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins in the quarter. The group life mortality ratio was 85.4%, which is at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90% and favorable to the prior year quarter of 89.4% due to lower claims severity. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 71.4%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 73.2%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from renewal rate actions and higher claim recoveries. In addition to the strong bottom line, the business continues to grow its top line with adjusted PFOs in the quarter up 6% and full year sales up 11%, led by growth in voluntary products. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 10% year-over-year, driven by lower investment margins. RIS investment spreads were 106 basis points in 4Q '19, and while down 24 basis points year-over-year, spreads were up 4 basis points sequentially. For the full year 2019, investment spreads were also 106 basis points, which was within the 2019 guidance range. Looking ahead, we continue to expect spreads to remain within our 2020 guidance range of 90 to 115 basis points. RIS adjusted PFOs were up $2.6 billion year-over-year, driven by strong pension risk transfer deals of $2.5 billion in 4Q '19. As announced last week, this includes a $1.9 billion transaction with Lockheed Martin, which covers approximately 20,000 retirees and beneficiaries. The pipeline for PRTs remain strong, and we expect this to continue into 2020. Property and Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were down 75% versus 4Q '18, primarily due to unfavorable underwriting in the quarter. The overall combined ratio was 101.6%, driven by higher severity within auto bodily injury, including approximately 6 points from adverse prior year development. We are reassessing operational practices and have accelerated rate actions. Based on current trend and planned rate actions, we expect to be within our 2020 target combined ratios. With regards to the top line, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 1%, while sales were down 6% versus 4Q '18. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 21% and 23% on a constant currency basis. The positive year-over-year drivers were favorable volume growth as general account assets under management, excluding fair value adjustments, grew 9% as well as better investment margins and favorable equity markets. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting. Asia sales were down 16% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were down 23%, primarily driven by foreign currency denominated annuity products. FX annuity products, which are primarily sold through bank channels had another challenging quarter, given the contraction of the bank market. In addition, our A&H sales in Japan were down 10% year-over-year, which is a function of changes in the tax laws associated with certain products. We expect Japan sales to remain soft through the first half of 2020 before recovering. Other Asia sales were down 3%, but up 5%, excluding the impact from our divested Hong Kong operations, driven by growth in Korea. Latin America adjusted earnings were up 18% and 21% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year drivers were higher investment margins, solid volume growth, better expense margins and the favorable impact from capital markets on our Chile Encaje. These were partially offset by the less favorable underwriting compared to 4Q '18. Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 7% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower SPIA sales in Chile. Latin America sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher sales in Brazil and Mexico. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 20% and 22% on a constant currency basis. The main drivers were lower taxes and volume growth. These were partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 12% on a constant currency basis from growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 21% year-over-year, driven by the strength of the equity markets as well as favorable underwriting and investment margins. These were partially offset by less favorable expense margins, although primarily due to items that we do not expect to recur. With regard to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 55.5%, in line with seasonal expectations and favorable to 58% in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2019, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio, excluding notable items, was 52.9%, comfortably within the target range. Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $98 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $132 million due to lower taxes and favorable investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins. For the full year 2019, Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $608 million, which was within our 2019 guidance range of an adjusted loss of $550 million to $750 million. Excluding the notable and other favorable tax items, the company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 18.5% and within our 2019 guidance of 18% to 20%. As a reminder, our 2020 effective tax rate guidance is expected to be within 20% to 22%. Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $327 million earned in the fourth quarter. This was another solid performance for variable investment income. Our private equity portfolio, which is accounted for on a 1 quarter lag, had another solid quarter; and the quarter also contained higher mortgage prepayments. For full year 2019, VII was $1.2 billion pretax and above our 2019 guidance range of $800 million to $1 billion. As a reminder, our 2020 VII target range remains $900 million to $1.1 billion. With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.45% versus a roll-off rate of 4.17% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.24% and a roll-off rate of 4.4% in 4Q '18. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship. As we have noted previously, we would not expect parity to occur until we have a sustained U.S. 10-year treasury yield of roughly 3% to 3.25%. Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019. We have made consistent progress towards achieving our UCI target by 2020. 2019 marks another 30 basis point improvement versus 2018, and 170 basis point improvement overall from the baseline of 14.3% in 2015. The 4Q '19 direct expense ratio, excluding notable items and PRTs, came in above trend at 13.7%. As we've indicated, our expenses tend to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter due to higher enrollment and other costs incurred prior to receiving premiums in our group benefits business. In addition, the higher direct expense ratio reflects roughly 50 to 60 basis points of unfavorable items, primarily driven by higher employee benefit costs and higher corporate initiatives in the quarter. Despite the higher 4Q expenses, we are quite pleased with the overall progress that we have made in driving down the company's direct expense ratio, as demonstrated by the improvement of our full year results. We are on track to deliver a direct expense ratio of approximately 12.3% for full year 2020, which equates to an incremental $100 million of profit margin improvement over our original commitment. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at December 31, which is up from $3.5 billion at September 30. $700 million increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend as well as holding company expenses. In 2019, we returned approximately $4 billion of capital to shareholders, and our average 2018 and 2019 free cash flow ratio was 72% and within our 65% to 75% guidance. We remain committed to maintaining a 65% to 75% 2-year average free cash flow ratio over the near term. This target still holds with a 10-year treasury between 1.5% and 4.5%. Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, we estimate that our combined NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary 2019 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.5 billion and net earnings were approximately $4.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $164 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower VA rider reserves and improved underwriting results. These were mostly offset by the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2019, up 1% compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in operating earnings was partially offset by dividends paid to the holding company and derivative losses. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 904% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter to close out a very strong 2019. Our ability to leverage our diverse market-leading businesses to drive capital-efficient growth, while maintaining expense discipline across the firm, has led to a strong, consistent level of results in 2019. We grew book value per share by 10% year-over-year, while generating an adjusted ROE of 13%, excluding notable items. In addition, our cash and capital position as well as our balance sheet remain strong and resilient. Finally, we are confident the actions we are taking to become a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Crédit Suisse.
Andrew Kligerman: My first question is around the group benefits. So you mentioned that PFO, up 6%; sales, up 11%; the life benefits ratio was 85.4% against guidance of 85% to 90% and the Non-Med was 71.4% under the 72% to 77%, so it's clearly phenomenal. And it seems like quarter in, quarter out, you're doing this. So I want to get a sense of what's the pricing environment like right now? And when is it going to get a little uglier or get ugly at some point because it always does in insurance?
Ramy Tadros: Andrew, it's Ramy here. Phenomenal, I think we would say, it's a very strong quarter for us, and we're extremely pleased with those results. To give you some context around your question, if you think about this into 2020 and beyond, I would say a few things. One is that we are very confident in our fundamentals here. This is an attractive market. It has structural characteristics that make it attractive that we talked about. And we are a market leader here, and we do have sustainable competitive advantages that we continue to press. If you think about the specific results on the underwriting ratio, like you said, remember, this is an insurance business. So you do expect these ratios to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, they do have some seasonality to them, with first quarter typically being a bit elevated. The other thing you should think of as an insurance business is that the results that we're seeing are entirely within our expected range of outcomes in the context of our business. So if you look at 2020, our view of those ranges have not changed from the ones we've given you in December and our expectations for the full year remain the same and are in the mid -- towards the middle of that range. From a competitive environment, it is competitive. It's not irrational. We seek to differentiate on a lot of factors beyond price. And the other thing I would say, there's a lot of white space in this business, and we talked about the voluntary opportunity in particular, where we see white space for further growth.
Andrew Kligerman: Great. And then just on RIS. I guess, spreads were within the guided range of 90 to 115 at 106, as you said earlier, John. And I guess, could you share with us what the annual portfolio turnover is on that business? And what kind of new money yields you're getting as you move forward against the portfolio yield?
John McCallion: Good morning, Andrew. It's John. Yes, I would just -- maybe I'll start with the beginning part there and just say, this is consistent with what we expected, and we mentioned previously on the third quarter call, we started to see a bottoming of spreads, partly due to the anticipation of the benefit of 2 fed rate cuts and that's kind of starting to get fully absorbed in the market. And so that was one. And also, we saw the dislocation and the repo markets subside. So we've seen some bottoming of the kind of spread decline happen over the last couple of quarters. And as we said, we think that's a pretty good run rate for the near term. In terms of -- in terms of turnover in this particular RIS book, I don't think we have that handy here. But again, you can talk to IR off-line. It's -- we talk about overall this -- the roll-off reinvest with regards to rate for the firm. A lot of that, obviously, mix matters there, and it's hard to read into that specifically. But I think just -- I would go back to what we've said, which is that the spreads here have started to bottom. You see the benefit of 2 full rate cuts. You can see that in our crediting rate. It's kind of dropped faster than our investment yield in this business, and that's because we have a lot of floating rate liabilities in that business. And it does take some time for that to fully get recognized because 3-month LIBOR does -- it has to take a little -- a few months before it's fully recognized there. So I'll let Steve add some color.
Steven Goulart: I'll just add a little bit of color, Steve Goulart, Andrew. But just reminding you of our capital markets business, which I think is where you're going with that question. In general, it is a shorter duration business, and there isn't a lot of mismatch. So even when there's rollover on the asset side, we're also managing rollover on the liability side. So it's a reasonably matched business, and that protects us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question, it seems like there were some good PRT momentum to end the year. If you could just give us a little bit of an update on the sales pipeline? And what you're seeing with that business? And I guess, interest rates went up in the fourth quarter, and then they've been down this year. Is that -- have you seen any impact from interest rates on the pipeline there?
Ramy Tadros: Good morning, Elyse. It's Ramy here. We're clearly very pleased with our PRT results, both for the quarter and for the year. The quarter was a $2.5 billion quarter, and as Michel mentioned, it's a $4.3 billion a year for us. Remember, we're focusing -- from a pipeline perspective, we are focusing on the larger end of the market. So these are big pension plans, mid-single digits, but sometimes even higher with respect to the size of these plans. That's the part of the market where we have a competitive advantage with respect to our rating, our investment capability and our scale of the balance sheet. And when you think about those plans, they are on a derisking journey, right? So this is not something that's a trade that they make overnight. And that -- this derisking journey ends up taking a number of years. And therefore, for any one of them, the current rate position is only an input because it depends on their overall ALM position and it depends on their equity allocation. So having said all of that and given the market we're focused on, we're still seeing a very robust 2020 in that segment that we're looking at.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my next question, within your P&C business, you guys called out higher BI severity trends in the quarter, impacting both current accident year as well as prior accident years. If you could just give a little bit more color on what you're seeing? And as you think of 2020, does getting within your guide assume that the severity trends might remain elevated at least for part of this year?
Ramy Tadros: Sure. So clearly, it's been a challenging quarter for the P&C business. And the headline here, as you've mentioned, is a bodily injury severity. And as you know, it's a trend that we're seeing in the marketplace. We saw some initial indication of deterioration in the third quarter, and we took some reserve strengthening then. And those indications worsened in the fourth quarter, which warranted additional strengthening. And that's a combination of PYDs as well as out-of-period strengthening for '19. As we look forward, I can tell you, we're looking at these trends very closely. We're pulling a range of levers, which are at our disposal, beginning with rate actions where we've accelerated some of the rate actions into early 2020, but we're also looking at underwriting and claims practices. So we're on top of this. I could say with respect to the auto line, in particular, where we stand today, our expectations are that we would remain within our overall guidance range for auto, albeit towards the upper end of that range. So if you recall, that's a 93% to 98% for the auto business.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And John, one just quick numbers question. The derivative loss in the quarter, you said that, that was driven off of the move in interest rates. Given that interest rates have been down to start 2020, should we think about that reversing in the first quarter this year?
John McCallion: Yes, directionally correct. Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from ISI.
Thomas Gallagher: Just one follow-up on property casualty. The current accident year auto loss ratio was 82%. And I guess, the question is, is that a just 4Q pick? Or is that a current accident year catch-up for the prior quarters as well? Like what would a better trend loss ratio be? Because I assume it's not a 107 combined as the way we should think about normalized heading into 2020?
Ramy Tadros: Yes. I mean, if you look at the fourth quarter, if you exclude the PYDs in the quarter, I would say, remember, that the fourth quarter is typically seasonally higher for auto for us. So if you think about that fourth quarter results, excluding PYD, it's 98.9%. And again, there's some elevation because of seasonality here.
Thomas Gallagher: Got you. And then just a question on capital management. So buybacks were lighter this quarter and your buildup of cash at the holding company is now $4.2 billion. So that's slightly above your target for the first time in a while. Any reason why you dialed it back this quarter despite having the excess cash to use?
Michel Khalaf: Yes, Tom, it's Michel. As we mentioned, we are comfortable with the $3 billion to $4 billion buffer at the HoldCo, slightly above this -- for the fourth quarter. Mostly, I would say, timing related in terms of dividends to the HoldCo. I would look at our sort of cash buyback activity in the fourth quarter in tandem with the third quarter. We had mentioned then that we had pulled forward some of the share repurchases. We tend to be opportunistic in that respect. So nothing more to read into that, I would say.
Thomas Gallagher: And Michel, just as a follow-up, are you -- how are you thinking right now in terms of the balance or trade-off between M&A and buybacks?
Michel Khalaf: No change also in terms of our capital management philosophy. I think we talked before about M&A opportunities, how we view those strategic fit accretive. And we sort of also consider alternative uses of capital. So I would say no change in terms of our capital management philosophy. Excess capital belongs to the shareholders, and absent M&A activity, we'll return it in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.
Jamminder Bhullar: I just had a question first on what you're seeing in terms of the operating environment in the Latin America business, and specifically, in Chile, where your sales were weak this quarter. There's also a lot of talk about political uncertainty and potential changes in the pension business.
Oscar Schmidt: Yes, Jimmy, this is Oscar. So let me start with the social situation. As I said in December, the magnitude of the profits was a surprise to everybody. But I have to say it's getting better. And remember that, in summer, in Chile, the flow activity, January and February, we'll need to see what happens in March when the year really starts there. But so far, the social environment has been much better. In terms of the business, to-date, we have not seen a significant impact on our business through January from the situation there. But facts and circumstances may change, of course, as the situation evolves. So let me talk about the reform, which, I think, is your other question. The government finally managed to present a project in the Congress for pension reform, and they were able to make it to be approved in the house, in the lower chamber. Now it has to go to the Senate. February is -- there's no Congress activity. So we need to wait until March to see what happens in the Senate. I have to say, it's too early to say in the legislative process to -- what's going to happen. It's possible that there will be more changes, right, to be introduced before the project ends up enacted as a law. But we cannot say what is the final impact. But based on the facts, not today, which is the version of the project that is being discussed, we don't anticipate material financial impact to the region. It's -- I would say, it's a good step forward for the people of Chile in terms of the kind of pension improvements that introduces, and hopefully, will help to ease the social situation there if the project is approved. So we really support the government pension reform efforts. I hope that answers your question?
Jamminder Bhullar: And the potential impact on your business as of the proposal as you see it currently?
Oscar Schmidt: As it stands today, it's not big, right? Now I have to say we've got to be prudent because we don't know how it's going to end. It still has to go through senate and the executive power has to approve it, but the version that is being discussed today, we think it's good for people, and the impact on our business is not that big.
Jamminder Bhullar: Okay. And then if I could ask one more of John McCallion. Just on the changes in accounting that are coming through in 2022 on long duration contracts, you haven't disclosed any sort of potential impact on your business either as anybody else. Are you expecting to start quantifying more of the impact in the next few quarters? Or would you wait until your even closer to the rules being implemented, so maybe next year?
John McCallion: Yes, hard to tell in terms of time line at this point. We're still working through it. So we don't really have a projected or estimated time line in terms of when we would share that information.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW.
Ryan Krueger: [Technical Difficulty]. Just from reinsurers on pieces of MetLife Holdings at the December Investor Day. Can you give an update on that? And are you still seeing the same amount of interest following the decline in interest rates this year?
John McCallion: Ryan, at the beginning of your question, you cut off, but I think it had to do with just any updates on just activity from reinsurers with regards to holdings, is that right?
Ryan Krueger: That's right. And have you seen any impact from lower interest rates as well?
John McCallion: Yes. I would actually maybe refer to the way that Ramy described PRTs. It's not something that they can turn on, turn off. This is like -- given the size and the complexity, sometimes it just requires people to spend time on these things for some time. So I don't think they react to movements in interest rates as much. So I would say it's no change at this point. It's -- there's still kind of a good supply of capital out there, but I'd say the bid-ask spread is still fairly wide, but there's a number of folks that have entered the space over the last few years, and we're seeing that.
Ryan Krueger: And then on the expenses, there was a lot of seasonality, I guess, in 2019. Can you give us any sense of, I guess, how to think about normal seasonality with the direct expense ratio?
John McCallion: Yes, I will try. And I make that point only because we have talked about that there is seasonality from quarter-to-quarter, which is why we focus on the annual direct expense ratio. Having said that, let me just kind of recall a few things. So we did say that -- and we've called out previously that the third and fourth quarter tend to be -- tend to be elevated due to the cost, as I mentioned, in my opening remarks for the enrollment of group customers, and we don't get those premiums in until the following year, so this tends to be an elevated. And even this year, if you recall, we didn't see that come through in the third quarter. So there was even some slippage into 4Q. On top of that seasonality, there were some additional onetime costs in the quarter that we would not expect to recur. We had some elevated employee benefit costs. Remember in the earlier 3 quarters, we had employee benefit costs going the other way. So they've kind of washed or kind of neutralized each other out. And then we also had some additional corporate initiatives spend in the quarter, in 4Q, that was elevated. So we estimate 50 to 60 basis points above what normal trend would be for kind of the fourth quarter. And so you can kind of think of that as what we had expected in the quarter and the additional onetime costs that came through.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.
Humphrey Lee: Just want to follow up on that expense. So -- but looking back specifically in group benefits, just looking back, I don't really see there's a seasonality that you talked about in 3Q and 4Q. And then, obviously, this year, we see the bonds of it in the fourth quarter. So I was just wondering, is there anything constructionally different this year compared to years past?
Ramy Tadros: Well, remember also, I mean, we've been growing a lot, right, in the last few years. So you're seeing there is kind of a pickup as a result of just sheer growth, but I would say that's the case. We can -- we'll look again, but it's there. And there's other things that go into this, right? I mean, there's other investments being made. So sometimes, it's hard. But as we've said -- and I think, last year, there might have been employee benefit costs that offset that. So the volatility and some of the market impacts from unemployed benefit costs can impact the segments as well. So you might see a little offset, but you can be assured, it's in there.
Humphrey Lee: Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up question on the tax rate. So I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about the effective tax rate was 18.5%. I'm a little bit struggling to get to that number based on the tax items that you called out. I think you may have some additional tax items, too, but maybe if you can help me to think about like the tax rate, what contributed to the reported number and then versus your effective tax rate?
John McCallion: Yes. I think if you -- so if you adjust the notable items, you come to something closer in the 13s in terms of effective tax rate. So we did have some additional positive items that were not called out as notable just because of the size and, call it, our kind of approach to notables of anything over a $50 million impact. So it's a series of a few items. One is there were some revision to the rules on the GILTI tax in the fourth quarter, and I think it was early December, maybe late November, which ultimately provided a company's ability to use some additional foreign tax credits. So that came through in the fourth quarter. And then the remaining amount is effectively just some return to provision true-ups and some other year-end tax estimate refinements. So if you exclude those items, it's, call it, $65 million impact, you get to 18.5%. And so that's how you reconcile the quarter ETR.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Barnidge from Piper Sandler.
John Barnidge: Sorry. I was muted. Have you seen any change in the operating environment in EMEA following the favorable U.K. election and subsequent Brexit certainty?
Michel Khalaf: Yes, John, I would say not much. I mean, our business in the U.K. as mostly employee benefits and individual protection. So I wouldn't say that we've seen a major -- there's an improvement in the overall sentiment, I would say, post-elections and now with Brexit sort of not necessarily behind the U.K. but at least decided. But no impact to our business that I would call out, no.
John Barnidge: Okay. And then kind of back to the auto adverse development, were there specific states this came from? And what levels of rate are you going to push to correct this, specifically within auto?
John McCallion: Yes. I mean, we -- there are clearly some skew there, and there are some states where we see -- where we saw higher severity than others. So there is that skew there, and we're clearly focusing on the states where we're writing the most amount of business. In terms of rate taking, so if you look at over 2019, we took 2% in rate across the book on average. Over the last 90 days, we've accelerated the rate actions for 2020. So we've taken under 2% in rate, just for Q1 of 2020, and we're clearly going to be watching this carefully. We expect to take additional rate as warranted.
Operator: And I'd now like to turn the call back to Michel Khalaf for any closing comments.
Michel Khalaf: So let me close this meeting by thanking everyone for joining us. We're pleased with our strong 2019 results and our growing track record of consistent performance. Having said that, rest assured that this leadership team is motivated by a strong sense of urgency to create greater shareholder value. Thank you again, and talk to you soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-31 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note on the forward-looking statements in yesterday’s earnings release.  With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2019 earnings call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and in our quarterly financial supplements which you should review. Joining me this morning on the call are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released an expanded set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. The content for the slides begins following the romanette pages that feature a number of GAAP reconciliations. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John and good morning everyone. There is a growing sense of urgency and excitement at MetLife. We are renewing our commitment to being a purpose-driven company. We are making good progress on a strategy that defines the right markets, solutions, and competitive differentiators and we are building a culture that is customer-focused and highly collaborative. I am confident we are assembling all the right ingredients to win in the marketplace and create long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to our third quarter results, MetLife delivered solid earnings despite a challenging capital markets environment marked by falling interest rates. We continue to build a company that can perform well across economic cycles. As we reported last night, net income totaled $2.2 billion, up from $880 million in the third quarter of 2018. This result mainly reflected the impact of declining interest rates on our derivative portfolio as accounting rules require us to mark our hedges to market through the income statement but not the assets or liabilities being hedged. Quarterly adjusted earnings totaled $1.2 billion or $1.27 per share compared with $1.4 billion or $1.38 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Excluding all notable items, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.54 per share compared with $1.5 billion or $1.53 per share a year ago. Our adjusted return on equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA and ex-notables, was 12.9% and MetLife's book value per share as noted in our press release was up 13% to $48.56 from a year ago. During the third quarter, we completed our annual actuarial assumption review which John McCallion will discuss in greater detail. As part of the review, MetLife changed its long-term interest rate assumption from 4.25% to 3.75%. Along with other insurance adjustments, the impact of the actuarial review on adjusted earnings was negative $160 million with an incremental $19 million effect on net income. The overall results were in line with our expectations and with the disclosures we provided to you on our second quarter call. We believe this reflects our progress in becoming a simpler company, that derives more of its earnings from protection and capital-light businesses. Excluding just the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, which is on a basis consistent with the consensus estimate, adjusted earnings were $1.44 per share. Market conditions in the third quarter were mixed. While lower recurring investment margins and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on adjusted earnings, MetLife also benefited from higher variable investment income driven by strong private equity performance. Investments is an area where MetLife enjoys longstanding advantages. The size of our portfolio coupled with the capabilities of our investment team allow us to differentiate through higher-yielding, private placements, commercial mortgages and private equities, all of which have generated significant alpha across economic cycles. Moving to specific third quarter business highlights. Our market-leading U.S. group business reported strong results. The drivers were volume growth, especially sales of voluntary benefits as well as favorable expense margins and solid underwriting. Our U.S. group business has longstanding strategic partnerships, some of which date back a century. Today, it offers the widest range of employee benefits products anywhere in the industry. This helps our customers meet the ever-evolving needs and expectations of their current and potential employees. In short, we help win the war for talent. In addition, the size and scale of the business make it easier for us to invest in enrollment technology, claims management and privacy protection. This fuels a virtuous cycle that allows us to strengthen our relationships with customers while preserving and extending our advantages. We are the leading player in the large market segment with over 25% market share and we see further growth through greater voluntary product penetration. We are also extending our reach into the regional and small markets, where we believe our competitive advantages provide the same opportunity to drive growth and market share. Turning to our other MetLife businesses, excluding notable items, adjusted earnings in our Retirement and Income Solutions business were down compared with a very strong third quarter of 2018 despite good volume growth and pension risk transfer sales. This quarter, lower interest and underwriting margins had a negative impact. In our Property & Casualty business, adjusted earnings were down compared with a strong third quarter a year ago, driven mainly by higher cat losses and lower underlying underwriting margins. In our Asia business, strong volume growth and higher variable investment income drove an increase in adjusted earnings more than offsetting the effects of a strong U.S. dollar. Our Latin America business benefited from volume growth and equity market performance while facing headwinds from tax items, recurring investment margins and foreign exchange pressures. In our EMEA business, lower underwriting margins and higher taxes offset volume growth and favorable expense margins. Finally, while adjusted earnings were down in MetLife Holdings, the performance of that business is firmly within our expected range for the year. Moving to expenses, excluding notable items and pension risk transfers, our direct expense ratio for the third quarter was 12.2% compared with 13.1% a year ago. This was driven by favorable items related to the market impact on employee benefits costs revenue growth and continued discipline around expenses. We remain on-track to deliver $800 million in margin expansion by 2020 as promised. Over the longer term, we intend to achieve greater economies of scale. We have made significant progress on this front opening multiple centers of excellence here in the U.S. and around the world that lower costs, improve controls and drive down development. Overall, we are shifting from one-off cost initiatives to a continuous efficiency mindset where we will drive savings and greater efficiency to support continued investment and growth. Capital deployment is one of the most critical and carefully considered decisions, we make at MetLife. We are committed to deploying capital, where it will generate the highest risk-adjusted returns. This means, exercising the same discipline across all potential uses of capital, whether to underwrite organic growth, support in-force business, finance M&A, all fund common dividends and share repurchases. With a volatile third quarter equity market, we opportunistically push forward some of our planned annual share buyback activity for the year. In total, we repurchased $785 million of MetLife shares in the quarter. During the first three quarters of 2019 combined, we returned more than $3.2 billion to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases. In closing, we are pleased to deliver another good quarter, the latest installment in our improving track record of consistent execution. We have a collection of great businesses and clear advantages that we believe will continue to set us apart. I am encouraged by our progress and look forward to sharing more about our next horizon strategy and our businesses at MetLife's upcoming Investor Day on December 12.  With that I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our third quarter performance in greater detail. 
John McCallion: Thank you Michel, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 3Q, 2019 supplemental slides that we released last evening along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. Starting on Page 4, the schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the third quarter of 2019. Net income was $2.2 billion or $962 million higher than adjusted earnings of $1.2 billion. This variance is primarily due to higher net derivative gains resulting from the decline in interest rates during the quarter. Overall the results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. I will now discuss the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review starting on Page 5. During the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments reduced net income by $179 million of which $160 million impacted adjusted earnings. The most significant driver was the reduction of our long-term U.S. 10-year treasury interest rate assumption from 4.25% to 3.75% with the rate mean reverting over the next 8 years. This impact was in line with our prior guidance of $50 million after-tax for every 25 basis point reduction disclosed on our second quarter 2019 earnings call. With regards to long-term care, our statutory reserves have grown to $15.6 billion as of September 30, 2019, which is $2.7 billion higher than GAAP reserves. We also continue to have substantial LTC loss recognition testing margin of $1.8 billion as of September 30, 2019 which compares to $2.1 billion at 3Q, 2018. Roughly half of the decrease was due to an approximate 10 basis point reduction in our average lapsed rate assumption, while the remainder was due to the change in our U.S. 10-year treasury mean reversion rate. The impact from these changes was broadly in line with the sensitivities we provided a year ago on our 3Q, 2018 earnings call. On page six we provide a breakdown of the actuarial assumption review by business segment. In MetLife Holdings, approximately $100 million of the net income impact was due to the lowering of the mean reversion interest rate to 3.75%, with the remaining impact driven primarily by refinements in assumptions related to our regulatory closed block. We also had a few minor adjustments outside the U.S. in Asia, LatAm and EMEA. We had two notable items in the quarter as shown on page seven and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition to the $160 million after-tax, or $0.17 per share, related to our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $88 million after tax, or $0.09 per share. Adjusted earnings excluding both notable items were $1.4 billion, or $1.54 per share. On page eight, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings, excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were down 6% and down 5% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 1% on both a reported and a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include solid volume growth and better expense margins. Investment margins were mixed, as continued strength in variable investment income was offset by lower recurring interest margins. In addition, underwriting was generally less favorable relative to a very strong 3Q 2018. With regards to business performance, Group Benefits adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 10% year-over-year, driven by volume growth and better expense margins. The business continues to benefit from strong volume growth with adjusted PFOs in the quarter up 6% and year-to-date sales up 10%, led by growth in voluntary products across all market segments. In addition, we saw solid underwriting in the quarter. Group Life mortality ratio was 87%, which is modestly below the mid-point of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Although, this was less favorable compared to a very strong result of 85% in 3Q, 2018. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 70.3%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and favorable to the prior year quarter of 71.6%, after excluding a notable insurance adjustment. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from renewal rate actions and higher claim recoveries. Retirement and Income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 16% year-over-year. The key drivers were lower investment margins as weaker recurring interest regions exceeded the positive contribution from variable investment income and less favorable underwriting margins. This was partially offset by favorable expense margins. RIS investment spreads were 102 basis points in 3Q 2019, down 23 basis points year-over-year and down 17 basis points sequentially. Strong private equity returns were more than offset by the ongoing pressure from low rates and the inverted yield curve as well as the recent dislocation in the repo market during the quarter. We continue to expect spreads to remain in the bottom half of our 2019 guidance range of 100 to 125 basis points. RIS adjusted PFOs were up 13% year-over-year, driven by $1.3 billion of pension risk transfer deals in 3Q 2019. Excluding PRTs, RIS PFOs were down 9% due to lower sales of institutional income annuities. Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were down 34%, primarily due to unfavorable underwriting in the quarter. The auto combined ratio was 98.7%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 95.5%, primarily due to higher vitally injury severity. In addition, pretax cat losses of $70 million were $21 million higher than the prior year quarter, but in line with our expected 3Q 2019 cat load. While underwriting results were unfavorable this quarter, we expect our full year 2019 combined ratios for auto and home to be within their targeted range. With regards to the topline, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 2%, while sales were down 4% versus 3Q 2018. Asia adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 5% and up 6% on a constant currency basis. The positive year-over-year drivers were favorable volume growth as assets under management, excluding fair value adjustments, grew 13% year-over-year. In addition, results also reflected better investment margins and lower taxes. These were partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins. Asia sales were down 7% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of the divested business in Hong Kong and a large group case in Australia in the prior year quarter, Asia sales were up 1% year-over-year. In Japan, sales were down 15%, primarily driven by a 32% year-over-year decline in foreign currency-denominated annuity products. FX annuity products, which are primarily sold through bank channels, had another soft quarter given the further drop in U.S. interest rates. This resulted in an overall reduction in bank market sales. In addition, our A&H sales in Japan were down 15% year-over-year, which is a function of changes in the tax laws associated with certain products. Other Asia sales were up 7% due to strong growth in Korea, China, and India. Latin America adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 2% and 7% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were the favorable impact from capital markets on our Chilean encaje and volume growth across the region. These were partially offset by lower investment margins, primarily due to lower inflation in Mexico and Chile. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 4% and 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. Latin America sales were up 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher sales in Chile, Mexico and Brazil. EMEA adjusted earnings excluding notable items were down 15% and down 13% on a constant currency basis. The main drivers were less favorable underwriting, primarily related to employee benefits in the U.K. and the Gulf as well as higher taxes. These were partially offset by favorable expense margins. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 6% on a constant currency basis and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings excluding notable items were down 18%, driven by lower recurring interest margins and the impact of $30 million of favorable items in 3Q, 2018. These were partially offset by favorable expense margins. With regard to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 67.5% but 51.9% excluding the impact from the annual actuarial assumption review. While this ratio is higher than the prior year quarter of 50.9% on the same basis, it was firmly within our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss excluding notable items was $135 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $149 million due to lower taxes and interest expense on debt. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins. The company’s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 17.6%, which was aided by increased tax-exempt income and the timing of some tax benefits in Argentina. We would view the run rate to be 18.8% and within our 2019 guidance of 18% to 20%. Now let's turn to page 9 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the past seven quarters, including $326 million earned in the current quarter. Our private equity portfolio, which is accounted for on a one quarter lag had another strong quarter. For the year-to-date, VII was $834 million pre-tax and we now expect to be above our 2019 guidance range of $800 million to $1 billion. Now, I will discuss recurring investment income. Our new money rate was 3.65% versus a roll-off rate of 4.19% in 3Q, 2019. This compares to a new money rate of 4.04% and a roll-off rate of 4.37% in 3Q, 2018. Lower interest rates have pressured the spread. As we have noted previously, we would not expect parity to occur until we have a sustained U.S. 10-year treasury yield of roughly 3% to 3.25%. Turning to page 10. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2018, as well as the first three quarters of 2019. We are committed to and have a clear line of sight towards achieving our goal of $800 million of pre-tax profit margin improvement by 2020. This would represent an approximate 200 basis point decline in our annual direct expense ratio from 2015 baseline year. We believe the annual direct expense ratio best reflects the impact on profit margins as it captures the relationship of revenues and the expenses over which we have the most control. We have made consistent progress towards achieving our target by 2020. As the chart illustrates, we have already achieved 140-basis point improvement in the annual direct expense ratio from 2015 to 2018. For 3Q 2019, we posted another strong result as the direct expense ratio excluding notable items and PRTs came in at 12.2%. This was aided by roughly 30 basis of favorable items including lower employee benefit costs related to market movements in the third quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher than our 2019 year-to-date trend. This is a function of the strong growth we have enjoyed in our Group Benefits business where we will incur seasonal enrollment and other costs prior to receiving associated premiums. In addition we estimate costs associated with our unit cost initiative to be a few cents per share higher in the fourth quarter as we execute on the final elements of this program. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $3.5 billion at September 30th, which is down from $4.2 billion at June 30th. Holdco cash decreased this quarter given the timing of subsidiary dividends and our capital management actions. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and common dividends in the quarter, clear evidence of our ongoing commitment to capital management. Next, I would like to provide you an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2019 statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.4 billion and net earnings were approximately $3 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $195 million from the prior year period, primarily due to the impact of a prior year dividend from the investment subsidiary, partially offset by lower VA rider reserves and improved underwriting results. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $20 billion as of September 30th, 2019, up 9% compared to December 31st, 2018. The increase in operating earnings and derivative gains were partially offset by dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 896% as of June 30th, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife continued to deliver strong results leveraging our diverse market-leading businesses to drive capital-efficient growth, while maintaining expense discipline across the firm. We have been able to grow book value per share 13% year-over-year, while generating an adjusted ROE of 12.9% excluding notable items in the quarter, despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. In addition our cash and capital position as well as our balance sheet remains strong and resilient. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So, I had a question on group insurance margins and if you could just discuss what drove your strong results this quarter? And then also relatedly, everyone's had pretty good margins in the last couple of years now, so have you seen companies start to reflect that in their pricing? And what have you seen as you're going through renewal season right now?
Ramy Tadros: Good morning, Jimmy. It's Ramy Tadros here. In terms of the margins this quarter and if you look at the year-on-year comparisons with respect to life, we're actually slightly up between this year and last year. We came in at 87% and slightly higher -- lower than our midpoint. And what drove the difference quarter-to-quarter -- quarter-on-quarter is the higher incidence. With respect to the Non-Medical Health loss ratio, clearly that was below the low end of our guidance. And that's largely driven by the lower claim sensitivity -- severity rather with respect to disability and higher recoveries. Look -- if you look at these ratios, they do fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. And we would expect generally to come in towards the middle range -- the middle part of our range. Having said that, I would emphasize that if you look at it year-to-date -- our year-to-date numbers in mortality -- if you look at last year for example, our year-to-date numbers for mortality came in -- we were below the bottom half of our range. And you looked at Q4 and we came in, smack in the middle of that range. So if you think about the competitive environment, we still operate in a highly competitive environment. But when we look towards 2020, we're pleased with our rate actions and we're pleased with our renewal actions as well.
Michel Khalaf: Maybe -- hi, Jimmy its Michel. Maybe I just would add one comment with regards to Non-Medical Health, which is coming in favorable and below the -- sort of in the lower half of the range, which we think will continue for the year. And that's a combination of the favorable disability experience as well as the shift in product mix to voluntary, which has a lower benefit ratio and that we continue to see strong momentum in voluntary, and we think that will persist and continue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Good morning. A couple of quick ones for you. Is there – John, is there any go-forward earnings impact from the actuarial review, is my first one. Second one is just, can you discuss how well hedged? Or to what degree you have hedges for your long-term care cash flows? 
John McCallion: Good morning, Tom.
Tom Gallagher: …thanks.
John McCallion: Yeah. You broke up there. I think I got it. The first one, I think the quick answer is no. First, I think 100 of the 160 was right in line with what we shared back in 2Q with regards to the drop in long-term interest rate. So that came in as expected. And then we had a variety of other items and it was mainly the regulatory closed block that drove the remainder there. In terms of long-term care, we do have some quite a bit of hedges on. And actually I'd say, we've locked in kind of the investment returns for the next five years or so. We have a number of forward starting instruments that we've entered into over time. So we're kind of protected for the next five years. And obviously, we have hedges beyond that. But rollover reinvestment risk would persist beyond that.
Tom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Crédit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning. First question, Ramy could you elaborate on what you were saying about pleased about renewal actions. Could you give us a sense of maybe pricing? Is it up in group? Is it flat? What made you pleased?
Ramy Tadros: Good morning, Andrew. I mean, look if you think about by way of context as we just look into 2020, when we think of our business, we look at overall growth in the business across both renewals as well as sales. So sales are an important component of that growth but we also focus very heavily on renewals in getting our rate actions combined with strong persistency. We're still in the midst of our 2020 sales and renewal season. It's more mature for national account less earlier in the season for regional and smaller accounts. But with respect to national account activity, strong quote activity. We're still winning our fair share. We're seeing less of the jumbos come to market and we're defining jumbos as sales over $20 million. And we have expectations in terms of targets, in terms of renewal rates and sales and so far so good, where we're actually in line with our expectations. And we also continue to see strong momentum in voluntary, as Michel mentioned, and we continue to deploy new capabilities in the market, especially around enrollment and reenrollment in the voluntary space.
Andrew Kligerman: Okay. So -- all right. Well, as I go through the next question maybe Ramy you could just say up or down on pricing or neutral. But the next question would be with regard to capital. So you've guided to a 65% to 75% payout ratio. And last quarter the payout ratio was 88%. This year – this quarter it was 100%. You're kind of at the midpoint of your liquidity at the parent company. So the question is, can you keep this payout ratio well above your guidance. And maybe you could give some color on redeployable capital at the subs in addition to what you have at the parent?
John McCallion: Good morning, Andrew. It's John. Let's just to kind of level set. I'd say our guidance has been a 65% to 75% free cash flow ratio on average over a two year period. And obviously, in any quarter that can fluctuate one way or the other. In terms of – and what we've said in the past is without barring other strategic investments that would meet risk-adjusted returns that we believe would be appropriate, this capital in our minds belong to the shareholders. And Michel has talked about that quite a bit. And so all else equal, that would be used for dividends and share repurchases. But to your point, I think Michel commented that in his opening remarks, we have accelerated a bit of that this year. I wouldn't consider this a run rate. And I think as Michel mentioned, we probably pulled -- we're opportunistic this quarter and given timing of cash flows and things like that.
Andrew Kligerman: So there's capital in the subs as well that might be re-deployable? Curious if there are any numbers you could give us?
John McCallion: Well, we have -- we've talked about our normal operating level and a minimum of 360% under an NAIC RBC ratio for the combined U.S. entities. Last year, we were above that. But I'd say I think about our 65 to 75 on average for a two-year period is the right number and it can be -- it can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. And then I referenced Michel's comments earlier that we were opportunistic this quarter and we accelerated some of the share repurchases in the quarter given market dynamics and timing of cash flows.
Andrew Kligerman: Got it. And just a quick up/down from Ramy on the pricing in group?
Ramy Tadros: I would say in line.
Andrew Kligerman: In line. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. Just first on statutory results. John, any thoughts on AAT reserves as you go into the year-end filing?
John McCallion: Not at the moment. We're working through the process now. It's that time of the year and I don't -- there's nothing concerning at this point. We're just going through the process.
Suneet Kamath: Got it. And then on the RIS spread, I think you said still feel comfortable with the lower half of the 100 to 125 guide. Was that for the fourth quarter? Or was that sort of a full year expectation?
John McCallion: Yes. So, my commentary is regarding full year and we've talked about this guidance as a full year guidance. So, we said we'd be within the 100 to 125, albeit at the bottom half of the range. And maybe just a little additional color because it's a good question. I think -- look, sequentially we're down about 17 basis points, 12 of that was in RIS which is the allocation of VII. They had actually a pretty high VII allocation in the second quarter. And then the remaining drop was the function of just lower rates and the inversion of the curve as well as I mentioned just a little bit of the dislocation we saw in the repo market. But as we look forward and the projected forward curve does support a view that we're -- we believe we're at the bottom of the spread compression or near it, let's say, and at least for the near-term and maybe you say next several quarters. And so maybe in other words to look at this you'd say that this spread is a decent run rate in our mind. And we think of that as VII which has been a heavy contributor probably normalizes some and we see an improvement at least based on the forward curve in the spread ex-VII over the next several quarters.
Suneet Kamath: Great. Thanks John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Outside of the few cents of higher expense initiative costs in the fourth quarter, can you help us think about the potential sizing of typical seasonality in the direct expense ratio for 4Q?
John McCallion: Hard to estimate exactly from a sizing perspective, but we do typically see it happen in the third and fourth. I’d say, we did not see it come through yet in the third. So we do expect there to be an uptick in the fourth quarter on that direct expense ratio as you said ex the UCI onetime time costs. It's not so predictable. It depends on some of the marketing costs that we deploy in our enrollment capabilities there, as we move through enrollment season and so it can vary. But I'd say, there's an upward trend and probably as I said heading -- it's ahead of what we've seen certainly year-to-date without question.
Ryan Krueger: Okay. Got it. And then on P&C, can you give a little bit more color on what you saw in the underlying loss ratio? And to what extent do you think it may remain somewhat elevated near term? 
Michel Khalaf: Yes. I mean, if you look at the year-on-year results with respect to P&C, I would say the drop is 50:50. We've had a -- 50% of the drop was due to the elevated cat losses this quarter. I'd remind you should compare that as -- compared to a fairly benign Q3 of 2018. But the losses this quarter were very much inline with our expectations for third quarter. The other 50% of it is the higher severity in the auto liability coverages and particularly bodily injury cranes. This has been consistent with what many others have seen in the industry we continue to monitor these trends and we have a track record of adjusting our rate activity accordingly and looking to take rate actions to make sure we continue to remain within our target combined ratios. 
Ryan Krueger: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Hi. Thank you. Just curious how is low interest rate environment affecting product demand and new business margins in the RIS business? 
Michel Khalaf: Hi Erik. So the place where we felt it a bit this quarter is in the immediate annuity sales. We are the largest seller of the institutional income annuities and we've seen some softness in terms of sales this quarter. As the rates come down the value proposition for the individual buying those annuities decreases clearly. So we've seen some softness there in terms of sales. In terms of PRT haven't seen it. We still are looking at a very robust pipeline into the rest of the year and into next year and in particular in the jumbo space where we are most active. Clearly of course, if you look at our liability balances in RIS lower interest rates actually grow these balances, if you think about the mark-to-market effect on the fixed income balances there. 
Erik Bass: Got it. Thank you. And then one question on investments, in your alternatives portfolio, you talked about continued good performance, some private equity, like one that your competitors had and issue with mark down on a specific position. So just wondering, how much exposure you have to large single company positions, either in public or private securities? 
Steve Goulart: Well like our -- its Steve Goulart. Like our overall investment portfolio, it is broad and diversified. Recall our private equity portfolio is over $6.5 billion across dozens of different managers and more than that in funds. So it's fairly diversified. Obviously some managers may invest in similar investments. But we're scratching our head a little bit too and we can't figure out what might have happened in one of our competitors. We're certainly aware of nothing in our portfolio that would cause an action like that today.
Erik Bass: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Lee: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Looking at sales in Japan, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about some of the moving pieces. But given the ongoing low interest rate, and I guess the uncertainty of some of the tax regulation, how should we think about the sales in Japan going into the fourth quarter, and I guess going into 2020?
Kishore Ponnavolu: Yeah, Humphrey this is Kishore Ponnavolu. There are two parts to this, right? One is the annuities that John referenced vis-à-vis the bank channel. Of all the channels we have that's probably the most volatile ups and downs. So we've had a couple of high watermarks in the past four quarters. So the year-over-year comparisons are going to be somewhat challenging for the next two to three quarters as far as the annuities are concerned. When you think about the -- John referenced the interest rate is one driver. There are couple of other drivers as well. Seasonality is another driver and what's going on with the -- mutual fund sales is another driver. But the reality is the overall market is down and we're holding our share. And we'll go up and down with the market. And what we won't do is chase after market share by giving up value. Vis-à-vis, the A&H side, as you're very well aware of the tax law clarification and changes and that has impacted some of our products, we withdrew a product in the second quarter. So essentially if you take that effect out, our A&H sales are actually up year-over-year. It's going to take some time to make up for a lost product and the lost sales associated with the product. But the fact is as Michel referenced, we're very proud to be very customer-centric and to take actions that are appropriate, that are the right things for the customer. And there are a lot of actions that we have in place to come back up. But two to three quarters year-on-year comparisons again are going to be a little challenging, but we'll make up. There are a lot of other tools in our arsenal. Thank you.
Humphrey Lee: I appreciate the color. Just to revisit back on the Group Benefits margin. Like -- looking at the earnings growth, I think you were guided -- you're guiding for mid-single-digit growth for 2019 and year-to-date at 25%. Like while we understand that there is definitely favorable underwriting in the industry, but the magnitude definitely outpaces the rest of the industry. Like I guess, what do you think if the driver for your block strong performance compared to your peers? And how sustainable is that?
Michel Khalaf: Yeah. I mean if you just look at the overall earnings number, it's driven by three things. The solid underwriting results is one of them, and you saw us coming with strong underwriting results, but there are two other components to it. We've had also strong volume growth especially in voluntary. And we've also had favorable expense margins including positive market impact on some of our employee costs in the Group Benefits business. So it's a combination of the three. I would still continue to guide you back to those ranges and to the midpoint of those ranges. We do operate in a competitive market. And over time, we expect to be back in the middle of those underwriting ratios that we look at.
Humphrey Lee: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, when you guys had your outlook last year there was a stress sensitivity for interest rates that suggested about $200 million for 2020. So I'd just be interested if there's any action you've taken this year that would have changed that at all. Because, I mean, just looking at distressed scenario, it does look like we're about there or maybe even a little worse than the stress case that you outlined, so any color? And I guess additionally, how much of that $200 million would maybe already be in the result at sort of the 144 EPS that was reported? 
John McCallion: Good morning, Alex. It's John. Yes, we did give a sensitivity back in the outlook call. We showed a 100 basis point parallel shift in the curve from rates projected to based on the forward curve at that time. And as you said, we are well below that. I think the 10-year is probably down more like 150 and also wasn't parallel. We had a LIBOR drop of maybe 100 or so. So the dynamics are a little different in that sensitivity. I think in general, I'd say that we feel that sensitivity was broadly in line but we've had some additional pressures come through that are in the numbers. For example, as we've mentioned before, SEC lending has not performed as well as it has in the past. It's still ROE-accretive and a good tool for us but maybe not as profitable of a tool as it has been in the past, which is a good reason to have a diversified book of market-leading businesses, right and to kind of have that at different times when we need it. So I'd say that the impact of interest rates has probably been a little heavier than what that 100 basis point drop has shown. I'm not so sure that necessarily carries forward, based on what we see to next year. But I'd probably would all else equal go back and say that again, it was meant to be a drop relative to what you would have otherwise expected, not necessarily a year-over-year drop if you think of it that way. So you'd have to work off your own models there and think of it that way. But I think it's probably relatively in line and you'd have to apply some proportional approach to it. Hope that helps. 
Alex Scott: Yes that's very helpful. And then maybe a follow-up on just thinking through top line growth, you have some businesses growing nicely. Holdings obviously, running off. Sales may be slowing a bit in Asia. When I think about all of the puts and takes, do you expect top line to be growing over the next couple of years? And I guess related, do you think you can get any operating leverage coming through in the form of that direct expense ratio still maybe continuing to drop a little bit as you achieve that?
John McCallion: Yes, in a month or maybe less or a little over a month we'll be giving you an outlook. I think we can go business-by-business. It's a little hard to do things at an aggregate level when you think of PFO sometimes, right just because the accounting for instruments can vary. So you have to think about that volume growth or opportunity based on different metrics. Sometimes PFOs are really good. Other times assets under management are better. And I think you're going to have to think of it business-by-business. But I think we believe we have a diverse set of businesses that gives us the ability to compete and win in a variety of economic cycles. That's one. Two, to your point of operating leverage, I think we've been showing that we can deliver despite -- in a variety of markets. We're well on track to meet our commitment by 2020 and I think if you did your own math today off of the annualized PFOs from a direct expense ratio, we're very close to the 800 I think mathematically already.
Alex Scott: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Josh Shanker: Thank you for taking my question. First question, I just want to understand the -- I guess the product introduction cycle and maybe the sales cycle in Asia. Obviously, we're seeing sales down in Japan, but up in other Asian countries? Are there new products coming in? Are the older products getting, sort of, I guess stable in the marketplace? What's happening in the various sales cycles?
Kishore Ponnavolu: So, this is Kishore. A couple of points. Overall, Asia, if you take Japan and Asia, the Other Asia together were down. Let's take Other Asia; we're up 8% on a constant currency basis. As John referenced Hong Kong, so if you exclude Hong Kong, which has now moved into discontinued ops, we're up 15%. And the three countries that drove that are Korea, China, and India. Now, we have a portfolio of countries and that's the good thing about the resiliency, right? So, if you exclude Hong Kong, overall, John referenced that Asia is actually up 1%, right? So, that's how it works. Now, with regards to each country, it's hard to go in and talk about product cycles because it's complicated per se. In Japan, generally speaking, our product cycles are longer because it's a more mature market and we take a little longer to react to changes in the marketplace or customer demands. But at the same time, these are all the things we're working on is to shorten that, increase our response time and to be able to react to these changes effectively. I hope that helps.
Josh Shanker: It helps. Great. Give more detail on the products, but I'll keep digging. And then in Property & Casualty, I'm trying to find out if 3Q 2018 was a light cash -- light catastrophe quarter or 3Q 2019 was a heavy? We haven't seen these kind of U.S. cat losses that some others, so trying to figure out how to think about that going forward?
Michel Khalaf: I would say Q3 2018 was a light one and Q3 2019 was right in line with expectations.
Josh Shanker: Okay, that's great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
John Barnidge: Thanks. I understand the P&C business has more of a Northeast bend, but can you kind of talk about exposure to the California wildfires please?
Michel Khalaf: Sure. If you look at our exposure in Q3 of last year, it was pretty benign in terms of the fire exposure. And you're right in terms of our geographic concentration, if you look at our market share in California, in home and compare that to the average market share that we have nationally, our market share in California is less than 75% -- 75% smaller than our national market share. So we're relatively less exposed there.
John Barnidge: Okay. And sticking with P&C. I get that you're talking about the increase in cats. But backing out both cats and reserve development, the underlying combined ratio looks like an increase 250 basis points from a year ago and 91.4 versus 88.9. Can you talk about maybe social inflation you may be seeing?
Michel Khalaf: I mean it's really the two factors I've talked about. So if you back out the cats, if you look at the earnings number, that just – that explains about half the difference. And the other half is specifically inflation in bodily injury claims. And there you talk about medical inflation cost, more litigation, more attorney-represented claims. And that's the trend we're watching carefully and taking appropriate rate actions against it.
John Barnidge: Is there anything you can say around loss cost trends, peg it at a certain percent? Thank you.
Michel Khalaf: Yeah. Not really at the moment.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to John Hall.
John Hall: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Have a happy Halloween. Talk to you soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note on the forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2019 earnings call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. Joining me this morning on the call are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released an expanded set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. The content for the slides begins following the romanette pages that feature a number of GAAP reconciliations. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that, given the busy earnings call scheduled this morning will extend no longer than the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. After Q&A, Michel will conclude with some closing remarks. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. During my first 90 days as President and CEO of MetLife, we have worked to reinforce the connection between our purpose and our strategy while strengthening our focus on consistent execution. For more than 150 years, this company has been helping people protect their families and their finances so that they can realize their full potential. We are committed to strong financial performance so that we can continue fulfilling this noble purpose for decades to come. MetLife had an excellent start to 2019 and last night, we reported strong second quarter results as well. Quarterly adjusted earnings totaled $1.3 billion or $1.38 per share, up from $1.30 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Excluding notable items, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.46 per share compared with $1.36 per share a year ago. Net income of $1.7 billion exceeded adjusted earnings, primarily due to interest rate-driven gains in our derivative portfolio. Net income totaled $845 million a year ago. Market conditions were mixed overall. Strong equity markets fueled the rebound in variable investment income. These gains were offset by the impact of falling interest rates on recurring investment margins and by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Although, the interest rate environment remains challenging, our results demonstrate that we have become a less market-sensitive company. John McCallion will discuss the interest rate environment in greater detail. MetLife's direct expense ratio benefited from solid revenue growth, favorable items and continued expense discipline. Excluding notable items and pension risk transfers, our direct expense ratio was 12.3% compared with 13% a year ago. Notable items in the quarter included the expenses associated with our unit cost initiative, which reduced adjusted earnings by $70 million. This initiative remains on track to deliver $800 million of annual pre-tax margin improvement by 2020, underscoring our commitment to expense discipline. Finally, MetLife's book value per share, a key indicator of shareholder value was $47.09, up 10% from a year ago. Moving to specific business highlights. Our flagship Group Benefits business reported strong adjusted earnings results in the second quarter, driven by volume growth and expense margins. Group Benefits sales are up 12% year-to-date, with growth across all markets. Voluntary products continue to see a particularly strong sales momentum. Adjusted earnings for our Retirement and Income Solutions business matched a strong quarter year ago, with higher variable investment income and favorable underwriting offsetting weaker recurring investment margins. Adjusted earnings for our Property & Casualty segment benefited from favorable underwriting, primarily lower incurred catastrophe losses, reflecting the re-underwriting of our homeowners business. Adjusted earnings for our Asia business were essentially flat, relative to a strong result a year ago. The negative impact of a strong U.S. dollar relative to most Asian currencies was offset by strong volume growth. Competition in the Japanese foreign currency denominated product market pressured FX sales from a year ago. This was partially offset by higher accident and health sales in Japan, as well as continued strong sales in China. Our Latin America business reported an 18% increase in adjusted earnings year-over-year. This was mostly due to strong Chilean encaje returns and good volume growth. For our EMEA business, adjusted earnings were down 10% from a very strong second quarter of 2018, but they were in line with our expectations on a constant currency basis. Sales strength was evident in the group business in the U.K. and credit life in Turkey. Overall, it was another strong quarter for our company. I believe we are making steady progress towards establishing a track record of consistent execution. One of my top 2019 priorities, as President and CEO of MetLife, is to complete the strategic review of our businesses. All our executive group members, along with many other leaders across the company are fully engaged in this process. I am pleased with the progress we are making on this next horizon of our strategy and we look forward to sharing the full results with investors on December 12. Our strategic changes are more likely to be evolutionary than revolutionary. We remain firmly committed to certain bedrock principles around deploying capital efficiently, generating strong risk-adjusted returns and driving profitable growth. Just as important, we are strengthening our efficiency mindset so that expense discipline and continuous improvement become embedded in our company's DNA. Consistent with our principles, we are taking steps to optimize our portfolio so that we can maximize the value of our highest potential businesses. The recent announcement to sell our Hong Kong business provides a good example. MetLife has strong franchises throughout Asia and we are committed to the region. However, after a thorough review of the Hong Kong business, we did not see a path to scale or risk-adjusted returns above our cost of capital. By selling this business, we will free up additional resources to enhance value creation. Strong value creation requires the right strategic choices, none more important than how we allocate capital. We always seek to deploy capital to produce the highest risk-adjusted returns whether through organic growth, M&A or returning capital to our shareholders. In the second quarter, MetLife returned $750 million of capital through share repurchases. For the first two quarters of 2019, we have returned more than $2 billion to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases. With only $20 million left on our prior authorization, our Board of Directors approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization last night. Sound capital management also demands close attention to capital structure. MetLife, Inc. recently saw an opportunity to issue its first ever yen-denominated senior notes offering, one of the largest ever offerings of yen debt by a U.S. financial services company. We issued nearly $1.4 billion of yen-denominated senior notes and use some of the proceeds to pay down debt with an average coupon well above that of the new yen debt. All in, the payback period on recovering our make-whole fee is only 13 months. In closing, we think the emerging picture of MetLife is clear. We are a financially strong company with a well-diversified portfolio of businesses that is focused on consistent execution. Our goal is to be a company that can perform well across a variety of economic environments. Our second quarter adjusted earnings results demonstrated that we are less exposed to market factors and that softness in one part of our business can often be offset by strength in another. Across MetLife, our people feel energized by our performance and excited by our potential. As we develop the next horizon of our strategy, we will continue viewing all major decisions through the lens of value creation for our customers, our people and our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to go through our second quarter results in greater detail.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 2Q 2019 supplemental slides that we released last evening, along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. Starting on page 5, the schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the second quarter of 2019. In the quarter, net income was $1.7 billion or $365 million higher than adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion. This variance is primarily due to higher net derivative gains resulting from the decline in interest rates in the quarter. Overall, the results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. We had one notable item in the quarter as shown on page 6 and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. Expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $70 million after-tax or $0.07 per share. Adjusted earnings excluding the notable item were $1.4 billion or $1.46 per share. On page 7, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were essentially flat year-over-year and up 2% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 7% and 10% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers included solid volume growth, the impact from strong equity markets, favorable underwriting and better expense margins. Investment margins were modestly higher, as a strong rebound in variable investment income was mostly offset by lower recurring interest margins. In addition, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies and higher taxes relative to a favorable 2Q 2018 were partial offsets. With regards to business performance, Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 19% year-over-year. The key drivers were better expense margins and solid volume growth. With respect to underwriting, favorable mortality in Group Life was mostly offset by less favorable Non-Medical Health results compared to the prior year. Group Life mortality ratio was 85.3%, which was favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.9% and at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Favorable results were primarily due to lower claim severity. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 75.4%, which is within our target range of 72% to 77%, though this result was less favorable than the prior year quarter of 73.1%, due to higher claim severity and disability. Group Benefits continues to see strong momentum in the top line. Adjusted PFOs in the quarter were up 5% and year-to-date sales were up 12%, led by the growth in voluntary products across all markets. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 1% year-on-year. The key drivers were favorable underwriting margins and volume growth. This was mostly offset by lower investment margins as weaker recurring interest margins exceeded the positive contribution from variable investment income for this segment. RIS investment spreads were 119 basis points in 2Q, 2019, down 10 basis points year-over-year, but up 23 basis points sequentially due to strong private equity returns and prepayment fees in the quarter. Despite the ongoing pressure from the inverted yield curve, we continue to expect full year RIS investment spreads to be in the bottom half of our 2019 guidance range of 100 to 125 basis points. RIS favorable underwriting was largely due to updated claim processes, which contributed approximately $30 million after tax. RIS adjusted PFOs were down 81% year-over-year, due to the strength of the FedEx PRT deal in the second quarter of 2018. Excluding PRTs, RIS PFOs were up 23% due to strong structured settlement sales. As for pension risk transfers, PFOs in the quarter were $556 million. We continue to see the PRT market as attractive, with a strong pipeline. Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 11%, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins. Pre-tax cat losses of $78 million in the quarter were $30 million lower than the prior year quarter. With regards to the top line, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 2%, while sales were up 3% versus 2Q, 2018. Asia adjusted earnings were down 1%, but up 2% on a constant currency basis. The positive year-over-year drivers were favorable volume growth and better investment margins, which includes the impact of a regulatory change in China. These were partially offset by less favorable expense margins and favorable underwriting margins in the prior year quarter. Asia assets under management, excluding fair value adjustments, grew 11% year-over-year. As part of our enhanced disclosures, we have now included Asia AUM as a key metric in our QFS. Asia sales were down 10% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were down 12% primarily driven by a 32% year-over-year decline in foreign currency denominated annuity products. FX annuity products, which are primarily sold through bank channels, had a challenging quarter, given the drop in U.S. interest rates. We anticipate further challenges for FX annuity products in the second half of the year. In contrast, we continue to see strong momentum in our A&H sales, which were up 12% year-over-year. A&H sales were aided by the popularity of our dollar-denominated rider, which we launched in November of 2018 and the increase in short-pay A&H products in advance of a tax regulatory change effective in October of this year. Other Asia sales were down 5% as growth in China and India were more than offset by lower sales in Korea. Latin America adjusted earnings were up 10% and 18% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were a favorable impact from capital markets on our Chilean encaje and volume growth across the region. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 9% and 15% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth across the region led by higher annuity sales in Chile. Latin America sales were up 14% on a constant currency basis driven by higher sales in Chile and Mexico, as well as a large group case in Brazil. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 10% but flat on a constant currency basis. Favorable underwriting, investment margins and volume growth, were offset by favorable expense margins in 2Q of 2018. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across the region. EMEA sales were up 6% on a constant currency basis due to higher volumes in employee benefits in the United Kingdom and Egypt as well as Credit Life in Turkey. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 7% primarily due to favorable expense margins. The benefit from higher variable investment income was entirely offset by lower recurring interest margins. With regards to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 53.9%, higher than the prior year quarter of 52.6% but within our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Mortality frequency was modestly higher than a year ago. The LTC block continue to perform well as results were favorable versus the prior year quarter due to improved experience in rate actions. Corporate & Other adjusted loss excluding notable items was $237 million. The higher adjusted loss in the quarter was primarily driven by two items: First, we had a make-whole fee related to early retirement of debt in the quarter of $32 million after-tax; and second, an after-tax adjusted loss of $17 million, regarding a sale of a block of business that had previously been reinsured. Also, please keep in mind that the timing of preferred stock dividends varies by quarter. In the first and third quarters of the year, we paid $32 million and in the second and fourth quarters, we paid $57 million. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 18.6% and within our 2019 guidance of 18% to 20%. Now let's turn to page 8 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the past six quarters, including $334 million earned in the current quarter. Our private equity portfolio, which is accounted for on a one quarter lag, rebounded strongly this quarter. For the year-to-date VII was $508 million pre-tax and well on track toward meeting our 2019 guidance range of $800 million to $1 billion. Now I'll discuss recurring investment income. Our new money rate was 4.01% versus a roll-off rate of 4.34% in 2Q, 2019. This compares to a new money rate of 3.98% and a roll-off rate of 4.52% in 2Q, 2018. Although, the gap between the new money rates and roll-off rates has narrowed, we would not expect parity to occur until we have a sustained U.S. 10-year Treasury yield of roughly 3% to 3.25%. Turning to page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2018 as well as the first two quarters of 2019. As we have stated previously, our goal is to realize $800 million of pre-tax profit margin improvement by 2020. This would represent an approximate 200 basis point decline in our annual direct expense ratio from the 2015 baseline year. We believe the annual direct expense ratio best reflects the impact on profit margins, as it captures the relationship of revenues and the expenses over which we have the most control. By successfully executing on our expense commitment, it will improve profit margins and provide capacity to fund future growth and innovation. We have made consistent progress towards achieving our target by 2020. As the chart illustrates, we have already achieved 140 basis point improvement in the annual direct expense ratio from 2015 to 2018. For 2Q, 2019, we posted another strong result, as the direct expense ratio, excluding notable items and PRTs, came in at 12.3%. This was aided by favorable items including; lower interest on tax reserves and lower employee benefit costs related to market movements in the second quarter. Overall, these favorable items totaled roughly 20 basis points and followed 60 to 70 basis points of favorable items in 1Q, 2019. Now let's turn to page 10. Given the drop in interest rates this quarter, we decided to add to this page on potential impacts to our income statement and balance sheet from low rates. First, we can confirm that the 2019 to 2021 adjusted earnings sensitivity that we previously provided is largely unchanged. Second, we expect our average 2019 and 2020 free cash flow ratio target of 65% to 75% to hold between a range of 1.5% to 4.5% on the 10-year U.S. Treasury. This is an update from our prior sensitivity guidance of 2% to 4.5%. And finally, the table at the bottom of page 10 provides the estimated impacts if we were to lower our long-term U.S. actuarial interest rate assumption of 4.25% by 25, 50 or 75 basis points. In each hypothetical scenario, we would not trigger GAAP loss recognition and would incur a relatively modest impact to net income. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at June 30, which is up from $3.2 billion at March 31. Holdco cash was elevated this quarter due to the timing of subsidiary dividends as well as the incremental debt issuance that Michel noted. Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our capital position. As a reminder, for our U.S. companies, our 2018 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 402%, which compares to our new target ratio of 360% following U.S. tax reform. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter 2019 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.4 billion, and net earnings were approximately $1.9 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $438 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of a prior year dividend from the investment subsidiary, partially offset by lower VA rider reserves and improved underwriting results. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.1 billion as of June 30, down 1% compared to December 31, 2018. Net earnings were more than offset by dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 890% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife had another strong quarter driven primarily by good fundamentals, growth in our businesses, solid underwriting and expense discipline. In addition, our cash and capital position as well as our balance sheet remains strong. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Can you talk about the outlook for expenses as we move into the second half of the year? You mentioned some favorable items in the first half, so should we expect the expense ratio to move a little bit higher given timing and seasonal factors? And if that's the case, are there any businesses where they should be more evident?
Michel Khalaf: Hey, good morning, Erik. I would definitely reiterate that. That was kind of our commentary last year that we had some seasonality in expenses in the second half of the year. We tend to see those expenses rise in places like group in terms of as we go through the enrollment process. And as we mentioned in the script, the first quarter, we saw some benefits that we didn't expect to recur similar to the second quarter so we want to normalize for those things anyway in addition to just the seasonality point.
Erik Bass: Got it. Thank you. And then you mentioned that there haven't been any material changes to your low interest scenario guidance that you've given in the 10-K. Can you talk about any potential actions that you can take to mute the impact particularly as we look out to 2020 or 2021?
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Look, I think we've been spending quite a bit of time over the last several years. I think if you go back to, let's start with, why is the impact muted, first, I think we've been trying to shift our risk profile for some time now, and that's starting to take effect. Obviously, when you think about those results, we have some good ALM discipline and I think that's coming through in sensitivities that we have. In terms of further actions, I think, yeah, look we're always considering, we're constantly reevaluating our ALM practices, looking at outlook in terms of interest rates and where the forward curve may be and things like that. So there are actions we can take, but everything is kind of on the margin. The most important thing we have is, price the business appropriately. And I think that's starting to come through and you can see that in that page.
Erik Bass: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning. I'd like to talk a bit about the favorable - well, maybe low end of guidance, benefit ratios. So you came in at 85.3 on Group Life. And then, with the non-medical and you're guiding to 72 to 77. You came in at 75.4. That's after 72.9 last quarter and then 72.6 in 2018, so both of them are pretty much in the more favorable end of the guidance ranges. Can you talk a bit about the competitive environment out there and the ability to kind of stay in that kind of lower quadrant of your guidance?
Ramy Tadros: Good morning, Andrew. It's Ramy here. As you know, we do operate in a competitive environment, but the group business is a business that we've been investing in, in a disciplined way over time and we're seeing that strategy materialize. And I would say, in general, we look to differentiate beyond price. We look at the product set and the right product set that we have, our service capabilities our distribution reach. So having said all of that, this is still insurance and you'd expect to see quarter-on-quarter volatility. So the mortality loss ratio, we did come in at the lower end of our range, but I would guide you for the full year number that's going to revert back somewhere to the middle of that range from a mortality perspective. The Non-Medical Health benefit for this quarter was slightly above the midpoint, but if you actually look at it from a year-to-date basis, it was slightly below. So, again, on both of those ratios I would guide you towards the middle of our guidance and we feel confident that we're able to get there.
Andrew Kligerman: And no competitive pressures out there to kind of lower your prices?
Ramy Tadros: We do some - we do see competitive pressures, but we're able to hold our own and we're able to, in some cases, we walk away from business, but -- where we think pricing is irrational, but you could see from a top line perspective, you look at our persistency in our rate actions. Our PFO number is 5% year-on-year, which is smack in the middle of our range. So we have a number of levers at our disposal that we pull to hold our own and maintain both top line and bottom line here.
Andrew Kligerman: Excellent. And then just a follow-up question. In the Asian operations, so some weakness in Korea and then also some weakness in the FX-denominated sales in Japan. Again, I'm just kind of curious what happened in Korea? What's the competitive landscape like there? And same question with respect to Japan.
Kishore Ponnavolu: This is Kishore. Let me take the Korea question first. Year-on-year sales in Korea declined 14%. I want to give you a little bit of context in Korea. We have three channels in Korea. Our Korea agency channel that has held really well. Our general agency channel, which is a significant channel and our MFS channel which is a relatively smaller portion of our sales. In the GA channel, we sell mostly savings in retirement products, and that channel from a market perspective took a hit in the second quarter. The overall market for savings in retirement products dropped by about 25%, and we believe that's because of the equity market volatility in Korea. So we got that our proportionate share there, but I want to shift to a positive note with regards to Korea is because we have a number of in-market actions. We've actually increased the manpower in our Korea agency. We launched a couple of products, which are actually getting very good traction. So because of that, second half, we expect Korea sales to come back pretty strong. With regards to -- sorry, go ahead.
Andrew Kligerman: No, no, I was saying in Japan, yes.
Kishore Ponnavolu: So, in Japan, if you think quarter-on-quarter, we're down 32% in the annuity sales, right? So let me give you a little bit of context on annuity sales. The vast majority of our annuity sales come through our banker channel. It's a little bit volatile channel, right? If you look at 2018 second quarter sales, we almost had $200 million of sales. And relative to 2017, that was 136% increase year-on-year come off, reinforce the volatility point. So against that high watermark, this year, we're down 32%. And there are two drivers for that, right? Number one driver is the volumes through the banker channel for foreign denominated products actually came down. So year-on-year, the volume fell 9%. So what's the reason for that? We believe it's U.S. dollar interest rate softening, and that means the value proposition for customers is a little weaker relative as a result of that. Now that's only a 9% decline, okay? There's a second factor. The second factor is that given that there's a strong interest in this particular segment, there have been some new entrants into the space, and some of them have been very aggressive with their crediting rates. We've been in this business for a long time, and we're very disciplined player, and we refuse to change volume, and so we're going to be leaning on our strength here. We have strong banker relationship, got 120-plus bank relationships. We believe we have advantages on investment management side on the dollar-denominated products that others may or may not have, and so we're going to leverage this. So we're going to see some softness here for the next couple of quarters, as Michel and John referenced, but we believe that the market will come back through the banker channel. And on top of that, we'll get our fair share. I hope that helps.
Andrew Kligerman: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. I had a couple of questions. First, on just Michel your priorities for deploying capital, different stories about you potentially selling your Central European business, the Hong Kong business, and I realize you can't comment on deals. But if you were -- like, what are your priorities in terms of cash that might be generated either through the business or from potential sales between acquisitions, investing in the business and possibly buying back stock? 
Michel Khalaf: Yeah. Hi, Jimmy. Well, first of all, let me sort of reiterate, in terms of our capital management philosophy, we believe that excess capital, beyond what we need to fund organic growth and for strategic acquisitions that clear risk-adjusted hurdle rate, belongs to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As you know, we are conducting a strategic review and I would say that that work is moving along nicely. Without getting into too much detail, strategy is about choices and paramount among them is how we deploy capital, as well as other scarce resources. Our commitment to value creation requires us to exercise discipline across all capital, including capital supporting new business, as well as in-force business, not just excess capital. This means that pricing new product at appropriate internal rates of return with appropriate payback periods. It also means optimizing of our portfolio when and if necessary. Let me point out that since the MetLife acquired Alico, we've divested more than 20 businesses, some large like our U.S. Retail business and other smaller such as the Hong Kong business. In all cases, we've been careful and deliberate. As the business is not meeting our return hurdles and we do not see a clear runway to doing so within a reasonable time frame, we have to consider alternatives, including divestitures, to free up capital for greater value creation over time. So that's our approach. I think it's consistent with how we've done things to-date. And as I've noted, since the Alico acquisition we've had a number of divestitures, but I would certainly not comment on any particular rumors that have been out there.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on -- just for John maybe, on the accounting changes, obviously they were delayed by a year. But do you have any insights on how MetLife would be affected, that you're able to share? And I'm assuming that MetLife Holdings is the most susceptible business to the changes in long-duration accounting contracts. So if you could just comment on, like, if you've got better insights on what the impact of the changes would be on MetLife's balance sheet and/or earnings going forward?
John McCallion: Good morning, Jimmy. Yes we are supportive of the proposed delay, still needs to be voted on, but we are supportive of that. I don't think it changes anything in terms of impact to us in terms of the timing, other than it gives us and the industry a chance to work together on implementation. In terms of which segments are most -- holdings would be one of them. I think wherever we have FAS 60 business, which would be holdings, there're some in RIS or some in Asia, those would also be impacted.
Jimmy Bhullar: And are you planning on sharing the expected impacts anytime in the next few quarters, or is it going to be as we get further - as we get closer to the actual standards going into effect?
John McCallion: Yeah. No, no. I think we - nothing soon. This is a lot of work. It's a complex standard, which is why we support the additional year, and I think it's appropriate for us in the industry to kind of work through this so that we can present these new information in the most effective and efficient way.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Good morning. First question is just some on the interest rate sensitivity disclosure you put out there. So the U.S. sensitivity looks pretty low to changes in interest rates for U.S. GAAP. John, is it fair to say that if you also considered the sensitivity to both Japan and EMEA, it would also be modest, or -- and also are those predominantly about the FAS 60 products there, do you have a decent amount of 97 in those regions?
John McCallion: Yes. So just to be clear crystal clear, that sensitivity that's provided there is for changing the U.S. 10-year Treasury rate long-term assumption, right, which is our reversion to, at this point, 4.25%, and as you comment or references, it impacts our U.S. segments. In EMEA, I would say the mix of business doesn't really cause kind of a material number to arrive one way or another. And rates have been pretty low, and we assume that's the case anyway. In Japan, like when we test loss recognition -- for loss recognition there, we use current rates and just assume they don't revert anywhere. They just stay state level. So...
Tom Gallagher: Got it. So the Japanese interest rate assumption is at current spot rate, like that’s your…
John McCallion: When we do loss recognition testing in Japan, we assume spot and then level from there.
Tom Gallagher: Got it. That's for loss recognition testing?
John McCallion: Yes.
Tom Gallagher: Okay. And then my follow-up is just on the new disclosure in the supplement about the Japan assets shows there's been pretty strong asset growth there, and I know you mentioned annuity sales declining. How -- if we're going to be in this lower level of annuity sales, is that -- how did net flows look? Like would you -- because I think it was double-digit growth in assets there based on current sales volumes. Would you still have positive flows there? And would you still get a decent amount of asset growth if we remain around current levels?
Kishore Ponnavolu: Tom, this is Kishore. So at the last outlook call at the Investor Day and also at the outlook call, we said high single-digit asset growth for Asia, as a segment. We're sticking to that, and there's no change at this point. If the question is in regards to a slowdown with regards to annuities, certainly I want to remind you that there are other lines which have actually gone the other way. A&H, Michel talked about the 12% increase in A&H. That's the advantage of a multiproduct multi-distribution business. In addition, earlier, I talked about some year-over-year decline for the second quarter with annuities from the bank segment. We expect that to change and obviously moderate over time. And, certainly, we expect to get our fair share back. So this is a quarter or two, but over the medium term we expect to get back to our fair share.
Tom Gallagher: Okay.
Michel Khalaf: I would just add, Tom, to Kishore's comments, also in the foreign-denominated annuity products and other products that we sell, there's a very high persistency there. So just from a net perspective, it's a good statistic to think about.
Tom Gallagher: Got it. Yeah. That's what I was trying to get at. The -- I presume there're still strong positive flows, even after the decline in annuity sales, but I can circle back for more detail.
Kishore Ponnavolu: So the one extra thing to John is also, Tom, a bulk of these annuity sales are single premium. And so, because they're single premium, the full impact of these sales are not necessarily reflected in the A&P and they show up on assets.
Tom Gallagher: Got you. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I have a follow-up question on the strategic review. I know that it includes potential dispositions. I'm curious, I guess as you're doing the strategic review, does it also contemplate the need for potential M&A and other businesses where you feel like you needed additional capabilities or scale?
Michel Khalaf: Yes, absolutely, Ryan. We are -- part of our review is looking for also ways to accelerate revenue growth, especially in markets and businesses where -- that we feel are attractive and where we have a competitive advantage. We're always looking at M&A opportunities as a way to further enhance our growth. Clearly, we look for opportunities that are a good fit with our strategy and that are accretive and we have also a consistent way of evaluating many opportunities globally. We look at value and cash generation. Clearly, those deals need to earn more than their cost of capital. We also evaluate M&A against alternative uses of capital. We consider capital markets the cost of raising capital in our assessments, but we continue to look at M& A as an opportunity for us to drive growth or enhance efficiency in certain businesses and markets.
Ryan Krueger: Thanks. And then on the interest rate scenario to earnings in the 10-K, there's a very minimal impact on 2019, steps up some in 2020 though, though not all that large. I guess, just the delta between, I guess, the reason it's so minimal in 2019 and then steps up in 2020. Does that really to things like interest rate for us, or is there something else going on there?
John McCallion: Yeah. Hey, Ryan. So -- and remember that was 100 basis point parallel shift, right, that we gave you. And I think the punch line, as we said, was that largely intact. It wasn't quite -- it hasn't been quite parallel. Right. The long end has dropped further than the short end, so there's a - that non-parallel shift and we talked about this before, it does have, call it, a negative impact on sec lending. The reason to your question, the reason why it's smaller in the first year is, it's mainly derivative. It's not necessarily floors, although we have those too, but it's just even the pay lag on our receivers swap, right? So as LIBOR drops, your pay lag and your expense goes down.
Ryan Krueger: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on interest rate question related to the hedges. Can you just quantify what that benefit is that you're getting today and how that should track over the next couple of years?
John McCallion: Yes. We don't have that specifically, Suneet, broken out. I would just again, I think, we would revert back to the kind of the overall. There's a lot of different items going on in there that some things that benefit for from just the drop in LIBOR. There's others that have more of an impact on the longer end, and so that's the part of our, I think, diversified portfolio that benefit here. We do get some offsets from having the short end of the curve drop as well in a positive way, but we haven't broken out each individual component. We just kind of revert back to kind of the aggregate change.
Suneet Kamath: Got it. And the reason I ask is, I am looking at, I think the last time you gave the slide that showed the trajectory of the derivative income was years ago, but it did look like somewhere around 2020, 2021, there was sort of a leg down in terms of the benefit that you get and I know this was pretty bright house I just want to get a sense is that still roughly the picture that we should be expecting going forward?
John McCallion: Yes, I think you're referencing -- I mean it’s probably more than a few years ago, right, the trajectory of the floors. Is that what you're talking about?
Suneet Kamath: Yes, I think it was from your 2016 outlook call but I think that’s the last time we got it. So…
John McCallion: It’s probably pre-John Hall. But, no, I think, certainly, we certainly at one point, those were one major benefit to lower rates, those have probably declined over time in terms of the amount of floors we have. But we've continued at different times to take up -- look, when the risk of rates rising, which was not too long ago was the major risk, we actually took the opportunity to add some floors. And so in our RIS segment, you know, we have talked about spreads and actually if LIBOR continues to drop, that sensitivity to LIBOR is going to start to flip. And that's partly due to the fact that we were opportunistic to buy some additional floors there that have a strike starting at 2%. So it's kind of it evolves over time, and it's not so static.
Suneet Kamath: Maybe an update at some point would be helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Good morning. My first question goes back to slide 10 as well. I was wondering if you could -- with the low interest rate sensitivity if you could just give us a sense of what scenario would actually drive a GAAP loss recognition charge. I know you haven't laid it out in any of these assumptions that you have on the slide, probably seems like would have to be a pretty big impact.
John McCallion: Yes, I think that's the punch line. It would need to be a pretty big impact. I mean even beyond. We showed 25, 50 and 75 even beyond that. We have quite a bit of healthy loss recognition testing margins in the U.S. in our FAS 60 business. So to get kind of a full unlocking our loss recognitions impact, it would take quite a bit of a drop in that long-term rate assumption.
Elyse Greenspan: And then I noticed in footnote three that it says, this includes MetLife Holdings. So does this interest rate scenario assumption, does that includes - incorporate in your LTC block?
John McCallion: Yes it does.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then, lastly on the PRT side of things, that business is typically been more second half heavy in terms of deals. I know we're obviously dealing with a lower interest rate environment. Have you guys seeing any change in the pipeline of no potential transactions that you might see towards the later stages of this year?
Michel Khalaf: Yeah. We actually are still seeing a very robust pipeline in the PRT space. And in particular, we're seeing a pretty robust pipeline on some of the jumbo deals. Clearly, over time, as rates come down, that would impact volumes in this market, but it really depends on the ALM posture of the pension plan. Some of those plans are already better matched and therefore are more insulated to falling grades and are getting the benefit from rising equity markets. So having said all of that, I think, over time lower rates will be headwind to volumes, but for now we're still seeing a very robust second half pipeline.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling and Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Lee: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just a question about the expenses, which have been a very good story, especially in the life holdings. I was just wondering can you take our more expenses from holdings now, or do you see kind of the current level as good as it gets, given some of the favorable expenses that you see in the first half of this year?
John McCallion: Yeah. I think as we go through this unit cost initiatives, a good portion of those initiatives help reduce some of the expenses there in holdings. In addition to just like, I call, BAU and the efforts that we're taking. Obviously, this is a business that will gradually run off. So I think the relationship there in expenses is a pretty good kind of way to think about it. In terms -- over time as the business runs off, we'd also expect the expenses to run down as well.
Humphrey Lee: Got it. And then, in terms of the recurring interest margin, you've talked about expecting more towards the lower end of the guidance range, given where rates are. I recall last quarter you talked about your holding a little bit more cash and short-term investments. Have you redeployed those? Are you trying to hold on to those and kind of maybe be more opportunistic down the road?
John McCallion: Yeah, sure. So just to reiterate and this is what I said in my opening remarks, we still expect full year to be within our -- this is for RIS, our 2019 guidance of 100 to 125, albeit at the bottom end of that range. Also, in addition to VII, as you mentioned the sequential improvement was helped by the fact that we did deploy some of that excess cash one hand that we referenced in the first quarter. So even though interest rates fell, there was -- and there was a further inversion of LIBOR. We were able to improve our spreads sequentially. And I think the last thing I'd point out and it's timely, we had the Fed -- the latest fed rate cut yesterday, the forward curves projecting a steepening from here and so we're starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel for, I'd say, spread compression in that business. So any improvement won't happen immediately and at these projected levels any benefit would be probably modest, but it starts to put us near or at the bottom of spread compression for this segment for some time. 
Humphrey Lee: Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd now like to turn the call back to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you. Let me close by saying how pleased I am with our second quarter results especially in light of a challenging capital market environment. Overall, we delivered another very good quarter in which our diversified set of businesses demonstrated their fundamental strength. I want to thank everyone for joining us today on a busy morning, and I look forward to speaking with you again soon. Have a great day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note on the forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release.  With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Before starting, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portions of metlife.com and our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review.  Joining me this morning on the call are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management.  Last night, we released an expanded set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. The content for the slides begins following the romanette pages that feature a number of GAAP reconciliations.  After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that, given the busy earnings call scheduled this morning, will extend no longer than the top of the hour. [Operator Instructions]. Finally, before we get started, I would ask that you save a date December 12 for us. We will host an Investor Day on that date here in New York City. More information on the agenda, which will include our outlook for 2020 and beyond, will follow.  With that, I will turn the call over to Michel.
Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. It's an honor to join you today as the 17th President and CEO of MetLife and the company's 151 year history. Before I talk about our first quarter results, I want to thank Steve Kandarian for everything he did over the past 8 years to help us build a better company. Steve tackled big challenges and made bold decisions. His actions strengthened our balance sheet, improved our free cash flow and gave us a solid platform for profitable growth. I'm grateful for his leadership and look forward to building on that foundation as we move toward the next horizon of our strategy.  This company has a proud history of making and keeping promises. Through our work, we provide financial security for tens of millions of people and invest to support economic growth. It's a noble purpose, one that our employees carry out every day. Thanks to their efforts and dedication, MetLife is a trusted partner to individuals and institutions all around the world. Looking ahead, our task is clear: deliver great value for our customers, our shareholders and our people. That requires consistent execution across the board. Coming off a strong 2018, MetLife reported excellent first quarter results last night. Quarterly adjusted earnings totaled $1.4 billion or $1.48 per share, up from $1.36 per share a year ago.  While variable investment income was lower as expected, adjusted earnings per share benefited from solid volume growth across all ongoing businesses, strong life and Non-Medical Health underwriting margins and Group Benefits, continued expense discipline and the cumulative impact of capital management. Reflecting the strong results, our quarterly adjusted return on equity was 13.2%. As for notable items, adjusted earnings were $1.54 per share. Notable items in the quarter included $0.06 per share of costs associated with our unit cost initiative, which remains on track to achieve $800 million of annual pretax margin improvement by 2020. Net income was $1.3 billion or $1.40 per share, up from $1.19 per share a year ago. Our efforts to manage the sensitivity of net income through the capital markets and narrow the gap between net income and adjusted earnings continue to show progress. Moving to some business highlights. Within the U.S. business segment, Group Benefits reported very strong underwriting results for both life and Non-Medical Health coverages, reversing less favorable trends in the fourth quarter of 2018. Group Benefits also posted record sales driven by voluntary products, which we continue to see as a growth opportunity.  In our Retirement and Income Solutions business, while we experienced good asset growth, adjusted earnings were adversely affected by lower variable investment income and investment spreads. Within Property & Casualty, good homeowners underwriting and modest catastrophe losses contributed to solid adjusted earnings.  For our international segments, Asia benefited from volume growth and strong foreign currency product and A&H sales in Japan. Our Latin America results included a strong contribution from there in Kihei. And our EMEA business benefited from good underwriting and volume growth. These results provide further confirmation that MetLife strategy is working and that we're hitting our stride on delivering consistent execution. The strength of our last five quarters combined tells the same story. MetLife is a long-term business, and taking the long view is the best way to evaluate our performance. We are encouraged by our first quarter results, but we are even more encouraged by the last five quarters put together.  My job as President and CEO is to continuingly ensure that we have the right strategy in place and the right people to make that strategy a success. I have made significant progress in establishing my senior leadership team following the recent appointments of, among others, Ramy Tadros as President of our U.S. business; and Marlene Debel as our Chief Risk Officer. I feel confident in the team we are assembling and excited about MetLife's future. On strategy, I believe we are on the right path while recognizing there is always room for improvement. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call, we are at an inflection point and I'm committed to MetLife's core goals of capital efficiency, strong risk-adjusted returns and profitable growth. While we have accomplished much in these areas, we still have work to do to accelerate revenue growth, further optimize our business and product portfolios and approach expense discipline as a journey of continuous improvement rather than a single destination.  These goals informed our recent decision to move MetLife Holdings, which contains the closed block businesses of our former U.S. Retail segment, to our finance organization. This new arrangement will sharpen our focus on serving our customers and creating value for our shareholders. I believe the only way to achieve sustainable success is by staying laser-focused on our customers' needs and expectations. That is the bedrock on which MetLife has built a number of great businesses. Here in the U.S., annual adjusted earnings from our market share-leading U.S. group business have grown to more than $1 billion. Our average national accounts group customer has been with us for 22 years, and several customers are approaching the century mark. Overall, the business covers more than 40 million U.S. employees and their dependents.  In Mexico, we are the #1 life insurer with a dominant business that serves millions of public sector workers and has made MetLife part of the fabric of Mexican society. In Japan, our largest business outside the U.S. and our largest retail life insurance business anywhere in the world, we pioneered foreign exchange products that have allowed us to grow in a mature market by meeting customers' needs for better returns on their savings.  In China, one of the world's largest and most rapidly growing insurance markets, MetLife has grown rapidly as well. The Chinese municipalities and provinces where we operate are home to more than 0.5 billion people and account for 55% of GDP, positioning us well to serve the needs of China's growing middle-class. Businesses like these highlight MetLife's underlying strength and potential, but again, it all starts with how we serve our customers. I've been running insurance businesses since the early 1990s, and one of my core convictions is that only by creating value for customers can we create value for shareholders.  Over the past few months, I've traveled to many of MetLife's key markets outside the U.S., including all the countries I just mentioned. Our people around the world take great pride in being there for MetLife's customers when they need us the most. I approach MetLife's challenges informed by certain guiding principles developed over a 25-year career, leading insurance businesses on 4 continents around the world. My leadership style is close to the ground and focused on winning. I believe speed, agility and innovation are critical to strengthening our competitive advantage. MetLife has reinvented itself multiple times over its 151-year history, and we will look to accelerate innovation as a driver of growth.  I recognize that capital is precious and that our shareholders have choices about where to invest. MetLife's decisions on capital deployment will continue to be driven by what produces the best risk-adjusted returns. Everything we do, organic growth, capital return and acquisitions, will be viewed through the lens of value creation. To that end, we recently announced a 4.8% increase in our quarterly dividend while returning more than $900 million of capital to shareholders in the first quarter through common dividends and share repurchases. On my second official day leading MetLife, I want you to know that I'm starting this job with a real sense of urgency. The entire leadership team has a strong commitment to accelerating the pace of value creation for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to John McCallion to go through our first quarter results in greater detail.
John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll begin by discussing the 1Q '19 supplemental slides that we released last evening along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. Starting on Page 4. This schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the first quarter of 2019. In the quarter, net income was $1.3 billion or $75 million lower than adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. While this will change from quarter-to-quarter, the modest variance between net income and adjusted earnings reflects the progress we made to reduce the volatility of our business. Overall, the results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected.  We had one notable item in the quarter, as shown on Page 5 and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. Expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $55 million after-tax or $0.06 per share. Adjusted earnings excluding the notable item were $1.5 billion or $1.54 per share. On Page 6, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 6% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 15% and 18% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers included solid volume growth, favorable underwriting, better expense margins and the impact from strong equity markets in the quarter. These were partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and less favorable variable investment income, which I will discuss in more details shortly.  With regards to business performance, Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 57% year-over-year. The key drivers were favorable underwriting, better expense margins and solid volume growth. With respect to underwriting, the Group Life mortality ratio was 85.3%, our best Q1 performance in over 15 years and at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Favorable results were primarily due to low incidence and the mild flu season.  The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 72.9%, which was lower than the 75.9% in the prior year quarter and at the low end of our target range of 72% to 77%. The year-over-year improvement in the ratio was primarily driven by continued positive trends in disability while dental utilization trends were generally in line with expectations. Group Benefits continues to see strong momentum in its top line. Adjusted PFOs in the quarter were up 3,%, and 5% excluding participating customers, where PFOs can fluctuate with claim experience. Group Benefits sales in the quarter were a record up 11% versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to continued strength in voluntary products. Combination of our brand, product set, customer base and distribution reach positions us to leverage the ongoing shift of voluntary benefits in a differentiated way.  National account sales and renewals were strong, and we continue to see double-digit growth in both regional and small market sales. While results for Group Benefits will show some quarter-to-quarter volatility, this combination of strong top and bottom line results is a testament to our compelling customer value proposition and disciplined approach to pricing. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 16% year-on-year. The key drivers were less favorable investment margins partially offset by solid volume growth. RIS investment spreads were 96 basis points in 1Q '19, down 32 basis points year-over-year. The decline in the investment spreads were primarily due to ongoing pressure from the flatter yield curve as well as lower private equity returns in the quarter.  For the full year, we expect RIS investment spreads to trend higher with full year coming in towards the bottom half of our 2019 guidance range of 100 to 125 basis points. RIS adjusted PFOs were up 64% year-over-year due to strong structured settlement sales. As for pension risk transfers, although we did not book any transactions in the quarter, we closed on a $500 million PRT deal in early April. We continue to see the PRT market as attractive with a strong pipeline.  Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 1% primarily due to favorable underwriting margins and volume growth. This was mostly offset by higher expenses primarily related to marketing costs. Pretax cat losses were $41 million in the quarter, which was $17 million lower than the prior year quarter. With regards to the top line, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 2% while sales were up 12% versus 1Q '18. Asia adjusted earnings were up 9% and 13% on a constant currency basis primarily due to strong volume growth in the region. The key drivers were higher accident and health sales and AUM growth in Japan as well as growth in Korea and China. This was partially offset by more favorable underwriting in the prior year quarter. Asia sales were up 9% on a constant currency basis.  In Japan, sales were up 13% primarily driven by Accident & Health and foreign currency products. A&H and FX products remain our primary focus in Japan, and we continue to see strong momentum in the market. Other Asia sales were up 3%, primarily driven by growth in China and India. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 4% and 1% on a constant currency basis. The primary driver was higher expenses versus 1Q '18, which benefited from a litigation reserve release. This was mostly offset by the favorable impact from equity markets in our Chilean and Kihei as well as higher investment margins and volume growth across the region. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 4% on a constant currency basis driven by volume growth across the region led by AFP Provida in Mexico. This was partially offset by the cancellation of government contracts in Mexico. Latin America sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis due to higher Mexico sales.  EMEA adjusted earnings were up 6% and 23% on a constant currency basis primarily due to favorable underwriting and volume growth. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on a constant currency basis reflecting growth across the region. EMEA sales were up 3% on a constant currency basis due to higher volumes in employee benefits in the United Kingdom and Credit Life in Turkey. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings excluding notable items in 1Q '18 were down 13% year-over-year. The primary drivers were lower investment margins primarily from weaker private equity returns and more favorable underwriting in the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by improved expense margins and favorable equity markets.  In regards to equity market performance within MetLife Holdings, Retail Annuities separate account returns were up 10% in the quarter, which resulted in an initial positive market impact of approximately $15 million to adjusted earnings and an ongoing positive impact of approximately $5 million to adjusted earnings. These were roughly in line with our sensitivity guidance. Corporate & Other adjusted loss excluding notable items was $138 million. Overall, the company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 18.7% and within our 2019 guidance of 18% to 20%. Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 9 quarters, including $174 million earned in the first quarter.  You can see that variable investment income, as the name implies, can vary from quarter-to-quarter but tends to fall in proximity to our quarterly VII range of $200 million to $250 million. Our private equity portfolio, which is accounted for on a 1 quarter lag, was clearly impacted by equity market weakness in 4Q '18 although results were better than expected. We continue to expect full year VII to be within our 2019 guidance range of $800 million to $1 billion. Now I will discuss recurring investment income. Our new money rate rose from 3.37% a year ago to 4.04% in 1Q '19. At the same time, our average roll-off rate has dropped from 4.38% a year ago to 4.15% in the first quarter. Although the gap between new money rates and roll-off rates has narrowed, we would not expect pairing to occur until we have a sustained U.S. 10-year Treasury yield of roughly 3% to 3.25%. In absolute dollars, recurring investment income was up 4% compared to a year ago, primarily due to higher asset balances, which offset the roll-off of higher-yielding securities.  Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2018 as well as 1Q '19. As we have stated previously, our goal is to realize $800 million of pretax profit margin improvement by 2020. This would represent an approximate 200 basis point decline in our annual direct expense ratio from the 2015 baseline year. We believe the annual direct expense ratio best reflects the impact on profit margins as it captures the relationship of revenues and the expenses over which we have the most control. By successfully executing on our expense commitment, it will improve profit margins and provide additional capacity to fund future growth and innovation. We continue to make consistent progress towards achieving our target by 2020. As the chart illustrates, we have already achieved 140 basis point improvement in the annual direct expense ratio from 2015 to 2018. For 1Q '19, the direct expense ratio was exceptionally strong at 12.1%. This was aided by favorable items including lower interest on tax reserves and lower employee benefits related to market movements in the first quarter. Overall, these favorable items totaled roughly 60 to 70 basis points. Therefore, we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher for the remainder of the year but still show improvement versus 2018.  I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Slide 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $3.2 billion at March 31, which is up from $3 billion at December 31. A $200 million increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend and holding company expenses. As we noted previously, we are comfortable holding cash at the low end of our $3 billion to $4 billion holding company's buffer given our low-risk profile and the modest amount of debt that we have maturing over the next few years including none in 2019.  Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, our 2018 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 402%, which compares to our new target ratio of 360% following U.S. tax reform. For our U.S. company's, preliminary first quarter 2019 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.2 billion, and net earnings were approximately $1.1 billion.  Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $600 million from the prior year quarter primarily due to improved underwriting results, lower operating expenses and lower VA writer reserves. These were partially offset by lower net investment margins. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $16.6 billion as of March 31, 2019, down 9% compared to December 31, 2018. Net earnings were more than offset by dividends declared to be paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 803% as of December 31, which is the latest public data.  Overall, MetLife had a very strong 2018, and execution continues in 2019 driven primarily by good fundamentals, solid underwriting, growth in our businesses and expense discipline. In addition, our cash and capital position, as well as our balance sheet, remains strong.  Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking will continue to drive free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value.  And with that, I will turn back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW.
Ryan Krueger: Michel, could you discuss your M&A philosophy and if there's any areas of particular focus that you would look to add going forward?
Michel Khalaf: Sure. So we always look at M&A opportunities that fit our strategy and are accretive over time. We evaluate those opportunities on a consistent basis globally with a view on value and cash generation. These deals need to earn more than their cost of capital.  We also evaluate M&A opportunities against alternative uses of capital. Obviously, we consider capital markets, the cost of raising capital and synergies in our assessment, and we will always look to achieve a healthy balance between returning cash to our shareholders and strategic M&A activity that can help us accelerate our growth.  So hopefully, this gives you an idea about our philosophy on M&As. And again if you're looking at strategic fit, think about businesses and markets where we -- that are growth markets where we believe that potentially M&A can help us further drive our growths. Those would be the businesses and markets where we will consider such deals.
Ryan Krueger: And then just in regards to your comment on innovation, I guess things like that can come at, I guess, a near-term expense. So I just want to -- it sounds like you're pretty committed to the $800 million expense save target. But I just wanted to hear your thoughts and if there's any major areas of incremental investment that you think are required and if you can still achieve the $800 million in light of that.
Michel Khalaf: So I'm 100% committed to the $800 million pretax profit margin improvement by 2020 target, and we're fully on track to achieve that. I think we've done a good job over the last several years actually of repurposing some savings and reinvesting in technology and innovation, and we look to continue to do that. The other thing I will say here and I mentioned it in my remarks, is that we are making sure that expense discipline is a muscle, is part of our culture here. It's embedded in everything that we do, and we see this efficiency and expense discipline as a journey of continuous improvement as opposed to a single destination. So we are committed to our target and we believe that we'll have opportunities to continue to invest in innovation and in our growth.
Operator: And next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Crédit Suisse.
Andrew Kligerman: Michel, you made a comment that you want to accelerate the pace of value creation. And you also mentioned that you moved MetLife Holdings to the finance unit. Are there any implications there that you might be more inclined to divest of certain blocks of business in MLH, notably long-term care, but any blocks within that?
Michel Khalaf: So look, with Marty Lippert's retirement, we felt there was an opportunity to better align MetLife Holdings' reporting with our core objectives, and for me, there are 3 core objectives for the business. One is to deliver on our obligations to our policyholders. Two is to continue to reduce the risk and volatility of that business. And three is to optimize value.  So we feel that having MetLife Holdings report to finance and to John will help us sharpen our focus on these objectives. And we've said before and I'll repeat that we will consider all options to optimize the value of the business, and we don't rule anything out. Any transaction that we believe makes sense economically is something that we would consider.
Andrew Kligerman: Great. And then just kind of shifting over to RIS, the investment yield came in at 4.52%, excluding variable investment income, and that sequentially was down from 4.8%, So I'm -- and I understand you had some extra cash on the balance sheet so that might have hurt it by 4 to 6 basis points. But it's a pretty big drop off, so I'm hoping that someone can give me a little guidance on where that yield is going. You also mentioned some roll-off of higher-yielding securities. So where do you see that going over the next few quarters in the RIS segment?
John McCallion: It's John. I would focus on the spread itself. And just for this quarter we -- there was a new accounting related to derivative hedging so there was a reclass between the yield and interest credited so that might just change the trend a little bit. But I think I would focus a bit on the spread itself. So let me talk about the spread. And obviously, we came in below the range we provided at the outlook call of 100 to 125, so a couple of things.  First, the range and the sensitivities we provided, I would take those as full year ranges, and those can certainly deviate from any one quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, while Q1 was below the range, we still believe and expect the full year to be within the range albeit maybe the lower half of that range. But there is two drivers to the Q1 underperformance. So first, we did have a slightly higher allocation to shorter-term assets during the quarter as we continue to look to shift out of certain assets that are more susceptible to a market downturn, and so we see this mostly as timing. And as rates declined that had about a 5 to 6 basis point impact.  The second thing we saw was a good portion of our sec lending business does get allocated to the segment. And to the inversion of the short end of the curve relative to LIBOR has put pressure on our sec lending margins. And so if you think about where we were at the outlook call and where the treasury curve was there and LIBOR was at that time, the drop in the treasury curve has been greater than that of the 3-month LIBOR. And so that inversion has occurred over the last 3 to 4 months, and that's put some pressure on us.  So overall, we think, certainly, the first one will we think reverse itself. We think of it as timing, and we'll have to monitor the margin pressure and sec lending and see what happens with the inversion of the curve. Right now if you follow the forward rates, it would imply that the relationship will improve throughout the year, but obviously, we know things can deviate from there.
Andrew Kligerman: Okay. So just staying with the bottom end of 100 to 125 basis points for the going forward versus 97 this quarter...
John McCallion: I would like to say bottom half.
Andrew Kligerman: Bottom half. Right. Right.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.
Jamminder Bhullar: I had a question just on group insurance margin. They were obviously a bigger source of the upside in earnings this quarter. To what extent do you think it's -- it was just good experience this quarter versus the trend, especially in the Non-Medical business being sustainable?
Michel Khalaf: Let me give you a couple of quick comments and then Ramy can chime in as well. So if you think, obviously, we're pleased with our group performance in Q1, and I'd say this is building also on strong momentum from last year, but we should keep in mind that underwriting results do fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. So if you think about life, for example, it's at the very low end of the range this quarter. Very much flu season was the main contributor.  But a few things I think related to what we discussed in the fourth quarter. One is that dental utilization has normalized so it's in line with expectations in Q1. As you recall, that was elevated in Q4. We said we didn't see signs of any trend. That was confirmed in Q1. And one of the things we did lower the Non-Medical Health ratio in our outlook call. That was driven by the view that disability is performing well given the healthy economy, the high levels of employment. So we continue to see positive outcomes there, but we also talked about the fact that we are seeing a business mix towards voluntary products, so with lower benefit ratios.  And we're particularly pleased, our sales results for the quarter, were very strong, and those were really driven by voluntary sales, so that's as opposed to jumbo sales, for example, which is also typical in national accounts. So I think this speaks to the fact that our strategy is delivering in terms of this product mix shift, and we think we continue to see voluntary as an important growth opportunity. I don't know, Ramy, if you want to also add to this.
Ramy Tadros: Sure, thank you, Michel. Good morning, Jimmy. Again, just to emphasize, you know that these ratios can be volatile quarter-to-quarter. And for the course of the year, I would guide you to the middle of our guidance range across both the mortality and the nonmedical benefit ratio. With respect to the latter, and particularly your specific question, what we saw in this quarter on the nonmedical benefit ratio, the ratio came at the lower end of the range, as you know, and that's largely driven by a combination of lower severity of claims as well as more favorable claims recoveries. As Michel mentioned, over the medium term as our business mix shifts, we expect to also be continuing some positive trends on this ratio.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore.
Thomas Gallagher: Michel, I'd just be curious on what your high-level thought is from the strategy standpoint. When I think of Steve and his legacy, I think it's risk reduction cash flow optimization. Are there any high-level issues that you would call out that you're focused on initially outside of those risk reduction or cash flow optimization?
Michel Khalaf: So look, I think we're on the right path in terms of core elements of our strategy, and you mentioned those, so capital efficiency, focus on strong risk-adjusted returns on strong free cash flow generation and profitable growth. And I can tell you that in all my visits to our key markets, I see a real focus on value creation that's now well embedded in pretty much everything we do. I do feel that we're at an inflection point. And while we've accomplished much in terms of our -- in terms of derisking action, I always believe that there's room for improvement. I've already started a review process with my team, and we are going to look for opportunities: one, to see how we can further optimize our portfolio, our products, our businesses, make sure that we are making -- we continue to make the right decisions and choices in terms of capital allocation; and then how we can also accelerate revenue growth, and as I mentioned earlier, make sure that expense efficiency becomes -- is more of a journey here as opposed to a single destination. So I'm excited. I think this is an exciting time for MetLife and I think we can -- I'm confident that we can build on the strong foundations that we already have.
Thomas Gallagher: Okay. And then just a follow-up on Group Benefits. It seems to me from what we're seeing in the industry that there's a lot more competition in voluntary benefits, you're seeing lapses escalating for certain carriers. It sounds like you're not seeing that. And you also -- John, I think you referenced Group Benefits sales up 11%, which is a good outcome. Can you talk sort of what you're seeing there competitively? Are there parts of the market that are getting heated from pricing or -- so anyway, yes. Any color you could give on that.
Ramy Tadros: It's Ramy Tadros here. So let me just give you some perspective on our voluntary strategy and the investments we've been making in that space over the last number of years, and they really fall in 3 categories. The first one is we were very early to recognize -- as you think about the voluntary space, this is not just about the traditional intermediaries and distribution channels. There's a whole benefit ecosystem that includes technology firms, benefit administrators, communication firms, and we've built an engagement model with each of those firms across the ecosystem.  We've invested in integrating our systems with them, and that creates seamless interaction and ease-of-use for both the employers and the employees. And then beyond that, once we get to the employee, we also have a lot of discipline in terms of driving employee engagement and education around voluntary benefits to build awareness and therefore increase the higher enrollment rates.  So what you're seeing here is the result of a very disciplined strategy with very focused investments that we've made over the last few years. From a competitive environment with respect to voluntary, we do see some carriers enter and they do try to compete on price to drive voluntary growth. I would say most of our growth that we've seen has actually come from expanding relationships with existing customers that value our brand and service and our ability to design flexible solutions for them. And then you're seeing a lot of growth, precisely from those investments that I'm talking about, that are driving enrollment and reenrollment rates, which enables growth outside of competitive bidding situations. And we're seeing very good bottom line results here and are very confident in the adequacy of our pricing in the voluntary space.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.
Erik Bass: For Asia, can you talk about how much runway there is to continue to grow sales of U.S. dollar-denominated products in Japan? And is this -- is the growth coming from kind of cash on the sidelines getting invested or money switching from other products? And just a little bit more color there would be helpful.
Kishore Ponnavolu: This is Kishore. As we discussed at the Investor Day last September, the low interest rate environment in Japan is a great fuel for the FX margin, right? That's driving a lot of customer demand across all of our distribution channels with our bank channel leading the way. In terms of our position, up until now we have been certainly expanding our share of the market. However, there are new entrants coming into that space. So if you think about this year, we had an 8% growth year-over-year, which is very, very strong.  Looking forward to the second quarter, that was a pretty strong performance last year. So year-on-year for the full year, I'm very comfortable with the guidance for the overall Asia sales of mid-single digits, but we're very, very happy with the progress we've made so far.
Erik Bass: And then for Latin America, can you just provide some more color on the earnings drivers this quarter and if there's any seasonality in terms of expenses or other items we can -- should consider when thinking about kind of the run rate going forward?
Óscar Schmidt: Sure. This is Óscar. So let me start referring to the comparison against prior year quarter. So first, expenses were higher year-over-year primarily due to a litigation reserve release in the prior year quarter, so this quarter reflects a more normal level of expenses. And the second is we had a positive investment performance, especially the Chilean Kihei, which performed above last year and above expectations this year. These 2 effects merely offset each other.  And finally, volume business growth year-over-year was mid-single digits. It was a bit lower than usual due to the loss of some Mexico federal government group cases but in line with our outlook whole discussion. But now let me refer to this quarter in particular against expectations. The way to look at it is that we have good cat results in Chile Provida but offset by a couple of old items. First, low quarterly inflation in Chile -- actually, inflation in Chile in the first quarter was almost zero, so that had an adverse impact the investments but in our life business in Chile as investment portfolio is indexed to inflation. That was the first impact related to low inflation in Chile.  And the second one is that low inflation also has an adverse impact on taxes in Chile, that's because inflation impact on equity is deductible for tax purposes. So we expect these two items to recover during the remainder of the year because the full year consensus in Chile remains almost similar to expectations, meaning that inflation that didn't happen in the first quarter will happen during the remainder of the year.  And finally, expenses were a little higher than expected in the quarter mainly due to some accounting adjustments that impacted expenses. So for the full year, we still expect our earnings to be in the range we provided on the outlook call on a constant currency basis. I hope this answered your question, Erik.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi.
Suneet Kamath: Just wanted to start with the RBC ratio. I think 402% is what you said, which is above your target of 360%. So would you expect -- I guess what I'm trying to get at is what is your expectations for dividends to the holding company in the balance of the year? Would you expect that excess to move to holdco or be consumed by growth in the business?
John McCallion: It's John. I would just -- I wouldn't comment specifically on dividend for a particular legal entity. I think we would just comment and refer back to the guidance that we've given, which is free cash flow ratio of 65 to 75 on average for the two year period. I think we're still on track to meet that target.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. And then I guess for Steve Goulart. On the balance sheet, we have seen some derisking activities from some of the other life insurers that have reported so far. So any color in terms of any changes you might be contemplating there? And should we be thinking about any of the interest rate hedges rolling off, either later this year or as we get into 2020?
Steven Goulart: It's Steve. Regarding portfolio repositioning, I think we've talked about this on the last couple of calls and I think indicated also, we would continue to look at opportunities that we thought made sense given our outlook in the market particularly in the credit market. And we've continued to do some repositioning into the first quarter, mostly looking at again sectors that we think would be vulnerable in a downturn. So we've continued to lighten up our bank loan portfolio as well as lower investment grade rated corporate bonds. A lot of them may be involved in M&A and higher leverage and the like. We think those are -- continue to be 2 vulnerable sectors in the market, and so that's where most of our repositioning has taken place.  And then regarding interest rates hedges and rolling off, again, I'd go back to how we think about all of our hedging policy in ALM, and it's always dynamic, and we will continue to review at that time and make the appropriate decisions then.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs.
Taylor Scott: First one I have is on MetLife Holdings. I'd just be interested if you had any commentary on what drove the sort of larger year-over-year decline in expenses, if there's anything specific related to the expense plan that occurred. And also on holdings, could you give us a rough way to think about statutory capital back in that segment?
John McCallion: It's John. On the first question with regards to expenses, yes, I think it's just been continued focus to optimize and the efficiency of that segment. We continue to focus there. And a lot of the efforts that we've been making over the years on our unit cost initiative, quite a few of that is allocated towards holdings so that's just kind of the natural progress that you would expect to see. Regarding allocation of capital, we haven't given that figure out, and we'll probably keep it that way for now.
Operator: And next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.
Humphrey Lee: Just to circle back on RIS. John, you talked about the investment spread and how it's being negatively affected by the inverted yield curve for the for the sec lending book. I think in the other call, you provided guidance in terms of sensitivity to LIBOR, but I was just wondering if you can provide some sensitivity in terms of how do we think about the impacts from the yield curve, especially coming from the longer end of the curve.
John McCallion: Sure. We did give a sense it should be the LIBOR. LIBOR in and of itself actually performed as expected. But as I said, there was -- we didn't talk about a shift in the shape of the curve relative to LIBOR. So that inversion -- maybe I didn't give this number before, but in the quarter, it probably cost us about 3 to 4 basis points on the spread. So if you roll that forward, you can kind of come up with what the headwind would be if the curve did not kind of steepen at all from here.
Humphrey Lee: Remind us what is the size of your sec lending book right now sitting in RIS?
John McCallion: We don't give that allocation out, but it's a good percentage of our sec lending goes there.
Humphrey Lee: Okay. Got it. And then a follow-up question related to the expenses. You've talked about this quarter, you have a little bit lower than expected, employee benefits and deferred comp flowing through the numbers. Can you give us a sense where the geography of those lower expenses are in the segments?
John McCallion: They're just allocated throughout segments. You can follow up with John later, but it's not -- it's -- -- they're out there. They're allocated throughout the segments, I guess, would be the easy answer.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. Mr. Hall, please continue.
John Hall: Great. Before we close, I'd like to turn the call over to Michel for some closing remarks.
Michel Khalaf: Thanks, John. Let me close by saying we are starting 2019 on solid footing with a strong fundamental first quarter. MetLife is a company with great businesses, a noble purpose and an iconic brand. Looking ahead, I'm excited and energized by the task at hand: delivering great value for our customers, shareholders and people. I want to thank everyone for joining us today, and I look forward to getting to know you better in the weeks and months ahead. Enjoy the rest of the day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-07 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife’s Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note on the forward-looking statement in yesterday's earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife’s fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Before starting, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released an expanded set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks, if you wish to follow along. The contents of the slides begins following the romanette pages that feature a number of GAAP reconciliations. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. But given the busy earnings call schedule this morning, we'll extend no longer than the top of the hour. So in fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. 
Steve Kandarian: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fourth quarter earnings to close on a very strong 2018. Quarterly adjusted earnings totaled $1.3 billion or $1.35 per share, up from $0.64 per share a year ago. Adjusted earnings benefited from a tax settlement that more than offset weaker capital markets, weaker underwriting and refinement to the estimated impact of U.S. tax reform. Net income was $2 billion or $2.04 per share, down from $2.14 per share a year ago. Falling interest rates, falling equity markets and the strengthening dollar drove substantial gains in the derivatives we hold to protect our balance sheet. These gains reversed much of the non-economic derivative losses incurred earlier in the year. For the full year 2018, MetLife generated adjusted earnings of $5.5 billion or $5.39 per share, an increase of 37%. Net income for the year was $5 billion or $4.91 per share. Overall, 2018 was an excellent year, driven by solid underwriting, good volume growth, disciplined expense management and tax reform. These positive fundamentals were enhanced by the impact of significant and consistent capital management. Reflecting the strong full year results, adjusted return on equity in 2018 was 12. 6%. Turning to total company investments. Our investment portfolio continues to benefit from higher investment rates. Our new money rate rose from 3.23% a year ago to 4.24% in the fourth quarter. Our average roll-off rate in the quarter was 4.4%. In absolute terms, recurring investment income was up 6.5% compared to a year ago as higher asset balances and rates combined to offset the roll-off of higher-yielding securities. Variable investment income of $237 million came in above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range and was aided by another strong quarter of private equity returns. For the full year, VII totaled $962 million at the upper end of our annual range of $800 million to $1 billion. Looking ahead, we anticipate weaker first quarter private equity returns in our alternative investment portfolio given fourth quarter marketing conditions and the one quarter reporting a lag. Our full year 2019 guidance for variable investment income remains unchanged. Before I address capital management, I want to provide an update regarding the group annuity issue we disclosed in December 2017. We continue to make good progress on the remediation of this issue and expect to report in our 2018 Form 10-K later this month, the lifting of the related material weakness. At the same time, we also expect to report the lifting of the previously reported material weakness associated with over-reserving in our Japan variable annuity book. Moving to capital management. When we held our outlook call in mid-December, I indicated that we have repurchased $700 million of MetLife shares since reporting earnings on November 1st, which extinguished our prior authorization and began utilization of our current $2 billion authorization. During the balance of December, we took advantage of market conditions and repurchased an additional $500 million at an average price of $39.46 per share bringing fourth quarter share repurchases to $1.2 billion. There remains $1.3 billion outstanding on our current authorization. All totaled we repurchased $4 billion of MetLife common stock and paid $1.7 billion of common dividends during 2018 to bring total capital return to common shareholders to $5.7 billion well ahead of our $5 billion target and more than 100% of full year adjusted earnings. By now it should be clear to all that we have a strong commitment to returning excess capital to shareholders. As this is my last earnings call before Michel Khalaf takes over as CEO, I have been thinking about what defines my time with MetLife. The one word that sums it up best is de-risking, whether on the asset side of our balance sheet, the liability side or in the regulatory arena. My goal is for MetLife to perform well in any economic environment. 18 months after joining MetLife as Chief Investment Officer in 2005, we sold Peter Cooper Village, Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan for $5.4 billion. While this was regarded as a historic top-of-the-market asset sale, it was actually de-risking move. That one property has risen so much in value that it represented nearly 50% of our entire real estate portfolio. The same approach to risk guided us as the storm clouds and the financial crisis began to gather. I am proud that we saw the housing bubble earlier than most and took action to significantly reduce our holdings to subprime mortgage-backed securities. We also saw the recession coming in October of 2007, two months ahead of the official call and made a decision to sell down approximately $8 billion of assets we thought would be most vulnerable in a downturn. Our efforts to de-risk MetLife's asset portfolio helped us come to the financial crisis in such strong financial shape that we were able to buy Alico from AIG for $16.4 billion, money that AIG used to repay U.S. taxpayers. When I became CEO in May of 2011, I knew our major task would be to de-risk our liabilities just as we had de-risked our assets. After going public, the company had been growing the topline with complicated guarantees that produced impressive GAAP earnings, but with poor underlying economics. We had exited the long-term care business the prior year, largely because some of our leadership view the liabilities ask unhedgeable. But we were still in danger putting a lot of value at risk in a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. Initially, I thought that exiting universal life with secondary guarantees and ratcheting down verbal annuity sales will get the job done. Eventually, we realized the best course will be to spin-off our U.S. retail business altogether and create two distinct value propositions. In light of these actions, I believe we have made tremendous progress in de-risking MetLife. At the same time, we were improving MetLife's economics by boosting free cash flow and the value of new business written. We expanded capital life businesses with high internal rates of return and shorter payback periods in fixed or exited businesses that fail to meet those criteria. As a result, our free cash flow ratio rose from 26% in 2012 to an average of 66% over 2017 and 2018. This stronger free cash flow enabled MetLife to repurchase more than $10 billion of common shares over the last five years even as we increased our common dividend at a 12% compound average growth rate since 2011. Operationally, we made significant investments to upgrade MetLife's technology, expand our digital capabilities, and deliver a better customer experience, all without negatively impacting expenses. To the contrary, our unit cost initiative has already improved MetLife's direct expense ratio by 140 basis points and is on track to deliver $800 million of pretax margin improvement by 2020. In the midst of all these efforts, we were confronted with a regulatory risk larger than any MetLife has faced in its history. Because we won our lawsuit against the government to shut our designation as a systemically important financial institution or SIFI, it may be hard to remember how ominous the threat appeared in 2013. The actions of the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Federal Reserve at that time, made two things clear, first, only three out of more than 800 U.S. life insurers will be labeled SIFIs; and second, the capital requirements for SIFIs will be significantly higher than for other firms. We view this as an existential threat that would make it impossible for MetLife to price many of its products competitively, harming customers and shareholders alike. The Dodd-Frank Act included a provision allowing companies to seek judicial review of their SIFI designations. No company wants to take the Federal government to Court, but this was a path I felt we must pursue for the sake of our customers, employees, and shareholders. We were given many warnings: you will lose, your brand will suffer, you will face retribution. But if anything, because we took the principal stand and fought for what we knew was right, MetLife emerged with its repetition enhanced. I believe I was the right person to lead the de-risking of MetLife, which has stabilized our balance sheet, strengthened our free cash flow and positioned us for a profitable growth. I also believe that MetLife is now at an inflection point, where a different kind of leadership is needed, someone with a strong track record of execution, who sets ambitious targets and knows how to meet or beat them. That person is Michel Khalaf and I'm very excited that he's taking over as CEO on May 1. The Board of Directors conducted a thorough internal and external search to find the right executive to lead MetLife. We knew it was critical to find someone who combine deep knowledge of the industry and entrepreneurial spirit, a commitment to innovation and strong leadership skills. The Board and I have every confidence that Michel is the right executive to lead our global company into the future. In closing, I want to thank everyone who has helped transform MetLife into a more efficient, innovative and financially successful company. This starts with MetLife's 48,000 employees, who bring a deep sense of purpose to our mission of making people's lives more financially secure. I also want to thank MetLife's senior leaders for their willingness to make hard decisions to move us forward. We have built one of the strongest leadership teams anywhere in the industry. I am confident they will lead MetLife to new levels of success. To my fellow Board members, I want to say thank you for your support, especially during our long SIFI struggle. Few Boards would have had the courage to stick with us through this challenge. I am very pleased that your trust was rewarded. And finally to our shareholders, thank you for your patience. Large life insurance companies are difficult ships to turn, but it was critical that we set MetLife on a better course for the future. As the owners of the company, you deserve a fair return on the capital you've entrusted to us. I believe our efforts are now delivering on their promise and will continue to do so in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion. 
John McCallion: Thank you Steve and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 4Q 2018 supplemental slides that we released last evening along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. These slides cover our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results. Starting on page four. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year 2018. In the quarter, net income was $2 billion, or roughly $700 million higher than the adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion. The primary driver for the variance was net derivative gains due to significant market movements during the fourth quarter. Lower interest rates, equity market weakness and the strength of the U.S. dollar combined to drive the net derivative gains. For the full year 2018, net income was $5 billion, which was roughly $500 million less than adjusted earnings of $5.5 billion. Overall, the results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. We had three notable items in the quarter as shown on page five and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. First, favorable tax items increased adjusted earnings by $247 million after tax or $0.25 per share. The largest component of this benefit was the result of an IRS audit settlement related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. As some of you may recall, MetLife established a reserve in the third quarter of 2015 related to this matter. Second, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $100 million after tax or $0.10 per share, which is the highest UCI expenses of the year. Third, litigation reserves and settlement costs were $60 million after tax or $0.06 per share. This includes separate fines, totaling approximately $20 million paid to the insurance Department of New York and the Securities Division of Massachusetts related to our group annuity business. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items were $1.2 billion or $1.26 per share. On page six, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 6% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency basis. On a per-share basis, adjusted earnings were up 14% and up 16% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall positive year-over-year drivers in the quarter included better expense margins and solid volume growth as well as lower taxes primarily due to the U.S. tax reform. These were partially offset by the impact from weaker equity markets, lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting. Pre-tax variable investment income was $237 million, up $21 million versus the prior year quarter, driven by higher private equity returns. With regards to our business performance. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were flat year-over-year. The key drivers were solid volume growth and lower taxes, which were offset by less favorable underwriting, higher expenses and lower investment margins. With respect to underwriting, the Group Life mortality ratio was 89.4%, which was higher than the prior year quarter of 87.2%, primarily due to elevated severity. Notwithstanding, this quarter's results the Group Life mortality ratio was 87.5% for the full year 2018 and exactly in the middle of our target range of 85% to 90%. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for non-medical health was 73.2%, which was lower than the 73.7% in the prior year quarter and below the 2018 target range of 75% to 80%. The year-over-year improvement in the ratio was primarily driven by continued positive trends in disability. This was partially offset by higher utilization in dental in the quarter. Group Benefits continues to see strong momentum in its top line. Adjusted PFOs in the quarter and full year were up 4% with growth across most markets and product lines. Full year sales were down 1% versus 2017, which had record jumbo cases. Voluntary products saw continued momentum with sales up double digits in 2018. In addition, we also continue to grow our market as regional and small-market sales were strong and well-above full year expectations. Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 51%. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and investment margins, solid volume growth, as well as lower taxes due to U.S. the tax reform. While the flatter yield curve has continued to pressure RIS adjusted earnings, this was more than offset by higher total liabilities which were up 5% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the FedEx transaction announced in May of 2018, total liabilities were up 2%. As a result of higher variable investment income in this quarter, we have been able to maintain spreads which were 130 basis points in 4Q 2018 and within our prior year outlook call range of 110 to 135. Excluding VII, RIS spreads were 103 basis points, down two basis points year-over-year and one basis point sequentially. RIS adjusted PFOs were $523 million, down from $1 billion in the prior year quarter due to lower pension risk transfer sales. While we did not complete any transactions in the fourth quarter, PRT PFOs were $6.9 billion in 2018, a record year for us. As we look to 2019, we remain optimistic on winning our share of PRT deals given the strong pipeline that we continue to see. Excluding PRT deals, adjusted PFOs were up 40% versus the prior year quarter and up 13% for the full year, primarily due to structured settlements and income annuities. Property & Casualty or P&C adjusted earnings excluding notable items in the prior quarter were up 13%, primarily due to lower taxes. Pretax cat losses were $25 million in the quarter which was $2 million lower than the prior year quarter. With regards to the topline, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 1%, while sales were up 13% versus 4Q 2017. Asia adjusted earnings were down 9% and 8% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were less favorable underwriting and the impact of weaker capital markets in Japan and Korea in the quarter. This was partially offset by solid growth in assets under management as well as lower taxes. Asia sales were up 5% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were up 19% primarily driven by strong foreign currency-denominated annuities as well as Accident & Health sales. FX and A&H products remain our primary focus in Japan and we continue to see strong momentum in the market. Other Asia sales were down 13%, primarily driven by regulatory changes in Korea. Latin America adjusted earnings were up 10% and 19% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were better expense margins, favorable underwriting, and volume growth. This was partially offset by the impact from a lower equity market on our Chilean encaje and higher taxes. Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 3%, but up 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth across the region. Latin America sales were up 6% on a constant-currency basis. The divestiture of MetLife Afore, our former pension management business in Mexico dampened sales growth by four points compared to the prior year quarter. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 30% and 24% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to less favorable underwriting and higher taxes. This was partially offset by better expense margins. In addition, EMEA's adjusted earnings were negatively impacted by a few one-time items totaling roughly $9 million that we don't expect to repeat. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 3% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting growth in Western Europe and Turkey. EMEA sales were down 7% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower volumes in the Gulf. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings, excluding notable items in 4Q 2017, were down 8% year-over-year. The primary drivers were unfavorable equity market impacts and life mortality. This was partially offset by improved expense margins and the benefits from U.S. tax reform. With regards to equity market performance, MetLife Holdings separate account returns were down 10% in the quarter and resulted in an initial market impact of approximately $25 million to adjusted earnings, which is roughly in line with our sensitivity guidance. Underwriting results included unfavorable mortality due to a higher large face claims in the quarter, which drove the life interest adjusted benefit ratio to 58%. Despite the higher life claims in 4Q, the full year interest adjusted benefit ratio was 52.4% excluding notable items and in the middle of our target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $132 million. Overall, the company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 12.2%. Excluding the favorable notable tax items discussed earlier, the company's effective tax rate in the quarter was 18%. Turning to page seven. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2018, as well as the quarterly details for 2018. As we have previously stated, we believe the annual direct expense ratio best reflects the impact on profit margins as it captures the relationship of revenues and the expenses over which we have the most control. We have also noted previously that our goal is to realize $800 million of pre-tax profit margin improvement by 2020, which represents an approximate 200 basis point decline from the 2015 baseline year. We continue to make consistent progress towards achieving our target by 2020. As the chart illustrates, we have already achieved 140 basis point improvement in the annual direct expense ratio from 2015 to 2018. While we are pleased with these results, we had certain expense items in the fourth quarter that lowered the full year ratio by approximately 20 basis points. We don't anticipate these items recurring in future periods. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on slide eight. Cash and liquid assets at our holding companies were approximately $3 billion at December 31, which is down from $4.5 billion at September 30. The $1.5 billion decrease in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, holding company expenses and liability management actions. Our average 2017 and 2018 free cash flow ratio was 66% of adjusted earnings excluding notable and Brighthouse separation related items. This was within our two-year average target of 65% to 75%. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, our new combined NAIC RBC target ratio post U.S. tax reform is 360%. And we will be in excess of that amount for the full year 2018. For our U.S. companies, preliminary 2018 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.4 billion. And net earnings were approximately $4.2 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $1 billion from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to dividends received from the investment subsidiary, which had a corresponding offset in statutory adjusted capital as well as lower taxes. These items were partially offset by less favorable capital markets in 2018 and reinsurance recaptures in 2017. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.5billion as of December 31, 2018, which remains relatively flat versus 2017. Net earnings and investment gains were offset by dividends paid to the holding companies. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 794% as of September 30th, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife generated a solid quarter despite challenging market conditions to close out a very strong year. Our full year financial accomplishments in 2018 include; 22% growth in adjusted EPS excluding notable items; record PRT PFOs of $6.9 billion; returned a record $5.7 billion of capital to shareholders; improved the direct expense ratio; and remained on track to achieve our target by 2020. In addition, our cash and capital position as well as our balance sheet remains strong. Finally, we remain confident that the actions we have taken to implement our strategy will continue to drive free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders. And with that, I will turn back to the operator for your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Q – Andrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning. Question around mortality. It looks like it was -- and you called that out in the press release as well. It looks like Group, Asia, EMEA, MetLife Holdings all had somewhat elevated mortality. So, I just wanted to get a sense. Is this kind of a blip? Could it reverse the next quarter? How do you see the outlook?
John McCallion: Good morning, Andrew. It's John. Let me take it from the top. I might ask Michel to jump in a little bit too on the group side. But I think in general what you said is true. I would consider this just normal volatility. I think the important thing to point out if you go back to our full year benefit ratios we're generally in line with our targets. So I would tend to agree with your -- I guess, your statement that this is just a normal volatility. It's generally severity in a lot of places. We did have a reserve refinement in Asia. I think the one place; we did see some higher utilization in dental. And maybe I'll just have Michel comment on that. So we'll monitor that. But I think otherwise the other mortality or unfavorable mortality is generally just considered a blip.
Michel Khalaf: Yes, hi Andrew. It's Michel. So, on the dental front, we did see higher utilization in Q4. As a reminder, we had a very strong first quarter. Typically, the fourth quarter, we see lower utilization. A lot of insureds reached their limit so that drives the overall utilization. As I said, we had low utilization in the first quarter. We've analyzed this; we see no particular trends in any block area or service. And some of the Q4 results are also due to prior quarter development as well. So, trailing from Q3. So, we're keeping a close eye, but nothing to suggest that this is the beginning of a trend.
Andrew Kligerman: Got it. And then just on the pension risk trends. You mentioned earlier John that the pipeline still looks very good. But it was quiet in the fourth quarter. Is it getting too competitive? Is pricing under any pressure here? Or do you feel good about the returns going forward?
Michel Khalaf: Yes, Andrew, Michel again. So, it is a competitive marketplace, but we see a good pipeline based on discussions that we're having with intermediaries and plan sponsors. We feel confident in our ability to continue to win our fair share of deals while sticking to our discipline in terms of how we evaluate and assess those opportunities going forward. So, we're still bullish and confident in terms of the PRT opportunity going forward.
Andrew Kligerman: Double-digit returns are still viable?
Michel Khalaf: Well, certainly we're sticking to our discipline in terms of the returns that we look for on those deals. And again, as a reminder, we had a record year in 2017 and we more than doubled 2017 and 2018. So, another record year there as well. So, yes, we're still sort of optimistic about the market opportunity there.
Andrew Kligerman: Excellent. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Good morning. Steve just a follow-up on your point on de-risking. As you think about how you leave Met position here, I think the perception is the only real remaining tail risk might be long-term care. And when you think about this risk going forward, while Met's block has performed pretty much better than everyone else in the industry so far, is there a risk that every block is underwater and eventually Met will -- it will catch-up to Met? Or do you have reason to believe that Met's long-term care block is going to be fine over the next several years?
Steve Kandarian: Hi Tom. We feel good about our long-term care block. And we talked about this; I think it was the last earnings call, gave you a fair amount of detail on it. We are getting rate relief in many states. We continued those efforts. As you know as most of this business is written on MOIC, that's under New York regulations which we had very strong capital rules and reserving requirements. So, we feel our book is in a good position. And we stopped writing this business back in 2010, as I mentioned. But obviously we still have a block of business on our books. And we still get premiums in for those policies that have been out there for quite some time. But we have looked at it very, very carefully. We've done a lot of work on it and we feel that it's in a good place.
Tom Gallagher: Got you. And then my follow-up is just on the Holdco liquidity and capital management. So looks like you're toward the low end of your Holdco liquidity target of $3 billion to $4 billion now. My question is, how much above the 360% RBC target are you in terms of stat surplus? And when you think about what your excess capital position is now, or maybe you don't have much of that excess capital, is there a thought for 2019 that you might want to build a bigger buffer? Or do you think you'll be able to use all of your free cash flow for 2019 for shareholder return purposes?
John McCallion:  Good morning, Tom. This is John. Let me take it from the Holdco and I'll touch on the RBC at the end. So first, let me just start to just help reconcile and maybe roll through – roll forward our cash from over the course of the quarter. I think it's important to recognize that we had 1.2 billion of share repurchase in the quarter. And I think you may realize that we had an additional 500 million post the outlook call. And I take that as a decision to accelerate some of what otherwise would've been repurchased in 2019. And we did so at an average price of $39.46. So, yes, we view that as good use of excess cash at that time given the work market weakness. And so we'll be mindful of that as we see how markets trend. I think the second thing to keep in mind in the quarter; we did complete our net liability management actions in the quarter. And just remind you, we said during 2018 that we would compete $1 billion to $2 billion of net liability management during 2018. We ended up at about $1.5 billion, which we completed in the fourth quarter. Roughly $400 million or $500 million of debt repurchases. And then I attribute the remaining portion to just lumpiness and any one quarter of intercompany cash flows and tax sharing payments. So then turning to the buffer. So we're at the low end of the range today. This process of setting the buffer, we use some severe and very severe liquidity stress tests. We look at the related calls on holding company cash and capital and then we set the buffer accordingly. And so we did so a number of years -- I guess, it was two years ago or so. We set the $3 billion to $4 billion range. And it's a range for a reason. So we take into account our outlook. And one of the things these liability management actions did is it helped reduce some of the complexity or the calls on cash at the holding company. We've historically run at about $1 billion of maturities every year in debt, debt maturities. And a lot of that liability management actions has helped push out some of those maturities. So just to give you a sense of that, we have no debt maturities in 2019. We have like $400 million to $500 million each year from 2020 to 2022. So our debt maturity towers are much different today. And as a result the holding company, under a stress, can be – can think about that.
Tom Gallagher: Right.
John McCallion: So it's just, we've kind of continued to reduce their risk, I'd say, at the Holdco. And therefore, I would expect us to manage to the lower end of that range in the near term. Moving to RBC. We did lower our RBC target as a result of the tax reform by 40 points. Remember it did not have any impact on our adjusted -- total adjusted capital. This was just merely impact to the formula for required capital. It doesn't change anything in terms of our available resources or anything like that. So we adjusted it down by the 40 points from 400 to 360. Today our best estimate that would be that we're above 380 at the end of the year.
Tom Gallagher: Got you. That’s helpful. Thanks. John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hi, thanks. Good morning. In Asia, the earnings this quarter were about $50 million lower than the full year quarterly average ex-notable items. I think John you mentioned reserve item. But I'm just curious if there's anything in the quarter you view as ongoing? Or if it was just a weaker quarter in terms of underwriting? And some of the other things you mentioned on capital markets and reserve true ups?
Kishore Ponnavolu: Ryan this is Kishore. For the full year 2018, if you exclude notables, the Asia segments reported adjusted earnings is up 8%. That certainly exceeds the outlook we provided for the year. In terms of this quarter there were four factors that put pressure on our earnings. One was unfavorable underwriting. And John spoke to the reserve refinement. That's about $20 million. There were two one-timers; one in the Japan segment, the other one was in the Other Asia segment. So that's first one. Then the second one is VII. Although VII was up for MetLife as a whole it was lower for the Asia segment by about $13 million. The third factor is the U.S. dollar strengthened in the fourth quarter against the Korean Won and the Aussie Dollar that -- about one point there. Finally, we had significant pressure on the equity markets in both Japan and Korea. Topics was down 18%, cost fee was down 13%. So this led to some reserve increases in some of various products. Just to give you a little bit of context around this, right? These reserves represent 2% of our total reserves. So that's point number one. And then point number two is in Korea, which represents a bulk of this impact, we are hedged on a statutory basis. So given all this and looking at 2019, I'm quite comfortable reaffirming our earnings outlook guidance. Thank you.
Ryan Krueger: Great. Thanks a lot. That was helpful. And then on the weaker VII in 1Q 2019 from lack of private equity returns, can you give us any quantification of that?
Steve Goulart: Ryan its Steve Goulart. Well, as Steve Kandarian said in his prepared remarks, we do expect the weaker first quarter; remember that's a lag in private equity. We've gone back and relooked at it. We looked at our outlook. What we've done, we have lowered our expected yield but it's still low-double digits as we said at the outlook call. And most important I think is we're still confident that our VII will come within the range that we gave at the outlook call off $800 million to $1 billion. Undoubtedly we'll be weaker. Private equity will be weaker in the first quarter reflecting the fourth quarter markets, but we're confident overall still.
Ryan Krueger: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jimmy Bhullar, your line is open. Check your mute button.
Jimmy Bhullar: Yes, hi. So I had a couple of questions. First on just as you mentioned new money yields going up throughout last year. And if you can talk about where your new money yield sit right now versus the rates that rates on the bonds that are holding off just to get an idea on if you're close to a point where you think spread compression will begin to abate in the business?
John McCallion: Well, if you look at the trend, the trend continues to be positive. And I think we've had four quarters in a row of rising new money yield. But remember what happened in -- sort of, late in the fourth quarter to rates have fallen again. Where we would stand though is we're still confident that as rates continue to rise, we're going to be approaching that breakeven threshold. But for now, we're still looking at kind of 25 to 100 basis point for each quarter just given the volatility in some of the runoff assets. But we're getting closer, we're not there yet.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on the international business, you've had sort of few dispositions recently with the Mexico Afore and the U.K. Wealth Management business. As you're looking at your international franchise overall, are there other pieces that you're looking to sort off deemphasize or are you comfortable with -- or is most of the restructuring effort already done?
Steve Kandarian: Jimmy, we can't say we can look at our overall portfolio businesses in terms of where were going to put more capital and where we're going to put less capital. And even in some cases as you've mentioned selloff or disinvest in those areas. So, that's an ongoing process. But if there's anything there that we come to conclude on, we'll certainly let you know.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then just lastly if I could ask on the MetLife Holding segment, the fact that a lot of the business is in New York, I think makes it difficult to sort of transact either insurer or sell it. Has anything changed the way you think that there's an opportunity for you to offload that exposure?
John McCallion: We are careful with that business, and its cash flow characteristics, but we always look at opportunities to create value for the shareholders. So, it's an area that we have spent a great deal of time looking at in the past and we continue to do so and we'll continue to do so going forward. If we find a way to transact in that area that's beneficial to our shareholders, we certainly will get give that full consideration.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Hi, thank you. I know you've touched on this part of the couple of the outlook pieces already. But I guess broader question. Is there anything on the 4Q results that changes your view on the 2019 outlook for any of the businesses? Or do you view all of the fluctuations this quarter as things that we would fall within your range of normal expectations?
John McCallion: Erik its John. Yes, that's correct. We would view this as this quarter -- this quarter does not impact our outlook for 2019. I think the only place I would just refer back to what Steve Goulart said is maybe there are some pressure on returns, but we think return for the year is still within our outlook range.
Erik Bass: Got it. Thank you. And then can you comment on the competitive dynamics in the group business and how they're affecting sales in persistency trends? Maybe how was your experience around the year on renewals?
Michel Khalaf: Sure. Erik, its Michel. So, it's a competitive marketplace I would say, in particular, in the dental space. But we are -- I would say, we are winning our fair share of business. I think 1/1/19 sales and renewals are in line with expectations. And we continue to see excellent momentum in our voluntary business as well. And that's really making up for some of the weakness that we see on the dental front, where we are really continuing to hold our ground in terms of discipline on pricing. But overall, I would say, sales and persistency are in line with expectations.
Erik Bass: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from UBS. Please go ahead.
John Nadel: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just a broader question, John. Capital markets impacts sort of broadly speaking in the fourth quarter. Do you have any estimate on what markets -- I mean, I know it was mentioned that Japan, Korea, obviously the U.S., etcetera. Can you just give us a sense for what kind of impact that had on your earnings in the fourth quarter? And how should we think about the 1Q balances that sort of go into your point of recovery?
John McCallion: Good morning, John. Yeah. As you said, there's been quite a bit of recovery already in the first quarter. I think we’re close to 9% year-to-date, something like that. And only 1 point off of where the S&P was at outlook call, I believe is correct. In terms of the – in the fourth quarter I would estimate the impact to be around $0.06. About half in the U.S. and half outside. So I don't know if that helps frame the fourth quarter. And then as you said, I think – but I don't see that impact continuing as our view right now, particularly given the recovery that we've seen so far. The only place that we would -- as Steve Goulart highlighted, there'll be some pressure in the first quarter that we think will – that we will recover and get to a return that keeps us within the range for the full year for PAI.
John Nadel: Okay. And then, maybe a little bit premature, but I guess a question for, Michel. As you're taking over the reigns, what are your priorities? And how should investors be thinking about those priorities? I know, Steve has characterized and thanked investors for some patience, given the transformation and some de-risking. How are you going to reward that patience as you think about priorities over the next one to two years? 
Michel Khalaf: Yeah. Thanks, John. So, first of all, let me say that I'm excited for the opportunity to lead MetLife. And continue degrade value for our customers and shareholders alike. Let me tell you what will not change under my watch and that's my commitment to MetLife's core goals of capital efficiency, strong risk adjusted returns and profitable growth. Like Steve, I believe that excess capital above and beyond what is required to fund organic growth belongs to our shareholders and should be used for share repurchase, common dividends, or if and when it makes sense, strategic acquisitions that clear our risk-adjusted hurdle rate. I believe that, as Steve said, MetLife is at an inflection point. And while much has been accomplished in de-risking our business, we still have work to do to accelerate revenue growth further optimize our business and product portfolios and strengthen expense discipline. Obviously, I'm now in a transition phase, so I look forward to share more post May 1st.
John Nadel: Appreciate that. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan, your line is open. Check your mute button. Okay, we'll move on. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott: Hi, good morning. First question I had was just on, when I think about the sales growth in Asia and the FX annuities you saw, could you talk a little bit about like what makes that product different from your decision to exit the retail annuities business in the U.S? I mean, clearly it's a different type of product, different regulatory regime, different geography. But I guess any color you can provide that would kind of give us more comfort that that product will ultimately have much better economics than the outcome when you are ramping up on sales of annuities in the U.S.?
John McCallion: Alex I know you were at the Asia Investor Day, and we went into this in fair amount of depth. And certainly these products from a risk-adjusted return perspective are very attractive. And then we talked about the compelling value proposition, not just from a customer perspective from a MetLife perspective as well, because much of these products go through the bank channel and a lot of them are single premium, a vast majority of our sales are actually single premium. And we take advantage of our strength, which is our investment in the U.S. dollar portfolio. We leverage that combined with our distribution power. That's driven been pretty much our success. And if you look at the category as a whole that's been growing and our share has been growing because we have a very strong value proposition. I talked about the market value adjustment feature, also talked about the constant repricing that we look at it pretty much on a biweekly basis. So this is a very actively managed portfolio. And we're very happy with that.
Alex Scott: Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up just on the U.S. group business. Can you give us an update on year-end renewals? Any insight on competition pricing et cetera?
John McCallion: As I mentioned earlier, very much in line with expectations. We're getting the renewal action that we are seeking in the market and persistency is in line with expectations. So it is a competitive market. And our pricing reflects that. But again nothing to point out in terms of deviation from what we expected or what we discussed on the outlook call.
Alex Scott: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Lee: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just a follow-up on Asia sales on different directions. In Other Asia you talked about the regulatory changes in Korea hurting your sales in that segment. But I assume you have -- your sales in China is probably better. So I was wondering if you can provide some color in terms of how much the challenges in Korea hurt your Other Asia sales and then also the other components of the other countries in the region in terms of your sales prospects?
Kishore Ponnavolu: Sure. Again if you take Asia segment as a whole, we've really done well, 11% year-on-year growth for Asia segment. Now, if you take the fourth quarter, Japan obviously, delivered a stellar performance, 19% year-on-year for the fourth quarter, 13% down on the Other Asia segment leading to a 5% overall growth that John mentioned where pretty much from all of it comes from the Korea shortfall. Certainly, we've got some smaller markets, but they are certainly growing healthy. No issues on China, China has, I think, posted strong growth as well. And the challenge with Korea is that one of our products which is our lead product has been impacted by the regulatory change on commissions where we're working very hard on repricing it and reintroducing it to the marketplace with additional marketing efforts. So, for looking forward to next year -- for this year, I think we'll be fine. I just wanted to reaffirm the outlook guidance of mid-single-digit growth for 2019.
Humphrey Lee: Thank you. And then shifting gear to Group Benefits, in the prepared remarks I think you talked about dental was a little bit unfavorable in the quarter. I guess that's a little bit surprising given the seasonality pan of that particular product line. I was just wondering if you can elaborate a little more in terms of what you saw in the fourth quarter.
Michel Khalaf: Yes. Sure Humphrey. So, as you said typically the fourth quarter, we see favorable utilization in dental because a lot of the insurers reached their maximum limits, which lowers utilization. However, this year, we had a very low first quarter, which typically tends to be high -- I mean 2018. So, that might have impacted the fourth quarter results. As I said, we've analyzed this; we see no issues with any particular block, service, or area here. So, this would indicate that this is not a beginning of trend, but we're obviously keeping a close eye on the situation.
Humphrey Lee: Thank you.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
John Barnidge: Your Property & Casualty business has meaningfully improved the underwriting. How much rate are you currently pushing on auto and also on home?
Michel Khalaf: Yes, hi John. We think that the industry as a whole has taken about 2% to 3% on auto over the last 12 months. We've taken slightly higher rate action than that. Going forward, we think that we're going to be more in line with industry. And I would say the same on homeowners. We think we're going to be in line with industry going forward.
John Barnidge: If you've been pushing more rate than industry previously and now you're going back to industry levels. Does that apply possibly greater share you're going to take or planning you're going to take?
Michel Khalaf: Well, we've -- in our outlook call, we provided -- we increased our outlook for PFO growth in 2019 to 2% to 4% and we think that's going to grow further to -- between 5% and -- over 5% in 2020 and beyond. We're also making important investments in our P&C business. We are re-platforming that business which -- and we are rolling that out in 2019 and 2020. So we think that that's going to give us also some competitive advantages in the market which will help our top line growth going forward.
John Barnidge: Great. Thank you for the answers.
Steve Kandarian: Thank you very much. That's our last question. We look forward to speaking with everyone throughout the quarter. Bye-bye.

Operator: Welcome to the MetLife's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time-to-time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factor section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.
John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2018 earnings call. On this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations' portion of MetLife.com, in our earnings release, and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released an expanded set of supplemental slides, including substantial disclosure in the appendix on our long-term care book of business. The slides are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to the main body of the supplemental slides in his prepared remarks, if you wish to follow along. The content for the slides begins following the romanette pages that feature a number of GAAP reconciliations. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend no longer than the top of the hour. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, in fairness to all participants. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife has been engaged in one of the most ambitious transformations in its history. For a number of years, much of our business was characterized by capital-intensive long-tailed liabilities with low levels of free cash flow. Our strategy has been to transform MetLife into a company with a different profile, less capital-intensive, with shorter payback periods, and higher cash flow. While some of the business we wrote in years past will take time to run off our books, we believe we are now at an inflection point where the heavy lifting of our transformation is just about complete. We are executing more consistently and the results in the quarter and for the year-to-date 2018 demonstrate that our strategy is working. We delivered third quarter adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.38 per share, up from $1.04 per share a year ago. Once again, our business fundamentals were strong: solid underwriting; good investment results; and disciplined expense management across the company. Reflecting our strong results, adjusted return on equity in the quarter rose to 12.9% from 9.1% a year ago. After notable items, adjusted earnings were $1.53 per share. Notable items in the third quarter included a net charge of $0.07 per share associated with our annual actuarial review and other insurance adjustments, as well as $0.09 per share of costs to support our expense initiative. MetLife's annual actuarial review, which we completed during the third quarter, examined the actuarial assumptions underpinning our insurance liabilities around the world. Going into the quarter, there was considerable market interest in long-term care. Our LTC review of all assumptions, models and the margin testing process, which incorporated a third-party actuarial review, concluded that no long-term care reserve unlocking was necessary. Following the review, our long-term care loss recognition testing margin now stands at $2.1 billion. Along with other insurance adjustments, the impact of the actuarial review on adjusted earnings was negative $68 million. The incremental effect of the actuarial review on net income was negative $230 million. None of these amounts were associated with long-term care insurance. The largest net contributors were assumption updates in Japan and the closed block. John McCallion will provide more detail on the actuarial review in his comments. Net income for the quarter was $880 million compared to a net loss of $97 million, which was driven by the separation of Brighthouse Financial a year ago. The largest items contributing to the difference between net income and adjusted earnings in the quarter, included net derivative losses in the annual actuarial review. Increasing net interest rates in the U.S. and Japan, a rising U.S. equity market and a weakening yen combined to generate mark-to-market derivative losses of $299 million, while protecting our balance sheet. As I mentioned earlier, the non-adjusted earnings impact from the annual actuarial review totaled $230 million. We continue to focus on delivering results where net income and adjusted earnings are more closely aligned than the past. Turning to business highlights, Group Benefits reported very good underwriting and solid volume growth, aided by the positive fundamentals of the U.S. economy. Retirement and Income Solutions also reported favorable underwriting and good volume growth. New pension risk transfer deposits in the quarter totaled $1 billion and we are seeing a strong pipeline. With Property & Casualty, lower catastrophe losses and volume growth contributed to solid adjusted earnings, which were up 69% year-over-year. For our international segments, Asia benefited from volume growth offset by less favorable underwriting. Latin America was aided by business growth, offset by currency headwinds. And EMEA benefited from expense management, while absorbing underwriting and currency weakness. Moving to total company investments, recurring investment income was up 6.7% from a year ago. Asset growth and higher interest rates account for the increase. In the quarter, our global new money yield was 4.04% in comparison to an average roll-off rate of 4.37%. Our new money rate was up 51 basis points from a year ago, reflecting higher interest rates. Pre-tax variable investment income totaled $280 million in the quarter, driven by strong private equity returns and higher prepayment activity. Pre-tax variable investment income is above our quarterly guidance range of $200 million to $250 million and on target to meet our full year guidance. Notwithstanding the recent market turmoil and concerns over geopolitical issues such as trade, MetLife's business growth has been helped by the favorable economic environment in the United States. GDP growth is on track to exceed 3% for 2018 and the U.S. unemployment rate in September dropped to the lowest level since 1969, a positive for our Group business. In addition, higher interest rates are strengthening our recurring investment yields. It is difficult at this stage to know that if stock market is signaling an economic downturn. But as we have said before, our refreshed strategy was designed to allow MetLife to perform well across economic cycles. Moving to capital management, we repurchased $636 million of our common shares during the third quarter. Combined with our common dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the quarter came to more than $1 billion. We have $470 million remaining on our current $1.5 billion authorization, which we expect to complete by year-end. Also, we announced last night that our board of directors authorized an additional $2 billion of share repurchases, bringing our current authorized buyback capacity to almost $2.5 billion. Over the three-year period from 2016 through 2018, MetLife will return close to $12 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and common dividends. During that same timeframe, our share count will be down by more than 10%. The cumulative impact of our share repurchase program has had a meaningful and growing positive impact on our financial metrics, including earnings per share and return on equity. In the current quarter alone, share repurchases contributed $0.08 to earnings per share compared to $0.04 a year ago. I would like to spend a moment talking about our Asia business. As many of you know, we hosted an Asia Investor Day in Tokyo at the end of September. Asia is our largest business segment outside the U.S. We have a strong franchise in the region, with a significant opportunity to generate growth and value for our shareholders. We have pursued a multi-year effort through Accelerating Value initiative to improve returns and capital efficiency. Among the more nimble actions was our transition from yen-denominated Whole Life products in Japan to dollar-denominated products. Importantly, this transition was aligned with our enterprise strategy to deliver the right solutions for the right customers. Over the past three years, MetLife has more effectively deployed capital in Asia at higher internal rates of return with shorter payback periods, which we expect will generate more value for our shareholders over time. As I noted at the start of today's call, this is the approach we are pursuing across the company. We believe the attributes of a new MetLife are becoming clearer; leaner; less capital-intensive; more digital; more profitable, with strong free cash flow. This is our plan to grow long-term shareholder value. And we believe the results are clear in MetLife's improved performance. On December 14, we will host our 2018 outlook call and share our three-year roadmap for MetLife. With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our quarterly financial results in detail.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 3Q 2018 supplemental slides that we released last evening, along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. These slides cover our third quarter 2018 financial results, including our actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments as well as business highlights. In addition, we are offering a deeper dive into our long-term care block, given its focus with analysts and investors. Starting on page 4, this schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net income was $880 million, or roughly $500 million below adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. The primary drivers for this variance were net derivative losses and the non-adjusted earnings impact from the actuarial assumption review. Higher interest rates, strong U.S. equity markets, and the weakening of the yen combined to drive the net derivative loss. Overall, the results in the investment portfolio and hedging program performed as expected. Now, let's turn to page 5. We have completed our annual actuarial assumption review during the third quarter. Before I speak to the total review, I would like to first address the review as it pertains to long-term care. During the quarter, our actuarial team reviewed all LTC assumptions, models, and the loss recognition testing process. Our review was supplemented by a third-party actuarial review. The short-form conclusion was that no long-term care reserve unlocking was needed. We continue to have a substantial loss recognition testing margin associated with long-term care. As of September 30, this was $2.1 billion. In addition, we increased the amount of disclosure regarding our long-term care block of business. The disclosure can be found in the appendix to the supplemental slides. Along with the granular detail on the long-term care block, we have provided the assumptions underlying our base GAAP and statutory reserves, as well as the assumptions supporting our GAAP loss recognition testing and our statutory asset adequacy testing. Further, we provided a set of sensitivities associated with our GAAP loss recognition testing margin. Keep in mind that MetLife is not in loss recognition, so our LTC sensitivities relate to our loss recognition testing margin, rather than our base reserves. Following the review, we continue to reflect improving morbidity in our loss recognition testing assumptions at a rate of 50 basis points per year. This judgment is supported by a third-party review of our actual morbidity experience, which is tracking at an annual rate of improvement of roughly 2%, more than the assumed rate, but still building statistical significance. It is important to note the removal of this assumption would be fully covered by our loss recognition testing margin. Our statutory long-term care reserves total $14.7 billion. They do not assume any improvement in morbidity in the formulation of base reserves or in the statutory asset adequacy testing process. Our statutory LTC reserves are $2.6 billion greater than our GAAP LTC reserves, which speaks to the strength of the protection provided to our long-term care policyholders. We take in roughly $750 million of long-term care premium each year, which is an important contributor to reserve growth and loss recognition testing margin over time. Importantly, premiums grew last year by 7% from rate increases. And we've achieved another 3% in rate increases year-to-date, which serves to better support our LTC block of business. I will now briefly discuss the balance of our actuarial assumption review on page 6. During the quarter, the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments reduced adjusted earnings by $68 million. There were a number of pieces that were largely offsetting and each segment was modestly impacted. Among the larger contributors were: lapse assumption updates in Asia and MetLife Holdings; as well as mortality updates; closed block refinements; and other life insurance reserve adjustments in MetLife Holdings. The non-adjusted earnings portion of the assumption review was a negative $230 million and was driven by some of the same factors. We had two notable items in the quarter as shown on page 7 and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. First, the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments decreased adjusted earnings by $68 million after-tax, or $0.07 per share. Second, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $88 million after-tax, or $0.09 per share. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $1.5 billion, or $1.53 per share. On page 8, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items, by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 29% year-over-year and 32% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 39%, and up 40% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers in the quarter included: favorable underwriting; solid volume growth; better expense and investment margins, as well as lower taxes primarily due to U.S. tax reform. With respect to investment margins, pre-tax variable investment income was $280 million, up $44 million versus the prior-year quarter, driven by higher private equity and prepayment income. With regards to business performance, Group Benefits adjusted earnings, excluding notable items in both periods, were up 38% year-over-year, primarily driven by: favorable underwriting margins; volume growth; better expense margins; and the benefit from U.S. tax reform. Underwriting results were particularly strong in non-medical health. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for non-medical health was 68.1% and 71.6%, excluding a favorable insurance adjustment. This result was favorable to the prior-year quarter of 74.7% and well below the target range of 75% to 80%. Non-medical health's favorable underwriting experience was primarily driven by disability, which had strong renewal results, lower incidence and favorable claim recoveries versus the prior-year quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio was 85%, which was in line with the prior-year quarter and at the low end of the target range of 85% to 90%. Group Benefits continues to see strong momentum in its top line. Adjusted PFOs were up 6% year-over-year, with growth across all markets and product lines. Year-to-date 2018 sales were down 2% relative to the first three quarters of 2017, which had record jumbo cases. Voluntary products continued its momentum, with sales up double digits year-to-date in 2018 versus the prior-year period. In addition, we also continue to grow downmarket, as regional and small market sales were strong and above our year-to-date target. Adjusted earnings in Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, were up 37%. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and volume growth, as well as lower taxes due to U.S. tax reform. This was partially offset by investment margins, as we had lower variable investment income in RIS compared to the prior year. While the flatter yield curve has put some pressure on RIS adjusted earnings, this was more than offset by higher general account balances, which were up 7% versus the prior-year quarter. In addition, we have been able to maintain investment spreads, which were 125 basis points in 3Q and within our outlook call range of 110 to 135. As we noted on our 2Q analyst call, earnings from interest rate caps contributed to spreads once again in the quarter. Excluding VII, RIS spreads were 104 basis points, which was up 5 basis points year-over-year, but down 9 basis points sequentially. RIS adjusted PFOs were $1.7 billion, down from $2.5 billion in the prior-year quarter, due to lower pension risk transfer sales. Year-to-date, PRT sales are well ahead of 2017. And we continue to win deals, highlighted by two transactions in 3Q 2018 totaling $1 billion. Excluding PRT deals in both quarters, adjusted PFOs were up 2% year-over-year, primarily due to structured settlements and income annuities. Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items in the prior-year quarter, were up 41%, primarily due to lower catastrophes in the current quarter. Pre-tax cat losses were $49 million in the quarter, which was $37 million lower than the prior year. With regards to the top-line, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 2%, while sales were up 23% versus 3Q 2017. We continue to see strong sales momentum in 2018. Asia adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 11% and up 12% on a constant currency basis. The key driver was volume growth, which was partially offset by less favorable underwriting. Asia sales were up 29% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were up 38%, primarily driven by strong foreign currency-denominated annuities, as well as Accident & Health sales. FX in A&H products remain our primary focus in Japan and we continue to see strong momentum in the market. Other Asia sales were up 16%, primarily driven by China and a group case in Australia. Latin America adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were down 4%, but on a constant currency basis were up 4%. The impact from U.S. tax reform has dampened Latin America earnings. For example, if we exclude notable items and the impact of tax reform, Latin America adjusted earnings were up 3% and up 13% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were solid volume growth, higher interest margins, and favorable underwriting. Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 1%, but up 7% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth across the region led by Chile. Latin America sales were up 2% on a constant currency basis, due to higher direct marketing and group sales. EMEA adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were down 1%, but up 5% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to expense margin improvement. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins. EMEA adjusted PFOs were flat versus the prior year and up 3% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth in Western Europe and Turkey. EMEA sales were down 22% on a constant currency basis, due to lower volumes in the Gulf and the exit of the UK wealth management business in mid-2017. MetLife Holdings' adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 45% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting, improved expense margins, and the benefits from U.S. tax reform. With regards to underwriting, LTC was favorable versus the prior year quarter and remained consistent with expectations as we continue to execute on our rate action plan. MetLife Holdings' adjusted earnings were aided by several items in the quarter of approximately $30 million, which are not expected to repeat. Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $149 million compared to an adjusted loss of $152 million in 3Q 2017. The primary drivers were higher variable investment income and favorable expense margins. This was mostly offset by the impact from U.S. tax reform and lower interest margins. Overall, the company's effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.2%. Excluding a positive one-time tax item of $12 million, the company's effective tax rate was 17.9%, a fraction below our guidance of 18% to 20%. Turning to page 9, this chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2017, as well as the first three quarters of 2018. As we have stated previously, we believe this ratio best reflects the impact on profit margins as it captures the relationship of revenues and the expenses over which we have the most control. We have also noted that we need to bring down our direct expense ratio by approximately 200 basis points from 14.3% in 2015, which was the baseline year, to realize $800 million of pre-tax profit margin improvement. For this quarter, the direct expense ratio was 13.1%, excluding notable items and pension risk transfers. This is modestly higher than the first two quarters of 2018. As we have previously mentioned, we would expect our direct expense ratio to tick-up slightly in 4Q given business seasonality, but anticipate the full year direct expense ratio falling below the 2017 ratio of 13.3%. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at September 30, which is down from $5.4 billion at June 30. The $900 million decrease in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, holding company expenses and liability management actions. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date third quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.6 billion and net earnings were approximately $3.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $1.1 billion from the prior-year period, primarily due to dividends received from an investment subsidiary which had a corresponding offset in statutory adjusted capital, as well as the positive impact of U.S. tax reform. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18 billion as of September 30, 2018, down 3% compared to December 31, 2017. Net earnings were more than offset by dividends paid to the holding company and by investment losses. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 808% as of June 30, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife generated another very strong quarter in 2018, driven by solid business fundamentals. The highlights in 3Q included favorable underwriting, volume growth and improving margins. In addition, our cash and capital position, as well as our balance sheet, remain strong. Yesterday's announcement of a new $2 billion buyback authorization is further evidence of MetLife's financial strength and our commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders. Finally, we remain confident that the actions we are taking to implement our strategy will drive free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question on Group Benefits. The underwriting performance has been very strong this year, for both MetLife and pretty much the entire industry. Can you give us some additional perspective on what you're seeing and, I guess, if we continue to stay in a good economic environment, if you think results can continue to trend more favorably than you would typically expect longer term?
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, hi, Ryan. This is Michel. So, as Steve mentioned in his opening, obviously, the favorable economic environment does help in terms of the underwriting performance. If you think about disability, for example, where we've seen very good results this quarter, lower incidence, high recovery experience. So that's one factor. We always like to be cautious and guide towards the range that we provide for our underwriting experience, but we do think that some of the benefit could be sustainable. I would also point out that if you look at our results over the last three quarters, the diversity of our business is an important factor. In the first quarter, our dental performance was strong. Q2, life underwriting was strong. Q3, disability in particular, but also if you look at our life mortality, it's at the lower end of the range. So we think some of this is sustainable. I would also point out in non-medical health, in particular, that our shift towards voluntary benefits, accident & health, in particular, should over time also help lower our benefit ratio there.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. And then, just one on the interest rate caps in retirement, John, could you give us some kind of perspective on just how much that's contributing right now to spreads, so we can think about the impacts when it runs off?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Sure. So as I said last quarter, our interest rate caps, given where LIBOR is today, is providing a offset. And it's effectively neutralized the sensitivities we gave back in December of last year in terms of the outlook call. And I think the other aspect, we also said there were certain management actions we took in terms of how we manage the liability side of the balance sheet as well. So the combination of those has probably helped us in, call it, the 5 to 7 basis point range.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Good morning. Just a few long-term care questions, can you comment on what's going on with underlying long-term care claim trends? I know, John, you had mentioned you're seeing favorable experience. That probably puts you in the minority in terms of from everyone else we're hearing from on underlying claim trends. Is it frequency, severity, claim durations? Can you give a little color in terms of what you're seeing on the claims side?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yes, sure. I would probably just keep it pretty simple. I don't know if we're seeing favorable. I'd say they're in line with expectations. And I think just overall, the underwriting profit in the business is performing as expected. I'm not so sure I'd say they are favorable relative to expectations.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Okay. And then, just on the disclosure that you put out for long-term care, I guess a few things that stand out is the fact that you're not in loss recognition testing and your loss recognition testing margin is over 10%. But is there anything other than those that you would point out that you feel like where your block stands out is less risky or in better shape than others?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yes. I think I would probably reiterate things we said in the past. We believe the profile of the block is in decent shape. Obviously, our relationship of group to individual, the amount of lifetime benefits we have, things like that and kind of things we've reiterated before. And then, I'd say the second thing that we talked about is just the work we've done on rate increases over the years has been beneficial. We have $750 million of premium in this block that we receive every year. We got a 7% increase last year. We've got another 3% through nine months this year. So, I think those probably at a high level are the two factors I would point to.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. I just had a question on your expectations for spreads, given what's happened with rates. Where do you think rates need to go for spread compression to sort of cease? And then if you could quantify how much of a benefit you are getting from interest rate protection and any color on how these expire over time?
Steven J. Goulart - MetLife, Inc.: Hey, Jimmy, let me take the first one. This is Steve Goulart. And we'll just talk a little bit about spreads. Steve gave some of the statistics for what's happening in our overall portfolio. We've talked a lot in the past about the roll-off reinvest dilemma and we continue to see that spread narrowing as we see interest rates climbing. That's the outcome that we expected and obviously an outcome that we're very pleased to see happening. So, we continue to see that happening. I think if we see interest rates behave as, say, the forward curve or our plan projects, we continue to see that gap narrowing and I think it's favorable. I think I'd even go so far as to say that in several quarters, we're likely to basically be at breakeven.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: And, Jimmy, this is John. I'll take the second one. So, I would probably go back to the response to Ryan's comment. So, we certainly have some interest rate caps today, given where LIBOR has rose to and it hasn't changed much in the last three months. Those caps we have that are giving that protection today and really neutralizing the sensitivity in our RIS business, they will roll-off into the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2019. Now, we have other caps in 2019, although they're at higher strikes. So, I think what we'll do on the outlook call is work through it and maybe a more robust sensitivity for you as we think about the outlook.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And your comments on spreads maybe neutralizing or spread compression neutralizing sometime in the next several quarters, does that take into account the expiration of the caps?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Right, so...
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Or is that just a differential between portfolio yields and maturing or new money versus maturing loans?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yes. So, spreads, I'm focusing on RIS right now.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: And we gave a sensitivity in the outlook call last December that indicated with a rising LIBOR rate, that we would have a negative spread compression. And what I'm saying is that the caps, given how fast or how high it has risen, it's some of these out of the money caps are now in the money and they are neutralizing that sensitivity. So, we are not seeing that negative spread compression as a result of the caps and how high LIBOR has risen. That will roll-off, all else equal, in the next few quarters and then we'll have to give you an updated outlook for that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, morning. First question is on the direct expense ratio. And it looks like you have another, I don't know, 80-plus basis points, 100 basis points to go that would be about $400 million. And this quarter, you spent $88 million on expense cost initiatives. If the plan is to complete the direct expense ratio reduction in two years, could you talk about the geography of where you're going to see it, the timing of when we're going to see it? Are we going to actually see $400 million drop to the bottom-line?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Right. So, I would just reference back to the direct expense ratio slide. We've used a ratio. We believe that using the ratio of revenues to our fixed cost is an indicator of profit margin expansion. So I would argue that we have seen that already, but not all of it yet. Our target is to get to a net $800 million (39:38) by 2020. So that's roughly a 200 basis point reduction using the same revenues we have today. So I think the answer is yes. We expect to see that drop to the bottom line. And the reason we put the ratio out is to provide a metric that you can track to see that that has actually happened.
Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So we'll see it within two years. And any particular areas of the company where it will benefit most?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: We're focusing on our fixed costs across the firm. And it's everyone's contributing. This is a full team effort. We are obviously having to leverage and our goal here is not just to kind of do these things and then see expenses creep back up. This is a unit cost initiative. Our objective is to improve this direct expense ratio by 200 basis points and keep it there.
Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. And then...
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: And to do that, we're making quite a bit of investments around technology to build the platform to leverage that operational leverage.
Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it, thanks. And then, lastly on share repurchases, you've done $2.8 billion year-to-date. Now you've upped the authorization and you have about less than $2.5 billion on it, which is terrific. Do you think you'll do this over the course of now through 2019? Will it all get deployed?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yes. Our objective is to finish the remainder on the $1.5 billion authorization, which we will do by no later than end of the year. And then we'll reevaluate along the way. I think it's fair to say that the $2 billion would be done no later than end of year next year.
Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Terrific. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. And thanks for all the long-term care disclosures. That was helpful. In terms of the loss recognition testing assumptions, did you make any changes to those underlying assumptions as you went through this third quarter review?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, hi, Suneet, it's John. Yeah, we did make a few changes. So we dropped our ultimate lapse assumption roughly 20 basis points in the aggregate. We were at roughly 1% before. We're down to 80 basis points now. We probably made some changes to utilization, but it varied by block and so there was really probably nothing material in aggregate, but we did make some changes throughout. And I think other than that, those are probably the most material changes.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So that $2.1 billion margin, there is no big change to that in the aggregate?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: I would say not material. Yes.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then my quick follow-up is just on the morbidity improvement. I think you said in your prepared remarks that you're seeing maybe 2% morbidity improvement, which, again, is quite a bit different from what we're hearing from other companies. So any sense of like how much claims experience you've seen so far maybe relative to inception, and any sense in terms of why you're seeing it versus perhaps some other companies that aren't seeing it yet?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yes. I think I would reference, we still are building statistical significance in the data. So it's still relatively early. I don't think we could draw a conclusion that would cause us to change our current assumption. But what we're saying is early signs are indicating that it's higher than that. But we need to see the data emerge and kind of build that statistical significance, as I mentioned. It's hard for me. I'm not going to speculate as to why we're seeing it and others are not. But I think it's important to leverage your own data and make the appropriate conclusions off of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from UBS. Please go ahead.
John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC: Hi, hey, thank you. Good morning. I guess a couple questions, just thinking about favorability of underwriting results. And I guess in particular on the group side, if you could characterize what portion of better results this quarter, you think, is just akin to more typical seasonal pattern. 3Q, I think, tends to be a little bit better anyway. And how much of that is more difficult to think about trending? And then the second part of the question is just to think about January 1, 2019 renewals. I think there's been an expectation that maybe the positive impact of tax reform and maybe some of the good underwriting results we've seen would maybe put some downward pressure on premium rates for renewal business heading into 2019. And can you sort of talk to what you're seeing, if anything, in that respect.
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, hi, John. This is Michel. So if you think about our favorable underwriting results in the quarter, we mentioned disability. We had favorable renewal results, lower incidence and more favorable claim recovery experience. As I mentioned earlier, the healthy economy may be a contributing factor to this. So certain aspects of that we think are sustainable. I also mentioned that as we continue to shift our business mix more towards voluntary, we are likely to see over time improvements in our non-medical health benefits ratio. So those are some elements. I should point out here that the return of the health insurance tax, the HIT, in 2018 that was out in 2017. It's back in 2018. It will be out again in 2019. It will create some volatility that helps our non-medical health benefit ratio in 2018. So those are some of the elements that I will point out to. And on the life side, we mentioned that mortality was at the low end of our guidance range for the year. We think we'll be within that guidance range. With regards to January 1, 2019, so what I'll say first is that we are, so far, pleased with our renewals and sales and the large case segment for January 1, 2019, where most of the renewals and sales are already done. I think those are in line with expectation. We are winning our fair share of new sales and we are renewing in accordance with expectation. Too early to tell, as far as the med and lower end of the market, but we continue to see very good momentum on the voluntary front. And we think that will continue into January 1, 2019. As far as the competitive environment is concerned, we are seeing a aggressiveness, particularly in dental, I would say, somewhat in disability. But we continue to be able to compete, especially that we focus on customers and intermediaries that look beyond just the lower price and where our service capabilities, our product set are major factors in our ability to win.
John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you for that. I mean, if I could just sort of follow it up with what I think is my takeaway from your commentary, Michel. It sounds like we really shouldn't expect any significant difference or shift in margin for the business based on 2019 pricing, really more just the function of overall economic conditions. Is that a fair summary of your comment?
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: Yes. I mean, I think that the tax will impact the dental business in particular, but other than that, yes, I would say you're spot on.
John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. I guess the first question I had was just on MetLife Holdings, any color you can give around the life business, variable annuities? I guess, in particular, on the life side, if any of the action from reinsurers and repricing is impacting you guys at all? And then on the variable annuity and fixed annuity side, if there's anything you learned through the actuarial process or just the experience that you can provide color on.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Hey Alex, it's John. So, on the first one, I'd say no, nothing material that we're seeing in terms of the reinsurance pricing question you had. In terms of the actuarial review, look, as we said before and you saw on the supplemental slide, it's a variety of things and that's no exception for MetLife Holdings. Actually, the largest item in there is the closed block. It was about half of it. And we just had update to our estimated gross margins and that had an impact on DAC that came through. So, it's a little over half of the actuarial update there.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then maybe just one quick one on LatAm, I think the growth rates on premiums have been sort of hitting your guide. This quarter, it was a little lower. Any kind of update around how you view that mid to high single-digit growth rate and sort of the impact that the political landscape's having across some of those geographies.
Oscar Schmidt - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, Alex, this is Oscar. So, let me start with premiums and fees. So, we have a 7% growth year-over-year on constant currency. But you need to consider the divestiture of our Afore in Mexico a year ago. If you adjust for that, it's one percentage above, which is 8% year-over-year, which we find good according to our expectations. If you go to sales, sales was also affected by the divestiture of Afore, but in this case, it's four percentage points. So, if you adjust for that, our sales growth is approximately 6% year-over-year on constant currency, which we find good. Remember that our top-line growth, our revenue growth, for us, it's a combination of sales as well as higher persistency. We're putting a lot of attention on persistency. Now, your second question is about the political landscape. So, I guess, let me answer two-fold. The two countries are weaker more on Chile and Mexico. Chile, the President announced last Sunday, the project for pension reform. We find it very positive in terms of reaffirming the system, reaffirming the private system, the AFPs in general. Now, obviously, this is going to take time, we think probably more than a year. The conversion or process may be 1.5 years. So it's going to be a long process, but this is the first obviously signed development in the Congress. We think it's a good project. (5:41) Going to Mexico for a minute. In terms of the change in government, as you probably know, the new administration has been focused on fiscal discipline, which we find very positive in general terms. And as part of that, they are planning to reduce government spending. And that includes a reduction of benefits in particularly high senior officers in the government. And, as you know, we provide some solutions that we inherited from the acquisition of Hidalgo more than 15 years ago. So, we think that it's something worth managing. But, as you know, those contracts have been subject to bidding process over the years. We've lost some. We recovered some. At this point in time, if you want to put a value to this, we think that the federal contracts that may be affected by the government account for less than 5% of LatAm earnings. And, of course, we are working to protect, mitigate that and we think it's going to be lower than that potentially.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I have a question related to the unit cost initiatives. So you have $184 million spent year-to-date on an after-tax basis or maybe roughly $230 million pre-tax. I'm just trying to see if you are still on track to your $330 million pre-tax target for the full year of 2018?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yes, we are, Humphrey.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Okay. And then a quick question for Michel, just to follow-up on the group pricing, you've talked about dental a little bit aggressive and then so is disability. I was just wondering for that aggressiveness, is it aggressive but rational or you are seeing some irrational behavior in the marketplace?
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, hi, Humphrey I think you always do see one or two carriers that are overly aggressive, potentially irrational. That's not unusual. We continue to be disciplined in our approach, selective in avoiding situations where pricing is overly aggressive. So that's been our approach and will continue to be our approach, but there is irrational behavior from time-to-time and, in particular, in dental.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thank you very much. I was curious about what kind of deployable cash you have on hand right now, the pace of dividends that will come from the subs over the next year. And if we can look out a year or two in advance if your financial leverage is going to change with the buyback.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Hey, Joshua, this is John. I would just reiterate our outlook guidance around free cash flow. It's 65% to 75% over the average of two years. So I would say there's no change to that. In terms of leverage, we've done quite a bit of delevering to-date. The guidance we had given was for 2018, we had net liability management of $1 billion to $2 billion, would take effect this year. We've done about $1 billion and we'll reevaluate whether we do any additional delevering to give ourselves some additional financial flexibility.
Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And in terms of cash on hand right now?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: $4.5 billion as of September 30.
Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you,
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
Randy Binner - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. This is actually picking up on Suneet's line of questioning. And the question is your view as a market leader on how this body of industry data and assumptions is coming together around long-term care disclosure. Your disclosures are good. And we're getting much more granularity and sensitivity from all the carriers. But I'm just curious if you have a view on kind of the progress and quality of the disclosures we're getting. And I think it's important what your view is, because this is become a gating factor for a lot of investors looking at the space. So just want to get your view on how you think the kind of body of industry disclosures coming together on long-term care?
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: This is Steve speaking. It's difficult for me to opine on other people's processes, but we certainly looked at this very, very carefully. As we mentioned in our comments this morning, we brought in an outside actuarial firm to review what we were doing. We wanted to make sure we had access to benchmarking from others. We looked at our models. We made sure they were validated. And we examined all of our actuarial and morbidity trend experience and so on. So we know the sensitivity around this issue in the industry with investors, with analysts and that's why we spent the extra time and effort, both internally and bringing an external firm to validate all these measures.
Randy Binner - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: I mean, with that external firm, is your sense that you're conservative to what has become the industry baseline or just are more in line with it?
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: I'm not going to opine on as to others, but I'll simply say that we benchmarked against others in terms of our own assumptions to make sure that what we were using was appropriate.
Randy Binner - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Thank you. Japan annuity sales essentially doubled in the quarter and has been a material grower recently. Can you talk about why you're comfortable with pricing of that product? Is there something like where participants have exited and you're filling a role and where is the share coming from? Thank you.
Kishore Ponnavolu - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, this is Kishore Ponnavolu. If you look at our annuity sales, they're up 91% quarter-over-quarter. And you take the annuity sales and break them out, single premium sales account for 80% of the overall sales. And then, also, the growth rate for single premium is much higher, at least in this quarter, than level premium. And so, let's spend a little bit time about on the single premium products per se. These are five and 10-year products, tightly duration matched. So, if you look at the ALM risk, there's nothing there. And also, these are foreign currency products. So, these are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated, where we have considerable experience in terms of investment for matching liability. These policies also have an MVA and that certainly ensures that there's appropriate risk sharing from market risk perspective. So, overall, we are very comfortable with these products.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions.
John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.: Great, that brings us to the top of the hour. Thank you, everyone. We look forward to speaking with you on December 14 for our annual outlook call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factor section of the filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2018 earnings call. On this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released an expanded set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. The content of the slides begins following the romanette pages that feature a number of GAAP reconciliations. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that given the busy earnings call schedule this morning will extend no longer than the top of the hour. So, in fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one followup. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion or $1.30 per share, up from $1.04 per share a year ago. Overall, it was another strong quarter in 2018, driven by solid underwriting and expense management across the company. Reflecting the strong results, adjusted return on equity in the quarter was 12.2%. After notable items, adjusted earnings were $1.36 per share. The only notable item in the second quarter was cost incurred to support our unit cost initiative, which totaled $0.06 per share. Net income for the quarter was $845 million compared to $865 million a year ago. During the second quarter, MetLife successfully divested its remaining equity stake in Brighthouse. Included in second quarter net income is a realized loss on our disposed Brighthouse shares, as well as other transaction costs, which, together, totaled $212 million. These items represent the largest portion of the difference between net income and adjusted earnings in the quarter. We are focused on delivering results where net income and adjusted earnings track more closely than in the past. Turning to business highlights. Both Group Benefits and Retirement and Income Solutions reported good volume growth and solid underwriting. With Property & Casualty, lower catastrophe losses and improved auto underwriting contributed to solid adjusted earnings, which more than doubled year-over-year. For our international segments, Asia benefited from volume growth, higher investment income and lower taxes. Latin America faced only minor currency headwinds and EMEA continued to benefit from expense management. Moving to total company investments, recurring investment income was up 6.7% from a year ago, as the growth and higher interest rates account for the increase. In the quarter, our global new money yield was 3.98% in comparison to an average roll-off rate of 4.52%. Our new money rate was 68 basis points higher than a year ago due to higher interest rates and the significant amount of new money invested in the U.S. after winning the FedEx pension risk transfer deal. Pre-tax variable investment income totaled $176 million in the quarter as private equity and hedge fund returns were down from prior periods. While pre-tax variable investment income is below our quarterly guidance range of $200 million to $250 million, on a year-to-date basis, VII is at the midpoint of guidance. I would like to take a moment to frame our view of the U.S. economy and the current credit environment. U.S. macroeconomic performance has been strong, aided by tax reform, repatriation of corporate profits and regulatory relief. The momentum in corporate earnings, which began in late 2016, has continued into the second quarter. Although U.S. credit valuations have been on the tight end of historical range, spreads have widened more recently on geopolitical and trade concerns. The timing and drivers of a potential economic downturn are currently an area of focus in the credit markets where corporate debt has continued to grow, primarily driven by M&A. We have seen substantial growth in BBB rated corporate debt, as well as aggressive issuance in the syndicated bank loan market. While we do not believe a downturn is imminent, we are keeping a close eye on the evolving credit market. With regard to specific fixed income classes, we remain largely neutral on U.S. investment grade bonds and municipals with dedicated revenue streams. We are more cautious on general obligation bonds of states and municipalities with large unfunded pension obligations, as well as certain parts of the high yield market. We continue to favor private placement credit given our ability to structure deals, negotiate financial covenants, and receive yields above comparable publicly traded bonds. Beyond credit, we favor privately originated assets such as Residential Whole Loans, agricultural loans and commercial mortgages. Over the last decade, the credit markets have become less liquid for a variety of reasons, including post-financial crisis regulation. We are mindful of this, understanding more time may be required to make portfolio changes. As a result, identifying market shifts and executing strategies early, traditional strengths of MetLife have become even more important in the current environment. Turning to expenses. I want to provide an update on the progress we are making toward our commitment to realize $800 million in pre-tax savings by 2020. In the first quarter, we began publishing our expense ratio in a way that will allow you to track our progress against our expense target. We indicated that to meet our goal, MetLife would need to reduce its direct expense ratio excluding PRTs and notable items by approximately 200 basis points versus our 2015 baseline of 14.3%. In dollar terms, this means $1.05 billion of gross savings to get to $800 million net. The $250 million difference is a stranded overhead from the Brighthouse Financial separation. As you can see in our quarterly financial supplement, our direct expense ratio in the second quarter was 13.0%. For the full-year 2018, we think the ratio will be slightly higher as expenses tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year. This was true in 2017 as well. Importantly, we remain highly confident that we will achieve a 200-basis point reduction by 2020. As part of our ongoing process, MetLife has been engaged in an intensive effort to sharpen our focus on efficiency. Our goal is to build a margin safety above our $1.05 billion gross savings target to ensure that we succeed even if certain initiatives fall short. To become more efficient, we are aggressively managing our spending in vendors and consultants, building out our digital, distribution, and service channels and automating processes. We have gone through every expense initiative line by line and provided detailed support for the saves. This rigorous exercise is what gives us confidence that we will reach our goal. Just as important as reducing expenses is growing revenues. While the spinoff of Brighthouse Financial was a tremendous achievement, it should not create an impression that MetLife is more focused on exiting businesses than entering them. I am a strong supporter of growth that exceeds our cost of capital and provides a fair return to our shareholders, such as our Logan Circle Partners acquisition, our $2 billion purchase of Provida in Chile, and our $6 billion FedEx pension risk transfer deal. Our purpose at MetLife is to provide financial protection in people and their families. When we grow responsibly, our customers receive the help they need, our employees enjoy better career opportunities and our shareholders earn better returns. Moving to capital management, we repurchased $1.1 billion of our common shares during the second quarter, completing our $2 billion buyback authorization. Also in the quarter, our board of directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Combined with our common dividend, total capital returned to the shareholders in the quarter came to more than $1.5 billion. We continued buying back shares in third quarter, repurchasing another $236 million of common stock, leaving $870 million remaining on our current $1.5 billion authorization, which we anticipate completing by year end. MetLife's business is predicated on keeping the promises we make to policyholders. We view our commitments to our shareholders no differently. On our last call, I spoke about how our clean first quarter represented a down payment on the improved performance expected of MetLife. We are pleased to make a subsequent payment in the second quarter. In addition to being a less complex company, we have made several significant financial commitments to our shareholders. These include boosting our return on equity to 800 basis points to 900 basis points above the 10-year treasury yield and eventually to 1,000 basis points on a sustainable basis, generating a free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% on average over a two-year period, achieving pre-tax net savings of $800 million by 2020, and returning roughly $5 billion of capital to shareholders in 2018. We are highly focused on meeting or exceeding these commitments. At the year's midpoint, we are well on our way to doing so, which we believe will lead to greater shareholder value over time. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to discuss our quarterly financial results in detail.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I'll begin by discussing the 2Q 2018 supplemental slides that we released last evening along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. These slides cover our second quarter 2018 financial results and business highlights. Starting on page 4. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income was $845 million, which included $159 million mark-to-market loss related to the disposition of our remaining investment in Brighthouse Financial. In addition, costs associated with the debt exchange were $53 million after tax. Excluding these items, net income was $1.1 billion in the quarter or $269 million lower than adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion, primarily due to the results in our investment portfolio and hedging program. Overall, the relatively modest net investment and net derivative losses in the quarter reflect MetLife's post-separation product mix and refined hedging program, as well as the continued benign credit environment. Now, let's turn to page 5. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $42.76 as of June 30, down 1% versus $43.36 as of March 31. The decline was primarily due to a change in FCTA in the second quarter as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against all major currencies. As of June 30, FCTA was a negative $4.7 billion, which reflects a decline of nearly $1 billion or $0.96 per share from March 31. While the change this quarter was significant, it largely reverses the FCTA gain that we had in the first quarter of 2018 when the dollar had weakened. As we have seen in our results, the FCTA senses the movements in currencies and can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We only have one notable item in the quarter as shown on page six and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. Expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $62 million after tax or $0.06 per share. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items were $1.4 billion or $1.36 per share. On page 7, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 18% year-over-year and 17% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 25% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers in the quarter included favorable underwriting, solid volume growth, and lower taxes primarily due to U.S. tax reform. These were partially offset by weaker investment margins due to lower variable investment income. Pre-tax variable investment income was $176 million, down $46 million versus the prior year quarter of $222 million due to lower private equity and hedge fund returns. Despite the weakness this quarter, year-to-date VII results are in line with our expectations and we are maintaining our outlook call range of $200 million to $250 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. With regards to business performance, Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 29% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting margins, volume growth, and the impact of U.S. tax reform. Underwriting results were particularly strong in non-medical health. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for non-medical health was 73.1%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 76.9% and below the low end of its target range of 75% to 80%. Non-medical health's favorable underwriting expense was primarily driven by disability, which had a higher net closure rate and lower incidence than the prior-year quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio was 87.9%, which was within one standard deviation of the prior-year quarter of 87.3% and within its target range of 85% to 90%. Group Benefits continues to see strong momentum in its top line. Adjusted PFOs were up 4% year-over-year with growth across all markets and most product lines. Year-to-date, 2018 sales were down 4% relative to first half of 2017, which had record jumbo case sales. Group Benefits continued its strategy to grow voluntary products, which were up double digit for the first half of 2018 versus the prior-year period. In addition, we are also continuing to grow downmarket as regional and small market sales were above our target year-to-date. Adjusted earnings in Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS were up 32%. The key drivers were favorable interest and underwriting margins, volume growth, and lower taxes due to U.S. tax reform. This is partially offset by lower VII. While the flatter yield curve has put some pressure on RIS adjusted earnings, this was more than offset by higher general account balances from continued growth in nearly all businesses, most notably in pension risk transfer. Growth is highlighted by the $6 billion FedEx deal that we closed in May. In addition, we have been able to maintain investment spreads, which were 129 basis points in 2Q and within our outlook call range of 110 basis points to 135 basis points. Earnings from certain near expiring interest rate caps were a key contributor to spreads in the quarter, offsetting weakness in variable investment income. Excluding VII, RIS spreads were 113 basis points, which is up both year-over-year and sequentially. RIS adjusted PFOs were $6.5 billion, up from $1.2 billion in the prior-year quarter due to the FedEx deal. Excluding FedEx and all other PRT deals in both quarters, adjusted PFOs were up 26% year-over-year, primarily due to strong sales of structured settlements and income annuities. On PRT, we continue to see a good pipeline of all sizes and structures. Our approach will continue to balance growth with an efficient use of capital. Property & Casualty or P&C adjusted earnings more than doubled year-over-year, driven by favorable underwriting margins in both auto and home, as well as lower catastrophes. The auto combined ratio was 91.2%, down 5.3 points versus the second quarter of 2017 due to increased average premiums and expense management. Pre-tax catastrophe losses were $108 million in the quarter, but $19 million lower than the prior-year quarter. This improvement was due to lower cat activity, as well as management actions that we have taken over the last 12 months. In regards to the top line, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 1%, while sales were up 23% versus 2Q 2017. We continue to see strong sales momentum in 2Q 2018, particularly through our Group channel. Asia adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 22% and up 20% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth, investment margin and lower taxes. This is partially offset by higher expenses. Asia adjusted earnings were aided by several one-time items in the quarter of approximately $20 million. Asia sales were up 26% on a constant currency basis and Japan sales were up 42% driven by strong foreign currency denominated annuities as well as accident & health sales. FX in A&H products remain our primary focus in Japan as the shift away from yen life (21:09) products over the past three years is now complete. We believe that we have a competitive advantage selling these products and continue to see solid momentum for the remainder of the year. Other Asia sales were up 3%, primarily driven by China. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 6% and down 3% on a constant currency basis. Higher taxes in the region and the impact from U.S. tax reform offset solid volume growth. On a pre-tax basis, Latin America adjusted earnings were up 6% on a reported basis and up 9% on a constant currency basis. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 5% and up 7% on a constant currency basis due to volume growth across the region. Latin America sales were up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher direct marketing sales throughout the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 19% and up 15% on a constant currency basis due to expense margin improvement, as well as volume growth in Turkey and Western Europe. This was partially offset by the impact of U.S. tax reform. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 8% and up 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth in Western Europe and Turkey. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by the benefit from U.S. tax reform and favorable expense margins. This was mostly offset by less favorable life underwriting and investment margins. In regards to underwriting, life claims were up relative to a very strong 2Q 2017, but the interest adjusted benefit ratio this quarter was at the midpoint of our target range of 50% to 55%. Our LTC results remain consistent with expectations, generating positive earnings and we continue to execute on our rate action plan. Corporate & Other adjusted loss excluding notable items was $157 million compared to an adjusted loss of $114 million in 2Q 2017. Primary driver of the year-over-year variance was the impact from U.S. tax reform. Overall, the company's effective tax rate in the quarter was 15.4% due to a one-time reduction in the tax accrual of $36 million following a transfer of assets from a foreign subsidiary to its U.S. parent. Excluding this item and other one-time tax items in the quarter, the company's effective tax rate was 18.2%, which is within our prior guidance of 18% to 20%. Turning to page eight, this slide shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2017 as well as the first two quarters of 2018. As Steve noted, we need to bring down our direct expense ratio by approximately 200 basis points from the 14.3% in 2015, which was the baseline year to realize $800 million of pre-tax profit margin improvement. As we noted last quarter, we believe the direct expense ratio on an annual basis is the best measure of our unit cost initiative progress as the ratio can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. This ratio captures the relationships of revenues and the expenses over which we have the most control. We believe this best reflects the impact on profit margins. For this quarter, the direct expense ratio was 13%, excluding notable items and pension risk transfers. This is essentially in line with the first quarter of 2018 and below the full-year 2017 ratio of 13.3%. We continue to make good progress despite absorbing over 40 basis points of one-time expenses related to the remediation of our material weaknesses as well as the growth in our investment management business, which has a higher expense ratio. Looking ahead to the back half of the year, we would expect our direct expense ratio to be modestly higher than the first half. This is a function of the strong growth we have enjoyed in our National Accounts business where we will incur enrollment and other costs prior to receiving associated premiums. For the full-year 2018, it's our objective to show improvement in the direct expense ratio compared to 2017. Now, I will provide an update on our progress for remediation of the 4Q 2017 material weaknesses. First, let me discuss the RIS Group annuity reserves. We have now completed the root cause analysis. The findings from that analysis are being addressed by the ongoing remediation activities. This analysis further supports that the current remediation plan continues to be appropriate. Regarding the MetLife Holdings assumed variable annuity guarantee reserves, we have also completed the root cause analysis and incorporated financing to remediation plan. This also confirmed that the current plan continues to be appropriate. We believe the steps we are taking will further strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. While an observation period is required, we continue to work towards clearing the material weaknesses during 2018. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.4 billion at June 30, which is up from $5.1 billion at March 31. The $300 million increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, holding company expenses, preferred stock issuance and liability management. During the quarter, we issued approximately $800 million of preferred stock, bringing our total preferred stock issuance for the year to approximately $1.3 billion. To divest our remaining Brighthouse Financial equity stake, we exchanged BHF stock for MetLife debt, which was a non-cash liability management exercise. The objective of this action is to continue optimize the capital structure in line with the rating agency expectations as well as provide further financial flexibility. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date second quarter statutory earnings were approximately $2.7 billion and net earnings were approximately $2.2 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $792 million from the prior-year period, primarily due to dividends received from a foreign investment subsidiary, which had a corresponding offset in statutory adjusted capital. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.2 billion as of June 30, 2018, down 1% compared to December 31, 2017. Net earnings were more than offset by dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 884% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife had a very strong second quarter in 2018 highlighted by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong and we remain confident that the actions we are taking to implement our strategy will drive free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: And our first question is from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. John, you mentioned that in retirement there was some benefit from interest rate caps that were near expiration. Can you help us quantify that amount as well as think about when those will actually run off?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Hey, Ryan. So, let me just back up. On the outlook call, we indicated that a 10-basis point move would have a $5 million to $10 million impact on earnings. So, since that time, two things have happened. So, first, the three-month LIBOR has risen probably 60 basis points or 70 basis points above our expectations. It's actually up like 90 basis points year-to-date. And so, we did have some out-of-the-money caps that are now in the money. So, that's one. The second thing I would also emphasize is there were certain management actions that we took on the liability side to reduce the exposure to our – to kind of the floating rate liabilities. So, that also had a modest improvement relative to the guidance. So, as a result, I'd say it's temporarily neutralized at this level of rates. I say temporarily because, as you point out, these caps will gradually roll off to the latter half of this year and into 2019. So, ex these actions and the caps, we think the sensitivity holds, but LIBOR has obviously increased outside of our expectations. So, right now through the rest of this year, I would say at these levels we are less sensitive than previously disclosed. And I think what we'll do is we'll try to give you a more holistic update on the next outlook call.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. That's helpful. And then, just one on long-term care. I know that you've said your statutory reserves do not assume any benefit from future premium rate increases. Can you disclose if you assume morbidity improvement currently?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Sure. So, let me just start with a high level – a few high-level comments. So, first, yeah, we will be – we're starting our annual assumption view now. That takes place in the third quarter. So, as we speak, it's underway. And we'll obviously share the results when we get there. I think until then, let me give you some additional color and maybe some guardrails. So, reminders, we have roughly $14.5 billion of statutory reserves. In there, we do not assume any rate increases and we do not assume morbidity improvement. So, that's on the statutory side. For GAAP, we do assume some planned rate increases, but it's really over a short period of time and it's based on our experience to-date. As a reminder, we had roughly 7% rate increase off of 2017. On the premium that we got the rate increase, it was roughly 20% increases on – it was about $250 million of the $750 million of premium we had. So, I think from a GAAP perspective, we would track similar way. We're tracking that way in 2018 to similar levels. Regarding morbidity for GAAP. We do include some assumptions for morbidity improvement. It's on roughly 20% of our long-term care block. So, if we were to eliminate that assumption, we would not incur an LTC charge. It would get absorbed by our loss recognition testing margin and we'd probably still have some left pretty significantly after that. So, hopefully, that gives you a little color.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks, John. That's really helpful.
Operator: Next, we go to line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP: Hi. Thank you. I was just hoping you could comment a bit more on the pension risk transfer pipeline and the competitive environment, particularly for larger deals.
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Erik. This is Michel. So, we continue to find the market opportunity attractive with a good pipeline. Last year was a record year for us from a PRT standpoint. This year, obviously, with the FedEx deal, we'll exceed that. So, we – I think we continue to be active. We continue to see opportunity on the market. Our approach is consistent in terms of balancing growth with the efficient use of capital, also considering alternative uses of capital. So, we'll remain disciplined and consider the risk and pricing parameters for each deal, but we do think that the market opportunity continues to be attractive.
Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP: Got it. And maybe as a followup. Just given Steve's somewhat comment – or cautious comments on credit, do you have any concerns about taking on the asset leverage or just the investment funding needs associated with large PRT blocks?
Steven Jeffrey Goulart - MetLife, Inc.: Hi. It's Steve Goulart. The best answer is no. I mean, I think just go back to Steve's comments. I don't think we're sounding any alarm bells. But we're basically saying, hey, our job's getting tougher in this environment. But remember, we're investing billions of dollars a quarter and we're still finding sound, attractive investment alternatives. It's just that market conditions remain tight. Market structure is different than it was years ago. So, we're spending more time just thinking about what happens in the next downturn and how do we position ourselves when we think it's coming. But we're still finding plenty of attractive investments. We are cautious, as Steve mentioned, on certain sectors. But I think our motto, I quote, one of my favorite investors who says, we're still in an environment of move forward with caution.
Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Good morning. Just a few on long-term care. Just given all the peer charges occurring around you, any reason to do a deeper dive for your 3Q review this year including third-party involvement?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Tom, it's John. I would say, we are normal course. We annually test our assumption rigorously, so we have in the past. We continue to do so and we will in the third quarter. I don't see anything changing in how we do things. So...
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: And my followup is, if you look at Met's development over the last few years compared to others, Met's have looked a lot better. You really have not seen the same level of adverse development that I would say the vast majority of peers are showing right now. Is it – and can you comment at all – I'm sure you guys have looked into this as well. So, can you comment at all about what you think is actually happening that is preventing Met from seeing the same deterioration that has now become pretty broad based?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah. I think I will just go back to maybe the risk profile that we articulated, I mean, over the last few quarters, right? So, I think part of it is when we exited, we exited in 2010. I think we have a – if you think about our block, it's pretty high percentage. Almost 40% of that block is in the Group space, which is generally the lower ages, smaller policies, less generous provisions than the individual. We've been doing a lot on getting premiums in. We've taken rate actions. We started early. I think that's a big component of that. We have $750 million of premium coming in and we'd be getting rate increases and we're halfway through the actuarial justified rate increases. So, I think it's a combination of risk profile coupled with, I'd say, management actions that have occurred.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Next, we go to line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, thanks a lot. So, just kind of looking at slide 8, the direct expense ratio, and you want to get it from 14.3% in 2015, down by 200 basis points into 2020. Last two years, it was 13.3%. Now, it's kind of 13% and you're saying it's going to kind of come up a bit as we go to the second half of the year. So – and it was good that you pointed out the 40 bps of material weakness. So, does that come off next year once you kind of resolve the material weakness? And maybe you could give us a little color on the trajectory of this direct expense ratio over the next two years as it seems to have kind of leveled out over the last three years.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Andrew. So, couple things I would just note to help with the trajectory comment. Don't forget, if you went backwards, we have the strand came in. So, that kind of offset some of the saves that we would have otherwise seen. So, I think the trend will look better if we normalize for the strand. That's one. Two, just to edit one thing you said, the 40 basis points is combination of two things. It's the extra cost we have for remediating the material weaknesses coupled with our growth in the investment management business, which is high-returning business but has a higher expense ratio. So, we are – but that doesn't change our commitment. We're still committed to getting 200 basis points. I think I will go back to Steve's comments to assure you that we feel very comfortable about achieving that by 2020. This is a bigger exercise than just a cost exercise. This is a transformational exercise. We are investing for not – for this just to be completed by 2020, but investing so this is an ongoing platform that we can leverage for growth. And so I think some of it will kind of start to trend in into 2019 and 2020 at a better clip. But a lot of this right now we're doing a lot of the investment now that will translate into the saves in the future.
Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. And then just to follow up on Asia. PFO were kind of – they were up about 1% year-over-year. Do you see that materially going up over time? Or are things a bit slower in Japan where it might be a bit mature?
Steven Jeffrey Goulart - MetLife, Inc.: Well, I think if we go back to our outlook call, Andrew, I think we're still in line with our expectations there and very comfortable with that. Japan actually continue to be very strong. We talked about that. And we're also seeing strong growth in other markets. Remember, it's a portfolio of 10 different countries. They're not all going to perform the exact same at any point in time. But basically, that strong sales growth in certain other markets slower growth given some of the environment, including some regulatory changes in different markets. But all in all, I think we're still expecting – what we've seen is building momentum in the second quarter and we're very comfortable with what we've said for outlook call expectations.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: I would just add, Andrew, just also if you think to the mix of business there a little bit. So, we're shifting quite a bit to the foreign currency denominated to FAS 97-type product. So, it's fee oriented as opposed to premium. So, we're seeing great growth there I think as Steve talked about. But you may not see it just in the premium line, but we're seeing it through margin.
Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. So, for guidance, low-single-digit PFO growth makes sense. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And next, we will go to line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy S. Bhullar - JPMorgan: Hi. Good morning. First just on – I thought overall your international results were pretty good, but there were a few areas of weakness just specifically sales in ex-Japan Asia, Mexico sales, and then EMEA sales overall seemed weak as well. So, could you just give us some color on what drove that and what your outlook is?
Steven Jeffrey Goulart - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Jimmy, it's Steve Goulart again. Just sort of picking upon what I just commented on really, again, there were markets outside Japan where we did see slower sales growth. But when I think about why that happened, I mentioned we saw regulatory changes in certain markets. We've been really sort of rebounding from those changes and I do see building momentum. So, I think we're comfortable with the full-year outlook in really all of Asia and ex-Japan as well.
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: And for EMEA, this is Michel, Jimmy. A couple of comments. One is keep in mind that our sales figure is influenced by the exit from the UK Wealth Management business last year. If you adjust for that, our sales are up 1%. That's still below the level that we'd expect for EMEA. The main driver for that is the increasingly competitive pricing environment in the Gulf on the Group Medical business in particular. The margins are (42:12) on this business and we're holding firm on pricing and that's having an impact on our sales.
Jimmy S. Bhullar - JPMorgan: Okay. And then, Mexico, I guess, there was the sale there as well, so...
Oscar Schmidt - MetLife, Inc.: Hey, Jimmy, this is Oscar. Good morning. So, let me talk about sales first. So, sales year-over-year grew 6%, but if you adjust for the divestiture of our Afore business in Mexico, that's like three percentage points, goes to nine percentage points. So, well aligned with our high-single-digit expectation from outlook call. If you go to premiums and fees, which is at 7% year-over-year, you do the same, if you adjust for the Afore divestiture, it goes to 8%, which is again aligned with our high-single-digit expectation.
Jimmy S. Bhullar - JPMorgan: Okay. And then if I could ask another question on long-term care. You were pretty active at buybacks this quarter. Your review's coming up. How concerned are you or what's the likelihood of it being stat charge as well if you take the charge? And do you think under reasonable scenarios it could have an impact on your free cash flow or capital deployment strategy for this year and next?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, Jimmy in terms of stat reserves, we are comfortable at the present time. We're going through the assumption review as I said in the third quarter. But right now, there's no reason to believe or there's any concerns for changing our capital management plans.
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: As I said in my remarks, we anticipate extinguishing the $1.5 billion authorization for share repurchases by the end of the year, so that's on track.
Jimmy S. Bhullar - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have a question from John Nadel with UBS. Please go ahead.
John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, good morning. So, this may be a little bit complicated to do on a consolidated basis, but it looks like investment income was up pretty significantly versus the level we've seen maybe the average of the last five quarters, 4% or maybe a little over 4% higher. And that really doesn't look like there was much of a corresponding offset anywhere in the interest credit line or otherwise. And I guess it's really evident in RIS, maybe a little bit in international, especially Asia. Just trying to understand the sustainability of this higher level of investment income. Are we already seeing the benefits of higher new money rates? And is this something – is this the new level we ought to think about from here?
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: John, it's Steve. Again, let me – I'll start with just sort of investment performance and then let John talk more about it from a margin perspective. But put in the context of what's happening in the environment. Rates have, I guess, you could say steadily if you use the point-in-time. But rates continue to rise in general over time. We continue to see our new money yield rising along with it. I don't get hung up on quarter-to-quarter. We're really looking at trends. But we do see the overall performance and yield in the portfolio rising. Is it sustainable? I think it depends a lot on the overall market, what happens with underlying rate levels and, of course, what happens with spreads. And then, I think I'll let John comment more about overall investment margin.
John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC: But, Steve, if I can...
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah.
John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC: ...just follow up real quick. Was the new money rate – I know it's a global sort of approach, but was the global new money rate in the last couple of quarters above the portfolio yield?
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: No. No, we haven't had our new money rate above the portfolio yield in years.
John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC: Okay.
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: But we're getting closer.
John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC: Okay.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, I would just add, John, that I think it's probably always relative to expectations here, right? I mean – so, we did. We are starting – seeing a benefit from the rate environment and we've seen some benefits for some of the things I talked about earlier in RIS. We saw some initiatives in Asia that have helped us. So, I think it depends a little bit where you're referencing, but those are probably the two largest businesses seeing the benefit of some investment margin.
John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just real quick. I think you had mentioned one-time impact on the tax rate and I forget what the other one was. I think there was something in Asia. Could you just remind us of those real quick?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah. It's for taxes you're referencing?
John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. I think you mentioned something on the tax rate. The underlying tax rate was a little over 18%.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yes. So, it's 15.4%, but there's a one-time charge – or, sorry, benefit coming through in Corporate & Other relates to this one-time transfer that we had of some assets from a foreign subsidiary to U.S. parent really our effort to simplify some structure and it's just a release of an accrual that we had up in GAAP.
John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And in Asia, I think you mentioned 20 year a little over $20 million?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Those are – what we said there was really just some one-time items. It wasn't tax related. Half of it is – actually, it just – that region got allocated a higher level of VII this quarter. The other half, I would kind of put into campus and reserve refinements.
John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC: Got you. Okay, thanks.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just the first one on long-term care. Could you provide any clarity just on the mortality improvement that's assumed on statutory and GAAP?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, I don't think we're going to go through that right now. Just I think we're going to – obviously, we're going through our annual assumption review and that's not something we would disclose at this time.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then maybe just a followup. Just thinking about Holdings more broadly. It seems like the supply of reinsurance capital is pretty robust. Any updated thoughts on the potential for doing a risk reduction transaction or risk transfer transaction whether it be long-term care, annuity blocks, et cetera?
Martin J. Lippert - MetLife, Inc.: Alex, this Marty Lippert. We continue to look for economic deals that can help drive positive returns. And when we come across one that looks strong enough to us, we'll pursue it.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And would you guys expect a cash flow coming out of MetLife Holdings to remain the same, I guess, as you've kind of stated previously? Can you just remind us about what that cash flow would be relative to earnings and what you expect there?
Martin J. Lippert - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah. I would just say it's consistent with the guidance we've given. We see this – there's a little bit of a unique situation going in 2018 because of the change in taxes. But going forward, it's about a 5% runoff.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And would cash flow be greater than 100% potentially?
Martin J. Lippert - MetLife, Inc.: I don't know about greater. I'd say around 100%.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Good morning, and thank you. Two questions on the Property Casualty (sic) [Property & Casualty] (50:13) segment. If you could just discuss pricing trends in personal auto. And then I think you referenced some management actions you've taken to lower catastrophes this year. If you could just give us a little bit of color on that and if possible how much it might have reduced your catastrophe load 2018 versus 2017?
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Larry. This is Michel. So, on auto, I think we've seen loss trends that are more favorable generally speaking in recent quarters especially compared to 2015 and 2016. We think this is due to a number of factors, mainly the miles driven, which seemed to have flattened after several years of increase. I think this is reflected in the industry. If you look at rate taking, I think it slowed down. We had taken aggressive action from late 2016 onwards above industry level rate action. I think that's reflected in some of the improvement that you see in our auto loss ratios. We think that going forward our rate action would be more in line with industry. And on the cat front, again we had taken a number of management actions mostly focused on reducing and lessening our exposure to areas where historically we had seen significant cat activity. And I think we see the benefit of that. If we compare our second quarter cats for this year compared to last year on a pre-tax basis, they were better by $19 million. So, I think that's reflective of some of the action that we've taken.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Is there a specific geography in terms of the actions on the cat side?
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: There are certain geographies where we were experiencing a high level of cat losses. Dallas-Fort Worth, for example, Colorado. So, we've taken action to – but not limited to those states, but we've certainly taken action to lessen exposure in those areas.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Great, thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: My question was answered. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we go to line of John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Thank you. I know you guys have been focused on growing your investment management, asset management business. Could you talk about what percent, if any, of your assets under management are exposed to index funds?
Steven Jeffrey Goulart - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah. We do have a fairly large block of index funds, but they're all related to MetLife separate accounts. It is less than a quarter of our overall third-party assets if you want to include it in that and it's really not material from a revenue generation perspective.
John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Thank you. And then you talked about wanting to grow, not divest. What areas are you looking to grow through M&A other than asset management obviously? Thank you.
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Hey, it's Steve Kandarian. We look at opportunities in the marketplace that fit our strategy. And obviously, the areas we are in now in the United States are largely the Group area and the Retirement area. And of course, outside of the United States, we have a significant position in Latin America, Asia and Middle East. So, those been the logical places for us to be looking for opportunities. But as we've always said, we compare any acquisition opportunity against the share repurchase and doesn't mean we wouldn't do an acquisition or that has to be accretive day one, but it has to be accretive quickly for us to pursue something.
John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Thanks for the answer.
Operator: There are no other questions. You may continue.
John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.: Okay. Great. If there's no other questions, thanks, everybody, for your attention and we'll speak with you next quarter.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife first quarter 2018 earnings release conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to the trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the risk factor section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, head of Investor Relations. [05LC2Y-E John Hall] Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's first quarter 2018 earnings call. On this call we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and on our quarterly financial supplement. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night we released an expanded set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. After prepared remarks, we will have a q-and-a session that, given the busy earnings call schedule this morning, will extend no longer than the top of the hour. So in fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As you know, we announced on Tuesday that John Hele is retiring from MetLife and has been succeeded as CFO by John McCallion. I want to thank John Hele for his service and for being a strategic partner on MetLife's refreshed enterprise strategy which has made us a simpler company and strengthened our free cash flow generation. I also want to welcome John McCallion to the CFO role. I have worked closely with John for over 10 years and I have every confidence that he will bring the skill, energy, and leadership needed to help MetLife create significant value for our shareholders. Moving to financial results, last night we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.36, up from $1.20 per share a year ago. Tax reform added roughly $0.10 per share to adjusted earnings year-over-year. Overall, it was a very strong quarter with particularly good underwriting. Variable investment income came in above expectations and foreign currency also provided some lift. Despite rising in the quarter, current interest rate levels continued to pressure recurring investment yields. Equity markets had limited impact on consolidated adjusted results. Adjusted return on equity in the quarter was 12.8%, the highest adjusted ROE for MetLife since the third quarter of 2014. After notable items, adjusted earnings were $1.34 per share, the net difference of $0.02 per share included a positive $0.06 per share from the final portion of a Japanese variable annuity reserve release that we elected to recognize in the first quarter. This was partially offset by costs to achieve our target of $800 million in pre-tax annual run-rate savings by 2020. Net income for the quarter was $1.2 billion compared to $867 million a year ago. We've been working to reduce the sensitivity of net income to capital markets and narrow the gap between net income and adjusted earnings. In a volatile first quarter for the capital markets, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion, only moderately above net income. This points to the progress we are making to lower our sensitivity to the capital markets following the spin of Brighthouse and the repositioning of some of our hedge programs. Moving to business highlights, within the U.S. business segment, Group Benefits reported another quarter of strong underwriting results notwithstanding seasonally high flu claims. Volume growth and underwriting contributed to strong adjusted earnings within Retirement and Income Solutions. We are working hard and making meaningful progress on our group annuity remediation plan. John McCallion will provide more details in his prepared remarks. Driven by good auto insurance results, Property & Casualty adjusted earnings were strong despite industry-wide catastrophe activity in the quarter. For Asia, our largest international segment, adjusted earnings benefited from volume growth due to higher premiums, fees, and other revenues and higher assets. In Latin America, a one-time tax adjustment in Chile and lower encaje (06:54) contribution held adjusted earnings below our expectations. EMEA adjusted earnings reflected sustained expense management efforts in volume growth in Europe and Turkey. Finally, MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings benefited from tax reform and good underwriting, offset in part by lower recurring interest margins. Turning to investments, recurring investment income was up 1.3 % from a year ago, aided by asset growth which outweighed the drag from low interest rates. In the quarter our global new money yield stood at 3.37%, compared to an average roll-off rate of 4.38%. Pre-tax variable investment income totaled $268 million in the quarter, which is above our quarterly guidance range of $200 million to $250 million. Private equity returns continued to be the largest contributor to performance, particularly leveraged buyout and venture capital funds. Moving on to capital management, we repurchased $1 billion of our common stock during the first quarter. Combined with our common dividend, this brought our total capital return in the quarter to $1.5 billion. We continued buying back shares in the second quarter, repurchasing another $350 million of common stock. We have $370 million remaining on our current $2 billion authorization. As a reminder, last week, we also announced a 5% increase in our annual common dividend to $1.68 per share. We expect to divest our remaining stake in Brighthouse Financial before the end of 2018. Since we announced our intention to execute an equity exchange offer late last year, capital market conditions have changed and volatility is up. In addition to an equity exchange offer, we are now exploring other transactions that may provide better economics, including a direct sale of our Brighthouse Financial shares or an exchange offer for MetLife debt securities. The timeframe and the primary objective – divest our Brighthouse shares and buy back MetLife shares – remain the same, regardless of the form of the transaction. Turning to the external environment, our business continues to benefit from a number of tailwinds. Tax reform remains broadly favorable for MetLife, both in terms of its direct earnings impact and the boost it provides to jobs and growth. As is always the case, the benefits of lower taxes will be shared among our key constituencies. As we announced in February, MetLife will invest a portion of the proceeds to strengthen the financial security of its employees. We also expect that, over time, a portion of the tax savings will be competed away, resulting in more affordable financial protection for consumers. Finally, we expect a meaningful portion of the tax savings will be returned to shareholders. Those shareholders, in turn, will reallocate capital to other productive investments or will drive economic growth through increased consumer spending. Another tailwind for MetLife is the overall strength of the economy. The U.S. unemployment rate has held constant at 4.1% for six months and a record 148 million Americans are now employed. There's additional upside if robust economic growth results in a higher labor force participation rate. A strong U.S. labor market is always positive for our market-leading U.S. Group Benefits business. We are also seeing positive trends with regard to interest rates. From the 2017 low of 2.06%, the 10-year Treasury rate has risen approximately 90 basis points and is now at its highest level in over three years. While geopolitical uncertainty and the prospect of a trade war could (11:33) that drives down interest rates, we believe the economic fundamentals point toward rising rates, although not to pre financial crisis levels. With U.S. budget deficits rising and the Federal Reserve unwinding its balance sheet, we see the supply of Treasuries outstripping demand which, all else being equal, should push prices down and yields up. I would like to close this morning with some comments on MetLife's commitment to building a culture of operational excellence, which is one of the four cornerstones of our refreshed enterprise strategy. After some negative surprises, we are pleased that MetLife delivered a clean quarter that exceeded consensus. However, we also recognize that this is merely a down payment on the improved performance investors expect at MetLife. While issues can always arise in a company the size of MetLife, we have significantly strengthened our focus on execution. We are escalating issues sooner and insisting on a greater degree of management rigor. A case in point is our unit cost improvement program, or UCI. As you know, our target is $1.05 billion in pre-tax run rate savings by 2020. Net of $250 million in stranded overhead from the separation of Brighthouse Financial, that translates into $800 million to the bottom line. This quarter, for the first time, we are publishing our expense ratio in a way that will allow you to track our progress on UCI. We have already achieved more than $400 million of gross savings toward our target and while our progress will not always be linear, we are fully committed to delivering on this commitment. As I noted in my annual letter to shareholders, we've overcome our most significant regulatory challenge with the victory in our SIFI litigation. We have overcome our major macroeconomic challenge with a refreshed strategy that makes us a less market-sensitive company. And we will also overcome our operational challenges by resolving our material weaknesses, achieving the cost savings we have promised and delivering more predictable earnings and strong free cash flow. With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our quarterly financial results in detail.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Let me start by acknowledging what a great honor it is to be named MetLife's Chief Financial Officer. I look forward to working with all of you in the future. Now let's get to the highlights in the quarter. I will begin by discussing the 1Q18 Supplemental Slides that we released last evening, along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. These slides address several key areas of focus for investors: first quarter 2018 financial results and business highlights; the impact from U.S. tax reform; our unit cost initiative or UCI; and an update on our remediation plans. Starting on page 4, this schedule provides a reconciliation of net income and adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income was $1.2 billion and roughly $200 million lower than adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion due to the results in our investment portfolio and hedging program. Net investment losses were $263 million, which included a loss of $168 million related to mark-to-market impact on our holdings in Brighthouse Financial. Net derivative gains were $276 million after tax, primarily driven by changes in foreign currencies. Overall, the relatively modest net income volatility in the quarter reflects MetLife's post-separation product mix and refined hedging program. Book value per share excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $43.36 as of March 31, up 1% versus the sequential quarter and up 3% after adjusting for the adoption of certain new accounting rules in the quarter related to tax reform. Year-over-year book value per share is down 15% but up 8% after adjusting for the spinoff of Brighthouse Financial and related financial impacts. This growth was driven by strong earnings over the prior four quarters. Our two notable items on the quarter are shown on page 5 and highlighted in our news release and quarterly financial supplement. First, we had a release of reinsurance reserves related to variable annuity guarantees assumed from a former operating joint venture in Japan. Our assumed Japan JV (sic) [VA] reserves are accounted for under two methods. The error leading to the material weakness that was discovered and corrected in the 2017 10-K was on a larger portion of the reserve, which utilizes the derivative accounting model. There is a smaller part of the assumed reserve accounted for under the insurance model, which also required an adjustment. Given the size of this adjustment, we elected to process a cumulative catch-up for this part of the assumed reserve in the first quarter. This reserve refinement benefited adjusted earnings in MetLife Holdings by $52 million after tax, or $0.06 per share. Second, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $34 million after tax or $0.03 per share. In total, notable items in the quarter increased adjusted earnings by $28 million. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items were $1.4 billion or $1.34 per share. On page 6, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 6% year-over-year and up 3% on a constant currency basis. On a per-share basis, adjusted earnings were up 12% and up 9% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Positive year-over-year drivers in the quarter included favorable underwriting, solid volume growth, and lower taxes due to tax reform which I will discuss in more detail shortly. These were partially offset by weaker investment margins and a flatter yield curve. However, we are encouraged by the recent rise in interest rates and would expect our average new money rate and roll-off rate to converge when we have a sustained 10- year U.S. Treasury in the range of 3% to 3.25%. Pre-tax variable investment income was $268 million, essentially flat to the prior-year quarter. VII continues to benefit from strong private equity returns. In regards to business performance, Group Benefits adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 14% quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by the impact of U.S. tax reform. Excluding the impact of tax reform and notable items, adjusted earnings were down 6%. Group Benefits had solid volume growth and favorable underwriting, most notably in non-medical health. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for non-medical health was 75.9%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 79.9% and at the low end of its targeted range of 75% to 80%. Non-medical health underwriting experience was strong across all product lines. It should be noted that some of the improvement in non-medical health loss ratio is driven by the reinstatement of the health insurer tax in the Affordable Care Act. Although neutral to earnings, this increases our expense ratio and reduces our loss ratio. The group life mortality ratio was 88%, which was within its targeted range of 85% to 90% but higher than the prior year quarter of 86.9%, primarily due to elevated flu-related deaths. In addition, Group Benefits adjusted earnings were dampened by lower investment margin and higher expenses, primarily due to technology investments supporting our growth initiatives. Group Benefits had another strong sales quarter. Year-over-year sales were down 1% versus first quarter 2017 which included record jumbo case sales. Group Benefits saw continued momentum in its strategy to grow downmarket and involuntary products. Regional and small market sales were above our expectations year-over-year and voluntary sales were up double digits versus the prior year quarter. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items and retirement income solutions or RIS, were up 32% and up 8% when also adjusting for the impact from tax reform. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and volume growth. This was partially offset by weaker interest margins from lower VII for this segment and the impact of continued spread of compression. RIS adjusted PFOs were $371 million, down 23% from the prior-year period, driven by lower pension risk transfer and structured settlement sales. On PRT, as we have noted in prior calls, sales can be lumpy. And the first quarter tends to be the slowest for transactions. We continue to see a good PRT pipeline of all sizes and structures. Our approach will continue to balance growth with an efficient use of capital. Property and casualty or P&C had a strong quarter as adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 33% year-over-year driven by favorable auto underwriting and lower catastrophes. The auto combined ratio was 91.3%, down 6.5 points versus 1Q 2017, due to increased average premiums and lower costs. Auto results have benefited from targeted rate increases and management actions to create value. Pre-tax catastrophe losses were $58 million in the quarter but $54 million lower than the prior-year quarter. In regards to the top line, P&C PFOs were up 1% while sales were up 16% versus 1Q 2017. Asia adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 10% and up 6% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth and lower taxes, partially offset by higher one-time expenses. Asia sales were down 10% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were up 9%, driven by strong FX annuity sales. This was partially offset by lower life and A&H sales relative to strong sales in 1Q 2017. Other Asia sales were down 31% compared to very strong sales in the prior year quarter which included a large group case in Australia. Latin America adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were down 3% and down 11% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were higher taxes due to U.S. tax reform and a one-time tax item in Chile as well as a lower encaje (24:05) return versus a year ago. Higher taxes in the quarter masked good underlying business fundamentals for Latin America, highlighted by volume growth and lower claims. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 8% and up 2% on a constant currency basis. Latin America sales were down 4% on a constant currency basis as growth across the region was more than offset by lower Mexico group sales. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 8% and down 5% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to impacts from U.S. tax reform, Excluding tax reform, adjusted earnings were up 19% and up 4% on a constant currency basis driven by volume growth and lower expenses. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 11% and up 2% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth in Europe and Turkey. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of U.S. tax reform and favorable underwriting results in life, annuities, and long-term care. If tax reform would have passed prior to our December outlook call, we would have guided to adjusted earnings of up 7% in 2018, rather than down 10%. And given favorable underwriting results in the first quarter, we now expect adjusted earnings to be up approximately 10% in 2018. Corporate and other adjusted loss excluding notable items was $169 million compared to an adjusted loss of $30 million in 1Q 2017. The primary driver of the year-over-year variance was the impact of U.S. tax reform. With regards to U.S. tax reform, page 7 provides a table showing the 1Q 2018 adjusted earnings impact from U.S. tax reform by segment. The column on the far right reflects the 1Q 2018 tax rate for each of the segments. While these tax rates can be simply calculated from the business segment income statements in the QFS, we felt it would be a helpful aid as you think about modeling after-tax earnings in 2018. As shown, the 1Q 2018 benefit to adjusted earnings from U.S. tax reform was $101 million in total. The vast majority of the benefit, as you would expect, is in the U.S. and MetLife Holdings segments. Property & Casualty did not receive much benefit as the business was already at a very low tax rate which did not change. For our international regions, the results vary. Asia, Latin America, and EMEA all receive a smaller tax benefit related to the allocation of corporate overhead expenses. Previously, this benefit was calculated on a 35% tax rate and now 21% due to tax reform. This is the reason that Latin America and EMEA show a negative U.S. tax reform related impact to 1Q 2018 adjusted earnings of $10 million and $7 million respectively. For Asia there is an offsetting benefit from tax reform as Japan's earnings are no longer taxed or topped off at a higher U.S. tax rate, previously 35%. In corporate and other, the negative $67 million impact is primarily due to the results now being taxed at 21%, and therefore receiving a lesser benefit. In regards to modeling for 2018, the 1Q 2018 tax rates as shown in the table are a good run rate for each of the segments with the exception of Latin America. As previously noted, Latin America had a one-time tax item in Chile which resulted in an unusually high tax rate of 35% in 1Q 2018. Adjusting for that item, we would expect Latin America's tax rate to be in the mid to high 20s for the remainder of 2018. Finally, we are reaffirming our prior guidance for the company's effective tax rate of 18% to 20% in 2018. Let me turn to page 8. As Steve mentioned, our unit cost initiative is a critical element of the transformation underway at MetLife. Our goal is to reduce expenses by $800 million pre-tax net of stranded overhead by 2020. This slide shows the adjusted expense ratio and our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2017, as well as 1Q 2018. Adjusted expenses include direct expenses as well as pension, premium taxes, and commissions net of capitalized DAC among other costs. Direct expenses include the cost of labor and other general and administrative costs. You can see from the slide that we have made progress on an annual basis through 2017 in reducing our adjusted expense ratio, which has fallen 250 basis points since the baseline year of 2015, while the direct expense ratio has fallen 100 basis points over the same timeframe. We are measuring expense improvement on an annual basis, since the expense ratio can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We believe the direct expense ratio on an annual basis is the best measure of our UCI progress, since it reflects expenses over which we have the most control and best reflects the impact on profit margins. Turning to page 9, this is a summary of the new expense disclosure now included on page 7 in our quarterly financial supplement. In calculating our expense ratios, we seek consistency by adjusting for two items. First, we back out revenue associated with pension risk transfer deposits since PRT revenues can be lumpy and have few associated direct costs. We believe they can distort the expense ratio and make it look better than it actually is. Second, we adjust for notable items related to other expenses. In addition to the expense ratios, you will be able to see how the ratios are calculated, as well as the split among the various cost components, including employee-related costs. While the adjusted expense ratio and direct expense ratio increased in comparison to the first quarter of 2017, which had unusually low general and administrative expenses, they both showed sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. To the point I made earlier, while the expense ratios for each quarter during 2017 varied, we see improvement on an annual basis. Going forward, we aim to be transparent and accountable as we execute toward achieving our expense target. Now I will provide an update on our progress for remediation of the 4Q 2017 material weaknesses as shown on page 10. We are executing on our plan to remediate the material weaknesses and have developed steering committees, project teams, and working groups to lead the remediation efforts. First, as it relates to the RIS group annuity issue, we have taken the following three actions. One, implemented immediate changes to improve administrative and accounting procedures and search practices to identify, contact, and record responses from unresponsive and missing plan annuitants and to otherwise locate missing annuitants. Two, instituted additional procedures to help address the timely communication and escalation of issues throughout the company. And, three, engaged third-party advisors who have commenced procedures associated with the comprehensive examination and analysis of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the material weakness, under the supervision of MetLife's Chief Risk Officer, Ramy Tadros. Next as it relates to the MetLife Holdings assumed variable annuity guaranteed reserves, we have taken the following two actions. One, implemented immediate changes to the data flows and input controls into the valuation process. These changes included enhanced reconciliation and analytics. Two, we engaged third-party advisors who have commenced procedures associated with the comprehensive examination and analysis of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the material weakness under the supervision of the general auditor. We believe these remediation steps will further strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. We will test the ongoing operating effectiveness of all new controls subsequent to implementation and will consider the material weaknesses remediated after the applicable controls operate effectively for a sufficient period of time. The company will continue to evaluate, update, and improve its internal control over financial reporting as we execute on our remediation plans. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding company were approximately $5.1 billion at March 31, which is down from $5.7 billion at December 31. The $600 million decrease in cash in the quarter reflect the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, and holding company expenses. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Our combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding ALICO, was 423% on an NAIC basis at year-end 2017. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2018 statutory operating earnings were approximately $600 million. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $17.8 billion as of March 31, down 4% from December 31. Net earnings were more than offset by subsidiary dividends paid to the holding company of $1 billion. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 892% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife had a strong first quarter in 2018, highlighted by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. In addition, our cash and capital positions remain strong and we remain confident that the actions we are taking to implement our strategy will drive free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning, I had a couple of questions. First on the Brighthouse disposition, obviously you're exploring an exchange offer. Initially you mentioned a couple other options. Where are you in the process of evaluating those? And based on where you stand, is it possible that you could do something in the first half or is it more likely going to be the second half of the year?
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Jimmy, it's Steve. We're looking at different options. As we said in the prepared remarks, we're just trying to find the best transaction form to derive the greatest benefit for the company overall. Increased volatility in the marketplace impacts, in an exchange offer, equity for equity, the discount you have to give to get enough people to come forward to transact with you to make it a successful exchange offer. So, that's a factor now because the change in volatility from the time we first thought about the form of transaction. But nothing has changed regarding our intent, which is to transact this year. And I think we said before kind of the May-June timeframe is as early as we can start, because of filing requirements that have to come into place, driven out of Brighthouse. So the timeframe hasn't changed and the intent in terms of retiring MetLife shares and disposing of Brighthouse shares has not changed.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then, any color on your long-term care block? Just if you could frame the size, annual premiums, your GAAP and stat reserves, and specifically, on your assumptions, what are your interest rate assumptions over the next few years relative to where rates are right now?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Jimmy, it's John. Yeah, I would just refer you back. I think the statistics we gave back in the fourth quarter hold today. We have roughly $2.5 billion more stat reserves than we do GAAP. So, it's $14.3 billion in stat and $11.7 billion in GAAP. I think we've talked about the rate actions that we've taken. I'd just reference back to the rate actions. We've been fairly successful getting approval over the course of the years. We referenced 7% over the $750 million of premium we get annually. So, all those things were a factor into the good results. I don't know if, Marty, you want to add any color.
Martin J. Lippert - MetLife, Inc.: I guess I would just add that from both the underwriting results as well as expense control that we're seeing there, as well as the rate actions, all of those are moving in a very positive direction. As John mentioned in his opening comments, that's resulting in us feeling much more comfortable about 2018. And relative to the guidance that we gave at the outlook call last year is what's contributed to us moving that guidance up. So all in all, I think, across MetLife Holdings and specifically with respect to long-term care, we're seeing very positive results.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just following up, do you have an assumption of a steep increase in rates over the next several years in your reserving?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, for stat, we only include what's been approved.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: No, no, I meant interest rates.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: So, yeah, we assume a forward rate increase in ultimately getting to our long-term rate of 4.5% – in testing. In the reserves, there's no increase. So, for loss recognition testing, cash flow testing, we would assume that, but for reserving, there's no increase.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi, thanks, good morning. First question on share repurchase, you're clearly on a pace to finish the $2 billion pretty quickly this year. Is that more of a timing issue or should we consider a potential increase to your share repurchase plans relative to the initial guidance?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, it's John, Ryan. I think that's more timing. There's no change to our capital management plans for 2018.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Got it. And then I just wanted to clarify one thing on the unit cost initiative plan. The $800 million net cost save guidance, just to be sure, that is already net of all the TSA payments from Brighthouse that would be running off, that's netted out of that number already?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, that's all-in, right? We said it's a $1.050 billion on a gross basis and then net of strand gets us down to the $800 million.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Got it, okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks. If I could just go back to Steve's comments about the alternatives to the exchange offer. I think he mentioned a debt exchange. So would that be going to MET bondholders and offering to give them Brighthouse common stock in exchange for their debt holdings?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Sean, it's John. Look, I think what Steve talked about is there are alternatives, right? And a debt for equity would be one. I think right now we wouldn't want to get into too much details. We want to maintain flexibility here. And there's a number of other reasons why we can't get into how we might do it. But as Steve said, there's a few options for us to pursue and we'll pursue the most economically beneficial one of those.
Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, thanks. And then I guess, John, a question for you, I don't want to beat a dead horse, but you're new in the role and I think investors were concerned that maybe MET would be backing off the net $800 million expense save target from UCI. So just to be clear, that policy is still in place and that's still the goal and you still think that's attainable.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: I would reiterate what Steve said. We are fully committed to our commitment.
Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC: Good morning. John, just can you make a few comments about the remediation in the accounting controls issue? I heard your prepared remarks, but just like, I guess cutting to the chase, can you provide a little more clarity around when, timing and process that's left here and when you believe you'll be at the end of this.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Tom, it's John. Look, I think we are, as we've said before, there's a lot of work to do. First thing is to identify the root cause. Then we need to implement the full set of procedures. We've done some things, as I articulated in my prepared remarks. But we need to implement the full set of controls and then we need to observe those for a sufficient period of time and usually that's at least two quarters. So but our target for clearing the material weaknesses is still 2018.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC: Got you. And then just back on long-term care. So you have a lot of margin between GAAP and stat. You had favorable results this year. I think from looking at the long-term care exhibits that came out for 2017 your results seem to be fairly well behaved certainly on a relative basis. Taking all that together, should we feel pretty confident heading into balance sheet review season that long-term care from your starting point now looks like it's fine? Or any color you can give there as we think about balance sheet review season and if that's an area to watch?
Martin J. Lippert - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, so it's Marty Lippert. We still are very comfortable with our reserve adequacy and our experience continues to emerge consistent with our reserving assumptions. We test our GAAP and stat reserves annually and are comfortable with the reserve margins that are indicated in those tests. So, yeah, we continue to feel good about it.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, good morning. First question, could you give a little more color about the kind of sudden departure of John Hele and what the thinking was behind it because it just seemed very sudden.
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Andrew, it's Steve. Look, we're – any company decides, at MetLife there's always some change in management from time to time. One of the questions that came up to us after this announcement was why the timing and so on and so forth, but once a decision on John Hele's retirement was made, we decided it was important for the incoming CFO, John McCallion, to oversee the filing of our financial statements for this quarter, and to present on this earnings call to all of you. So you may or may not know but under SEC rules, once a decision is made at this level of an executive, you have to file with the SEC a disclosure within four days. So it's not like there's a great deal of flexibility about timing of announcements. So that's drives a lot of it.
Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So in the quarter, like, there were a lot of positive strides. I shouldn't be concerned then because of this event something might be an issue with the financials?
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: No. So there were two separate tracks, think of it that way. One was John's retirement and the other was we had a quarter coming up to announce. And look, in any big company, there's never a great or perfect time for an announcement of a major change at senior executive levels. I can say a whole bunch of other things besides just the quarter that come up over the course of the year in terms of important points in time in terms of when a Chief Financial Officer would be presenting. So there's never a perfect time. And these two separate tracks were going on. And once the retirement decision was made, then we have to announce.
Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And then just a detail question on the Group Benefits business. The underwriting ratios were quite strong, right in line with your guidance, but you had an other expense line. I think John talked about spending on technology and so forth. The other expense line was up, I think, north of 10% in the quarter. Could you give a sense of whether that line item is sort of a run rate from the first quarter or maybe that comes down a bit?
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, hi, Andrew, this is Michel. So three factors influencing the increase in the expense item. One is the reinstatement of the health insurance tax. So that drives the expense ratio up, it benefits our loss ratio in non-medical health. And the other two factors were – one was the timing of some technology investments that we're making. We had announced in the second half of last year a major initiative in partnership with IBM, additional platform that would help drive our growth in the small market segment, which we feel is an attractive segment for us. So we're seeing some of that investment flow through. And then, as we continue to emphasize voluntary business and we continue to grow that component in terms of our overall sales, that's also having an impact on our acquisition cost. But, as a reminder, again, voluntary is a very attractive segment and it's very consistent with our strategy to grow in that area.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass - Autonomous Research: Hi, thank you. Was hoping you could provide some more color on the underwriting results in RIS in MetLife Holdings this quarter and how they would compare to your normal expectations?
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: Let me start with RIS, Erik. So, we had favorable underwriting in particular in our U.S. pensions business. I would also point out that in the first quarter of 2017, we had also some reserve adjustments which impacted our underwriting in that quarter so that's what you're seeing here. Obviously underwriting can vary quarter to quarter.
Martin J. Lippert - MetLife, Inc.: It's Marty Lippert. In MetLife Holdings business we actually had a very good quarter with respect to underwriting across the board. We would expect that to move back into our normal range that we've communicated to you in the past of between 50% and 55% for the quarter that was in the 47.5% range.
Erik Bass - Autonomous Research: Thank you. And then on the pension risk transfer outlook, you commented that the pipeline for the business is looking good given move in rates and I guess other favorable macro dynamics. Just wondering if you're seeing any implications on your competitive position in that market as a result of the recent issues?
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: No, just to re-emphasize what John mentioned, we think the opportunity in the market will be attractive in terms of flows this year. We've had constructive engagements with the key intermediaries and brokers for this business and we have no indication that our competitive position would be negatively impacted by the RIS issue.
Erik Bass - Autonomous Research: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from UBS. Please go ahead.
John M. Nadel - UBS: Hey, good morning. So just a question on cost initiative. The $800 million of expenses through 2020, do we know yet, have you told us whether all of that would be expected to drop to the bottom line or would some of that be expected to be reinvested into the business? And how much of that $800 million is in the numbers today?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Hey, John, it's John.
John M. Nadel - UBS: Hey, John.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: How you doing? I would go back to that slide that we put in the supplemental deck, right, where we showed the ratios, and let's start there. So, remember, we think, as I emphasized, we think the annual expense ratio is the best metric. If you look over 2015 to 2017, we're down about 100 basis points and you think that we have roughly $45 billion in revenue, we have about $400 million of savings. And that effectively goes to the bottom line. That's pre-tax, but that's the improvement in our profit margin, as I said. So, yeah, the short answer to your question on the $800 million is, yes, we'd expect that to be an improvement in profit margin post all the actions being taken 2020 on.
John M. Nadel - UBS: Got it, thank you. And then I have a question on allocated equity for two of the segments. For Holdings, allocated equity is down pretty significantly in the first quarter versus the level you guys were allocating last year. And I think that makes some sense, right? That should track reasonably similar, I assume, to revenues declining. You can affirm that or not. But then what was surprising to me was Asia, where allocated equity was up pretty significantly and it doesn't – and I think you've got two things going on in Asia: One, you've been moving more toward fee-based businesses, I believe, and, two, the risk-oriented business there, the higher capital required business there I thought was shrinking.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: John, I'm going to take my 48-hour pass go card on this one, if that's all right. But, yeah, we'll get back to you on that in more detail.
John M. Nadel - UBS: Appreciate it. I'll look forward to talking to you offline.
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: All right, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Just a question on the TSA fees and thanks for breaking that out. That $79 million that you booked this quarter, I was just curious why we didn't see any of that in the fourth quarter and then how would you expect that $79 million to kind of trend over the next year or so?
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Sorry, Suneet, can you say that one more time.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes, $79 million of TSA fees in your supplement, right? And so I assume that's related to the Brighthouse TSA arrangement that you have. Since the thing was spun out in August, I would have expected some in the fourth quarter, but there weren't any. So curious about that, but then also how do you expect those TSA fees to kind of trend over the course of 2018? I know Brighthouse has talked about really trying to clamp down on those as quickly as possible.
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, I'd say a year from now, there's probably a decline in $30 million to $40 million of TSA fees is expected. But I think it depends on how fast the exits occur and that's not a real precise number, but give or take.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And is that what's captured in that original Investor Day slide when you show the cost savings and you went from, like, 2018 to 2019 and there was actually a $100 million pickup in stranded overhead; is that essentially capturing the loss of these TSA fees?
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, there was a separate line on strand and you saw that uptick and that is effectively the roll-off of the TSA fees.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. And then the last one is just on the expense initiative costs. I thought that maybe last quarter you'd told us $275 million would be expected to hit the operating results in 2018. Seems like first quarter, you're running a little bit less than that, the annualized rate. Should we expect that $275 million is still kind of a good number for 2018 and so we'll see a pickup in that over the subsequent quarters?
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, so we're still aligned to what we provided at Investor Day in 2016. So like you said, we said we'd get gross saves of $400 million in 2017. I think you can see the math is there. And then, we're expecting to get another $300 million -$275 million or whatever, roughly, during the course of 2018. And then, I'd just say on the quarter, as I said in my prepared remarks, we think it's very important to focus on the annual expense ratio. Now, we gave you Q1 2018 as a reference, but even 2017 you saw varying quarter-to-quarter expense ratios, so we really think looking at the trend of the annual rate is probably the best way to think about it.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. All my questions have been answered.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. First question I had was just on RIS. Could you discuss the headwind you'd expect from three-month LIBOR increasing? Like would the costs of crediting be expected to go up? And it looked like the NII yield there was a bit higher this quarter. Is there any floating rate I should be thinking about or should that continue to trend down as it has the last few quarters?
John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Alex, it's John. I think the simple answer at this time is probably just to put you back to the outlook call. We gave you those sensitivities. We think they're holding well, and if you were to use those relative to what happened in the quarter, I think you'll see that they still hold so.
John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.: And that brings us to the top of the hour. We're going to have to shut the call down to let everybody move on to the next one. Thanks, everybody, for your participation and we'll talk to you throughout the quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factor section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.
John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. On this call we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible, because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. You may have noticed that last night we released an expanded set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John Hele will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. Understanding there is a lot to unpack today, if need be, we will extend our Q&A session beyond the top of the hour. Still, in fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Most of my comments this morning will focus on the issue within our Retirement and Income Solutions business that caused us to delay earnings and take an after-tax charge of $331 million or $510 million pre-tax. Simply put, this is not our finest hour. We had an operational failure that never should have happened and it is deeply embarrassing. We are undertaking a thorough review of our practices, processes and people to understand where we fell short and how we can reset the bar at the high level people have come to expect from us over our 150-year history. The Board of Directors is fully engaged on this issue as well. Let's start with MetLife's decision to postpone its earnings release by two weeks. The question we have been getting is, if you knew about this issue on December 15, why couldn't you report earnings as planned on January 31? What we did not know until late in the closing process is that we would have a material weakness and would need to make revisions to our financial statements going back five years. This created a significant amount of work. Rather than to rush the process and risk an error, we decided to take an extra two weeks to provide the most accurate information possible. As you know, we preannounced our high-level financial results on January 29, and our underlying performance in the quarter was solid. We reported fourth quarter net income of $2.1 billion, which reflects the current period after-tax impact of $70 million for the group annuity reserve addition. The remainder of the charge is accounted for as revisions to prior period financial statements. John Hele will discuss the impact and geography of the reserve addition and cover our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance in greater detail Let me describe what happened and how this came to light. MetLife has been in the group annuity business for a very long time. The charge we took relates to a business we wrote going back decades. All the people in pension plans whose obligations we now assume are already retired and in pay status. By contrast, in earlier periods, some of them were not yet in pay. They had earned the benefit, but were years or even decades away from retirement and often had left their companies. These type of annuitants are not always easy to find. What became clear to us is that what had been standard protocol for finding retirees who were owed benefits was no longer sufficient. Recently, the Department of Labor has been urging companies that sponsor pension plans to do a better job of finding their own unresponsive and missing participants. A pilot program MetLife conducted in 2016 and 2017 to affirm that with better outreach we could establish contact with more people. In the 1990s, MetLife established a practice of releasing reserves when the company could not establish contact with an annuitant. In retrospect, based on the process we had in place, this was an error. The reserves released in any single period were not material to MetLife's financial statements. But over time, it led to the charge we announced two weeks ago. In October, when this issue was brought to the attention of the new head of our U.S. business, Michel Khalaf, and me, we moved with a strong sense of urgency to make it right. This has not excused the organizational failure to escalate the issue sooner. We needed to do three things: establish what happened; improve our processes to do a better job locating retirees; and assure that we pay everyone we find, as we always do. As we noted publicly in December, we launched an assessment into what happened. While I can report that to-date MetLife has not found any evidence of intentional wrongdoing, I can also tell you that we are taking action to hold people accountable. In addition, we have taken steps to strengthen our processes for finding unresponsive and missing annuitants. These include additional mailings, certified mailings, phone calls and the use of additional third-party firms specializing in locating missing participants. For everyone we find, we will commence payments as soon as they elect to start their benefits. We'll also pay interest on back payments for those we find. The interest rate will be comparable to that used by the Federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and this amount is already reflected in the $331 million reserve charge we took. For context, MetLife's group annuity reserves in the RIS business are roughly $40 billion. MetLife's core purpose is providing financial protection to our customers. Central to that purpose is the timely payment of benefits, which makes this issue especially distressing to me. I am deeply disappointed that we fell short of our own high standards. Our customers deserve our best efforts to find and pay them. We will do better. I wish this issue have been escalated earlier for remediation, MetLife discover the issue itself, self-reported it to our primary regulator, publicly disclosed it, and is taking all necessary steps to fix it. I will now discuss some of the ramifications of the group annuity issue. As mentioned, we took a charge to restore reserves previously released as well as accrued interest. Most of the charge is associated with periods prior to 2017. Given the size and nature of the issue, management has identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. This deficiency is only related to group annuity reserves. The material weakness we identified had two components. First, we had a lack of adequate controls over the administrative and accounting practices that led to the release of the reserves. Historically, MetLife would try to reach annuitants twice – once when they approached the normal retirement age of 65 and a second time when they approached the required minimum distribution age of 70.5. As noted, we improperly released reserves for those annuitants who were unresponsive after the second attempt. The second component was failure to escalate sooner. The reserve release process issues were not communicated or escalated on a timely basis throughout MetLife, which hindered our ability to identify and address them. We are working hard to remediate the material weakness and expect to make progress in 2018. John Hele will discuss the material weakness further. Once the scope of the group annuity issue became clear, prudence dictated a global review of similar administrative and accounting processes across the company. This review, which was started in December 2017, is now complete. The review did not identify any additional material issues. And the amount of the charge fall slightly below our preannounced range. We are also cooperating with our regulators on this matter, including the New York Department of Financial Services as our primary insurance regulator as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission as our securities regulator. I would reiterate that this is an issue MetLife self-identified and self-reported. The group annuity business is an important business to MetLife that leverages many of the company's core competencies, including asset management, liability management and underwriting. We have been among the industry leaders in this business for decades and expect to remain so. We take seriously the responsibilities we bear. Enhancing our administrative procedures in this business will position us to better serve our customers. Before I close, I want to update you on our capital management activities. During the fourth quarter, we completed repurchases on our prior $3 billion authorization and began repurchases on our most recent $2 billion authorization. All told, we repurchased $621 million of shares in the fourth quarter and returned more than $1 billion to shareholders overall, including dividends. We've continued buying in the market in 2018, repurchasing $391 million of our shares and have $1.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. To be clear, the capital management plan that we discussed on our outlook call remains in effect. We intend to complete our $2 billion authorization and execute the exchange offer for our remaining stake in Brighthouse before the end of 2018. In conclusion, I want to reiterate how committed we are to making the necessary changes at MetLife. I am well aware of our recent history. We have had a number of charges that took the market by surprise. At the same time, I believe the strategy we have put in place for MetLife is correct. My goal for the company and the goal of this entire management team is to leave MetLife better than we found it. In our view, that means simpler, less capital-intensive and with more predictable free cash flow. We are confident that MetLife's strict capital budgeting process will position the company to perform well in any economic environment. Our task now is to insist on the same level of discipline in how we execute. It is not enough for MetLife to have the right strategy; operationally, we must have a culture of continuous improvement and we will. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele.
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I would like to begin my remarks today by reviewing the 4Q 2017 supplemental slides that we released last evening along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. These slides address several key areas of focus for investors: fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results; our group annuity reserve charge; Long Term Care; and the impacts from tax reform. I will start with comments on our fourth quarter results and business highlights starting on page 3. This schedule provides a reconciliation of net income and adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter. Net income was $2.1 billion and was $1.4 billion higher than adjusted earnings of $678 million, primarily due to the benefits from tax reform. I will provide more details on tax reform later in this presentation. Net investment gains and net derivative losses were relatively modest and essentially offset in the quarter. Overall, the investment portfolio and hedging program performed as expected. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $42.24 as of December 31, up 4% versus the sequential quarter, primarily due to the impacts of tax reform. As of January 1, 2018, we expect this amount to decrease by approximately 2% with the adoption of certain new accounting rules. This is primarily driven by a one-time reclassification from retained earnings to AOCI due to the impacts of tax reform that are attributable to AOCI, but were required to be reported in net income in 2017. Our notable items in the quarter are highlighted on page 4. We've quantified these notable items into five categories that we highlighted in our news release and quarterly financial supplement. First, we had a one-time negative impact of $298 million after-tax, or $0.28 per share, primarily due to the one-time repatriation transition tax on our unremitted overseas earnings and the revaluation of deferred taxes to the new tax rate of 21% Second, various insurance adjustments, including $62 million after-tax or $0.06 per share due to the group annuity reserve charge, reduced adjusted earnings by $110 million after-tax or $0.10 per share. Third, litigation and other settlement costs, including the strengthening of asbestos reserves, reduced adjusted earnings by $55 million after-tax or $0.05 per share. Fourth, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $42 million after-tax $0.04 per share. And fifth, favorable prior-year developments increased adjusted earnings by $7 million after-tax or $0.01 per share. Catastrophe losses were $18 million after-tax, in line with plan. In total, notable items in the quarter reduced adjusted earnings by $498 million or $0.47 per share. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $1.2 billion or $1.11 per share. On page 5, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items, by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were down 2% year-over-year. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were $1.11, up 3%, and up 2% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Positive year-over-year drivers in the quarter included solid volume growth, lower expenses and favorable underwriting as well as strong equity market results. These were offset by weaker investment margins and an unusually lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016. Recurring investment income was essentially flat from a year ago. In the quarter, our global new money yield stood at 3.23% compared to an average roll-off rate of 3.98%. We would expect our new money rate and roll-off rate to converge at roughly 3% on the 10-year U.S. Treasury. Pre-tax variable investment income was $216 million in the quarter, within our quarterly guidance range of $200 million to $250 million. As a large investor in the U.S. fixed income market, MetLife will benefit if higher economic growth leads to higher interest rates and an extension of the credit cycle In regards to business performance, Group Benefits had another strong quarter, with adjusted earnings up 32% quarter-over-quarter. The primary drivers were strong non-medical health underwriting and good expense control. Group Benefits is a cornerstone franchise for MetLife and delivered stellar results in 2017, highlighted by adjusted earnings growth of 26%, sales rising 19%, and PFO growth of 5% excluding the impact from the loss of a large dental contract, as previously discussed. Adjusted earnings in Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, continue to be pressured by the flatter yield curve. The 20% year-over-year decline, excluding notable items, was driven by lower interest and underwriting margin, including an $8 million after-tax in-quarter impact related to the group annuity reserve charge. This was partially offset by volume growth and lower expenses. Despite the recent challenges, RIS is an important business for the company, which aligns well with our strategy and insurance fundamentals , specifically the pension risk transfers, our view of the business has not changed. In 2017, we had record PRT sales of $3.3 billion and expect 2018 to be another active year. Property & Casualty, or P&C, had a strong quarter as adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, doubled year-over-year, driven by favorable auto underwriting results. Auto results have benefited from targeted rate increases and management action to create value. For the full year 2017, P&C adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were 45% higher than 2016. The key driver was the auto combined ratio, which improved 5.8 percentage points in 2017. Asia adjusted earnings were down 12% year-over-year, primarily due to tax items in Japan, the impact of the change in Japan's effective tax rate and the reversal of tax accrual in the fourth quarter 2016. Asia sales were up 1% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were flat year-over-year as the shift to foreign currency whole life has proven successful. FX life sales were up 27%, while Yen life sales were down 77%. FX life sales accounted for 90% of total life sales in Japan this quarter. Emerging market sales in Asia were up 26%, driven by China, which continues to have strong agency growth. Latin America adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were up 2% and flat on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth and more favorable market impacts, offset by higher initiative and non-recurring expenses, the fee reduction in Provida and taxes. LatAm PFO growth was up 8% and up 5% on a constant currency basis. Growth has been tempered by the pension market in Chile and the large group market in Mexico. Business performance in Provida has been promising as net transfers in this business were positive during the fourth quarter for the first time in over a year. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 10% and 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth in Turkey and Western Europe and favorable expense margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 17%, excluding notable items, primarily due to lower interest margin and higher expenses. While the quarters have been noisy as MetLife Holdings move through the separation, the year overall has produced solid results. Adjusting for notable items, earnings for the full year 2017 were down 6% from the previous year. Favorable equity markets and lower expenses were key contributors as well as solid life underwriting results. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $133 million, excluding notable items related to tax reform, our unit cost initiative and litigation expenses. This was within the quarterly range implied in our 2017 guidance and compares favorably to an adjusted loss of $152 million in the fourth quarter 2016. I will provide an update to our 2018 guidance for Corporate & Other shortly. Now let me address the group annuity reserve charge and related material weakness identified by MetLife's management, which required a revision of our prior financial statements. Page 6 provides some background on our RIS group annuity business. The practice of releasing group annuity reserves that required correction go back approximately 25 years. The subgroup most impacted by the group annuity reserve charge is approximately 13,500 of the 600,000 annuitants, or approximately 2% of the overall population. To further size this business, total group annuity reserves are roughly $40 billion. Page 7 provides a breakdown of the group annuity reserve charge. In total, the charge was $510 million pre-tax, which is below the bottom end of the guidance of $525 million to $575 million pre-tax estimated on our January 29 press release. On an after-tax basis, the charge was $331 million using the U.S. tax rate of 35% for all periods. In total, the correction for prior-year periods was $372 million pre-tax, or $241 million after-tax. You will notice in our quarterly financial supplement that some of the historical quarterly and annual numbers for 2016 and 2017 have changed slightly. You can see the impact summarized in the revision to prior-period net income slide in the appendix. These changes are a function of the historical revisions that we performed during the fourth quarter. The small differences reflect the correction of minor prior-period errors, which was required in the U.S. GAAP accounting. For those who produce financial models of MetLife, this will unfortunately require some updating on your part. Let me turn to page 8 to discuss the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting identified by management during the fourth quarter. As Steve described, the material weakness is only related to the group annuity business with respect to two elements: administrative practices and escalation. On page 9, I will offer more detail on our efforts to remediate the material weakness. Relative to our group annuity administrative practices, we are correcting the reserve release practices to ensure improvements are made. These would include earlier, more frequent and simpler communication to annuitants as well as the use of certified mail, additional external databases and more locator services, among other things. Relative to escalation, we are reviewing our practices regarding timely communication and knowledge-sharing throughout the company. We are hiring advisors to conduct a comprehensive analysis, which will be overseen by our Chief Risk Officer, Ramy Tadros. We believe these measures will strengthen MetLife's internal control over financial reporting. Our efforts to remediate the material weakness are ongoing and we expect to make progress throughout 2018. Turning to page 10, let me address another topic that may be on your mind: Long Term Care. We announced our exit from Long Term Care in 2010. We were historically conservative in our policy provisions and conservative in new business underwriting. For example, only 16% of our policies offer lifetime benefit, and the vast majority reimburse actual incurred expenses as opposed to being cash plan. Our largest blocks were fully underwritten at issue for medical and cognitive impairments. Beyond that, our Long Term Care book of business is around 40% group with generally lower ages, smaller policies and less generous provisions than individual. Our book of Long Term Care generates annual premium of roughly $750 million aided by consistent rate action. In 2017, these were 7% on average across the full LTC book. We have approximately $11.5 billion of GAAP LTC liabilities and $14 billion of statutory LTC liabilities. Collecting more premiums sooner makes a big difference in the economic performance of the block. We started that process early, making our first rate increase request with the states in 2008. We will review updated assumptions each year for loss recognition in statutory and cash flow testing. Based on our 2017 results, we have a comfortable margin about current loss recognition. We also update claim reserve assumptions each year to reflect actual experience. As a New York-domiciled company, we are subject to New York state regulatory oversight. Among other things, this means we do not factor in future rate increases into our reserve calculations. Lastly, we do all of our own claims administration, which means we control the checkbook rather than a third-party administrator. While we no longer write this business, we've been involved for a long time and that experience has been reflected in our Long Term Care results. Now let's talk about tax reform on page 11. We have a one-time net benefit of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter as a result of tax reform. The remeasurement of our deferred tax liability resulted in a benefit of $1.4 billion, which includes a $128 million negative impact to adjusted earnings. This was less than our guidance that we provided on the outlook call of $1.5 billion to $2 billion due to fourth quarter items and the group annuity reserve charge. In addition, we have a $170 million charge to adjusted earnings due to a one-time repatriation transition tax. Looking ahead, we now expect the company's 2018 effective tax rate to be between 18% to 20%, which is lower than our prior guidance of 23% to 25%. In regards to cash taxes, we expect a modest reduction in our annual U.S. cash tax liability and consistent with the recent past, cash tax payments to the IRS will not be significant for at least six years. Next, I would like to update you on some of the guidance we provided on our outlook call in December. Following tax reform, our guidance in 2018 for the Corporate & Other adjusted loss moves to $650 million to $850 million. This reflects the new lower 21% corporate tax rate. Relative to the prior guidance range, the increased Corporate & Other adjusted loss is expected to be more than offset by lower taxes and higher adjusted earnings in our U.S. businesses. Other points of guidance provided on our outlook call such as interest rate and other sensitivities were also based on a 35% tax rate. For those, simple math can get you to the sensitivities associated with a 21% tax rate. We are comfortable maintaining our target free cash flow ratio at 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings, on average, over 2018 and 2019. There are a couple considerations. Tax reform will impact the timing of our tax cash flows and separately, there's an impact from the group annuity reserve addition. Taken together, we expect the ratio to be at the lower end of the range over the two-year period. As Steve indicated earlier, we anticipate no change to our capital management plan, as articulated on our outlook call in December. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.7 billion at December 31, which is down from $6.5 billion at September 30. The $800 million decrease in holdco cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividends, holding company expenses as well as a $1 billion debt maturity in December. In addition, our 2017 free cash flow ratio was 75% of adjusted earnings, excluding notable items and cash flows related to Brighthouse. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2017, we estimate our U.S. combined RBC ratio will remain above 400% on a NAIC basis. Preliminary full-year 2017 U.S. statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.4 billion and net earnings were approximately $2.4 billion. Statutory operating earnings reflects favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher reserves and higher taxes. Net earnings were also impacted by losses on derivatives. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.5 billion as at December 31, 2017. Statutory operating earnings were offset by dividends and derivative losses. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 863% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. Overall, while our group annuity issue presented challenges in the fourth quarter, our cash and capital position remains strong. I would like to add my personal regret over the delay in reporting. I appreciate your patience and I look forward to your questions. And, with that, I'd turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, and good morning. I just have a question about the guidance for higher Corporate after-tax losses. Just to be clear, there's no change in guidance at the enterprise level because the operating segments will produce higher earnings due to a lower tax rate, which will more than offset the higher after-tax loss in Corporate?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Sean. This is John. Yes, that's true. It's not intuitive, if you look at the net number that we talk about with the Corporate loss, and that's because the Corporate pre-tax loss is larger than you may think, and there's more tax credits than normal than the 35%. So, the total change, the increase in our range of $200 million is totally and only due to tax reform changes and this will be mitigated by better margins in the rest of our business.
Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then I have a question about the reviews that the New York Department and the SEC are doing regarding the group annuitants. Are they essentially doing competing reviews or are they taking the findings of your internal review? I'm just wondering if you can give us any context of your understanding of how their processes are working.
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Sean, it's Steve. Each has its own regulatory arena. The New York Department of Financial Services is obviously our primary insurance regulator and SEC is for securities matter, so each has its own arena, and we're cooperating with both fully. And we can't predict exactly how long this will play out. It's a process that will take its own course.
Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC: Hey. First question, Steve, just in terms of the internal global claims review you did across all your businesses, it seem to wrap up pretty quickly, considering just the timing here. Can you talk a bit about your confidence in the depth of the review and the fact that you're highly confident this is isolated – this situation is isolated to only the group annuity business?
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Sure, Tom. When this matter came to light, we made sure we had the resources within countries and regions to put all necessary people against this review to get to the right answers; meaning, determining exactly what might else be out there in the same arena. And people are working very, very long hours, evenings, weekends, et cetera. And as reported, we have found nothing material coming out of that review, which was encouraging. To your point, there's always things in an insurance company, over the years, that you look at. You may change your estimates, change your actuarial assumptions and the like, or find new and better ways of doing things. But this was a very extensive and thorough review of our international operations.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC: Got you. And just my follow-up, John, you had mentioned you have a comfortable margin above loss recognition for Long Term Care. Can you help a little bit, at least directionally, on the quantification of that? Are we talking about a margin of 10%, closer to 50%? Just any directional help on that would be appreciated.
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: In U.S. GAAP, it's over 10% but not 50%. How's that for a range?
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC: Got it. Somewhere above 10%, below 50%. Okay.
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, it's definitely above 10%. And it's all in the assumptions you make and how you think about it. So, it is complex, but we do a lot of work on this and we continue to work to have a better claims management as well as appropriate rate filings with the state. So, this is an ongoing effort we've had. We've had it for quite a long time on this. And don't forget, on a statutory basis, we tested more conservative assumptions than GAAP and you can see the statutory reserves are larger than the GAAP reserves.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. I had a few questions. First, on your Asia sales, I think they were up just overall around 1%. And if I look at Japan, obviously, there's a product mix shift going on. So, first question on that is what are the annuities that you're selling in Japan? Because that's the product that seem to grow a lot. And then secondly, if you look at non-Asia sales, those were actually up less than 2%, as well. So, what's going on, if you could give us some detail there?
Steven J. Goulart - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Jimmy. It's Steve Goulart. Let me start and I'll ask Sachin Shah to comment a little bit more on Japan. But basically, when you look at all of Asia as a region, it was really some very strong performance and then some sort of flattish performance. But when you look at emerging markets, essentially our sales were up over 25% there on a year-over-year basis, and that was led by China where sales were up over 30%. Offsetting that a little bit were performances in Korea and Hong Kong on a quarterly basis, and those are just unusual events. The timing of a sales campaign in Korea was one impact. In Hong Kong, there were some regulatory changes that I think ended up with sort of a fire sale result when you look at the fourth quarter of last quarter. So, overall, again, very strong, we're very pleased with sales. I think Japan was flat and a lot of that had to do with change in mix. But let me ask Sachin if he wants to comment anymore on Japan.
Sachin N. Shah - Metlife Insurance KK: Can you hear me? Okay. Sorry, Jimmy, a little technical glitch there. In the Retirement segment, we sell predominantly fixed annuity products. These products are fixed-term products, typically 3 years, 5 years or 10 years in term and the customer is targeting a specific maturity period and looking for a target return. These products also have MVAs built into them, and so the customer is bearing the foreign currency and market risk in the product.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And are they primarily forex as opposed to Japanese yen products?
Sachin N. Shah - Metlife Insurance KK: All of our life insurance products, 90% of our life insurance sales and 100% of our annuities sales are foreign currency products.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thanks. And then for John, on the Brighthouse sale, I realize you had been buying back stock through the whole review process. Can you give us just some color on the process that you have to go through for selling Brighthouse? I think there's a limited window given that you have to do a filing and then after that there's a little bit of a quiet period or so. So, what's the process that you'd need to go through and is it even feasible that you could do it in the first-by the end of the first quarter?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Jimmy. This is John. Let me follow up on your Asia question. You're right, the Other Asia wasn't up quite as much. Steve was referring to emerging markets were very strong, but in Korea and Hong Kong, there's some timing points of sales quarter-over-quarter. If you look at the full year, though, for Other Asia, the growth of sales is up 20%. So, there's some timing quarter-to-quarter, but we're very pleased with our Other Asia sales growth in the year. And on BHF, you're right, we have to file with the SEC for some work for some no-action relief and we need a long enough open window, 20 days of trading days in order to walk through it. And sometimes it goes a few days beyond that, so we have to pick a window where we don't run afoul of various information. So, the timing we haven't exactly set on yet, but it will have to be in a long enough window and we will let you know when we get it filed and going.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then just lastly, have you disclosed or are you able to disclose what your interest rate assumption is for your Long Term Care reserves?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: The interest rates in GAAP start at the current curve and slowly grade like all of our U.S. GAAP assumptions to a (42:55) 10-year Treasury out about 11 years from now and is statutory. It's tested at various different rates, including level rates forever.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I was just hoping you could touch upon if we should think about any real go-forward financial impact following the group annuity issue in terms of either elevated expenses related to the remediation efforts or if you think it will impact your growth in the RIS business?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Sure, why don't I take some expenses. We're doing these outreach programs and doing additional efforts there, we expect those costs would be absorbed by the business. There may be for the investigation we're doing led by the Chief Risk Officer could be some slightly higher expenses throughout the year, but we believe those would be still within the Corporate & Other range that we've given you for expenses for the overall year. And I'll turn it over to Michel to speak about the business impacts.
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: So obviously, Ryan, our focus and energy will be on resolving the issue that we disclosed and finding as many of the missing annuitants as possible and initiating payments to them. Having said that, we have a lot of expertise, we're a leader in the PRT space. We have a lot of expertise in terms of asset management, underwriting, liability management. And last year, as a matter of fact, we had a record year in terms of new business in PRT. So we're going to continue to be active in this market and we believe that with our enhanced process, which will be a best-in-class, we will remain competitive and we'll continue to win new business.
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hey, Ryan. This is John again. I want to just add, on slide 7, we showed you the 4Q's in-quarter activity of minus $8 million after-tax. So, you should add that into future modeling that you have of that business, that amount would be roughly recurring.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Got it. And then, separately, can you discuss your view of the sustainability of tax reform benefits in your Group Benefits business versus passing through lower tax rates through pricing over time?
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, this is Michel again. So, we're going to see a benefit, but we expect that returns will normalize over time. So, if we think about our group business, obviously, renewals are done for 2018. Typically, our Group Life business has a three to five-year rate guarantee; our disability business, typically two-year guarantees; and dental is renewed annually. So, tax is a factor that goes into our pricing, it's not the only factor. A lot will depend on the competitive environment. Again, we don't compete solely on price. But we expect that over time, as business renews, as we compete for new business, we'll have to give back some of the benefit that we're getting from the tax reform.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the reviews by the New York Department of Financial Services and the SEC. One of the large banks recently was surprised with the limitations on growth by their main regulator. Do either of those regulators have any jurisdiction on your kind of forward capital management plans or your ability to grow the business?
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Suneet, I think you're referring to the Federal Reserve, which does not have authority over us.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Right. I'm talking about the specific regulators that are reviewing your group annuity issues. I'm not talking about the Federal Reserve, I'm talking about the NYDFS and the SEC, do they have any jurisdiction on those plans?
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: On the issue of what exactly you're asking?
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): In terms of your ability to return capital. Like, these reviews are ongoing, right? So, we don't know what the outcome is going to be, but I guess my question is, is there something that could surprise us in terms of what they ultimately decide related to your capital management plan, that's my question.
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Well, the DFS approves dividends, but I think the case you're referring to, I don't anticipate that being applicable to us.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just given the big move-up in rates that we saw in the first quarter, should we be expecting a stat impact in terms of your capital at the end of the first quarter as well as a GAAP book value impact?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Suneet. It's John. Well, as you know and as we announced last year, we have changed our hedging strategy to be less sensitive to changes in interest rates than we were historically. So, there will be some impact because it's never perfect, but it should be less muted than it has been in the past.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then just lastly on the capital management plan, are you still-is that liability management component that you guided to still kind of part of your expectations for 2018 in terms of debt reduction?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Yes.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass - Autonomous Research: Hi. Thank you. John, I was hoping you could walk through more of the dynamics around tax reform on your free cash flow. And, I guess, are there places where the actual dollar amount of free cash flow is expected to increase over time?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Well, let's remember, we talk about free cash flow as a percentage of cash we get from our subsidiaries and, well, the largest being the U.S. companies, which is on a statutory basis. And there's a delay, of course, you get the dividend approved for the following year based on your last year's earnings. And then the denominator is your GAAP earnings. So, our GAAP earnings are going to go up by the change in tax reform by about 5 points. So out of the get-go, even with the same dividend and as there's like a year delay in getting this all done, we also have the charge in stat that will impact dividend capacity slightly in 2018. So, we expect, compared to where we were pre, to have some lower numbers in 2018, a little better – it will improve in 2019. So, there's a bit of timing going on. We're not currently a very large cash taxpayer in the U.S. and it will be some time before we are, so you have that dynamic going on. But we have reiterated we expect to be at the low end of the two-year average 65% to 75% over 2018 and 2019.
Erik Bass - Autonomous Research: Okay, thanks. And then is there any impact from either the reserve review or the ongoing controls remediation efforts on the timing of other projects or investments that you had planned for 2018?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: No, we will fund these additionally to what we have, and we are still working very hard on our unit cost initiative projects and all the other improvements we're making throughout the world.
Erik Bass - Autonomous Research: Okay, thank you. And then, sorry, just last, Steve, you had commented that the board is involved in the review process. Can you just expand on your comment there and what capacity they're playing?
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: They're playing their normal oversight role. The Audit Committee, in particular, and the full Board of Directors is quite involved in all the discussions that we've had internally in the company and we keep them updated on a regular basis.
Erik Bass - Autonomous Research: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. My first question is on the capital return expectations for 2018. It was sort of pointing to around the $5 billion range on the outlook call. Just want to make sure that that's still a reasonable expectation for 2018.
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Yes, that would include the buybacks we plan, the remaining $1.4 billion we have outstanding under the $2 billion authorization, the exchange of the Brighthouse shares and the common dividend.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's what I thought. Thank you. Second, is there any potential put-back exposure from Brighthouse with regard to any pension risk transfer exposure they might have to MET?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: When Brighthouse was spun and separated, we have a separation master agreement and anything prior to 1/1/2017, we have ours, they have theirs, and that's how it's set up.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, it's separate? MET has, in your view, fully addressed any potential exposure there?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Yes.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thanks. And then just a final question on tax. Should we just assume a 18% to 20% tax rate across all of MET's segments for simplicity sake or would there be different rates in different segments?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Well, there'll be different rates in different segments. Our overseas tax rate is 25%, 26-ish, and then we have the U.S. tax rate 21%, we get some tax credits from many of our investments, so you will see some changes.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning. First one was just following the move-up in the 10-year and, I guess, there's a lot of changes that have been made since the last time you guys kind of opined on ROE, is there any update to thinking about the spread on the 10-year that you'll ultimately be able to achieve as you have the unit cost program phased in?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Well, I think you're referring to the ROE target relative to the 10-year and, as we've said, this is a longer-term target. When the 10-year spikes up in a quarter, our overall company ROE will not spike up and follow instantly in the quarter. It's meant to be a general average over time. We think it makes sense now that we're at slightly higher rates as they stay in. Our earnings power will increase over time and it will move towards that. But at any small period of time moving 30 basis points, 40 basis points, there won't be a direct-it takes time for the whole portfolio to change and move. Have I answered your question correctly?
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. But just in terms of like the spread piece of it above the 10-year, I mean, is the view sort of unchanged around where you can ultimately get to?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Yes. Over time, we're 800 basis points to 900 basis points and we expect to prove even beyond that as we improve our unit cost post 2020.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And the follow-up on just the TSAs with Brighthouse, could you quantify for us how that may be impacting either – whether it be MetLife Holdings or earnings in Corporate?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah. Well, we will expect as TSAs go down, we do have higher strand that will increase slowly over time, and that's why we have this unit cost initiative to help offset that as it goes through. So, those two tend to offset each other. And as we announced, we're going to start giving you some expense ratios published with the sub details, so you can track us on a quarterly basis starting in the first quarter of 2018 and you'll be able to see how all this folds out over time.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg from Janney. Please go ahead.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Good morning. Thank you. So, with the 10-year up over 40 bps since the beginning of the year, you had given us the fourth quarter new money versus roll-off rate. Can you give us some idea where that might stand today?
Steven J. Goulart - MetLife, Inc.: Probably not a lot of color, Larry. This is Steve Goulart, by the way. But it's hard when you look at the new money yield. It moves around a lot on a quarter-by-quarter basis, just given our overall activity for the quarter, how much we're reinvesting, whether that's coming off of roll-off and what sort of roll-off and where we're seeing relative value and what our needs are for portfolio investing strategies in that quarter. So really just looking at a quarter-to-quarter basis I think is probably not the best way to think about what's going on. You want to think about long-term trends. And, again, we like the fact that interest rates continue to move up. We think that's going to be good for the portfolio overall and good for our earnings on the portfolio. So I would expect that number in general to increase, but, again, on an actual quarter-to-quarter basis, it's really impacted by a lot of the intra-quarter activity.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Okay. But in terms of the talking about convergence of the two at a 3% 10-year, assume that happened over a period of time, should we assume that there's kind of a linear relationship along that path in how that spread would compress?
Steven J. Goulart - MetLife, Inc.: Well, what John was referring to was what we call our sort of roll-off/reinvest dilemma, i.e., the difference between where we're investing new money and what the roll-off yield is. And as we've said for several quarters, we do try and estimate what that would look like, at what point are we reinvesting at a breakeven level versus the roll-off securities from the portfolio, and John mentioned that's roughly 3%, probably a little bit above 3%, but there are also assumptions baked into that, too. Most importantly, that all spread relationships stay the same. Again, it's a positive trend. I mean, interest rates are heading higher. We know that as we approach a 3% 10-year, the portfolio investment options start looking better, we start eliminating some of the negative roll-off that's been impacting our portfolio yield over time, and so it's all very positive. Is it exactly linear? Never exactly linear, but the trend is certainly positive. And, again, as we approach a 3% 10-year that that will persist over time, that will be very positive for us.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then just one kind of model housekeeping. Can you just tell us where the – for the expense initiatives, where the cumulative savings initiatives stood as of year-end 2017 and what your expectation is for the cumulative savings as of the end of 2018?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: As of the end of 2017 cumulatively we're about $400 million in saves. And that was our – that's basically our target we had. Our one-time is running a little less than we had. We expect they'll get caught up, though, throughout the next two years.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: And then is there a number for year-end 2018?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, we're still basically on the original slide that we gave you for the guidance that we had and, again, we'll give you some more details of this in an easier way to follow this on an ongoing basis. The trouble of all these programs is you save money in one place, but you're growing as well, so how do you know whether it's really flowing through or not. And that's why the expense ratio will be really the key measure. That's what we check ourselves with, the board checks us with, because you have these trackings, but it's also not just saving the money in the UCI program, but making sure you're being efficient elsewhere and you're not losing margin elsewhere in your firm. And as I said, we'll give you good clarity on this during the first quarter and we'll have regular discussions on it each quarter for you.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Just want to follow on Ryan's question related to pension risk transfer. So I hear you loud and clear about your commitments to the business, but have your conversation with clients or brokers changed as a result of the incident?
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: Well, I mean, clearly – this is Michel. Clearly, Humphrey, we are engaging with our key brokers, intermediaries to bring them up to speed on the issue and also to go through what we are doing to address it and the urgency and the resources that we're putting behind addressing this issue. So we're having those conversations as we speak. And ultimately, the market will decide how it will react to this matter. I think from our standpoint, we're making sure that we do everything humanly possible to deal with this issue to find those missing annuitants and to initiate payments and to have a process in place that we believe will be best-in-class in the industry.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: So, in John's prepared remarks, he talked about the outlook for 2018 is still pretty strong compared to 2017, but given some of the discussions that you will have, should we expect some of the – I mean, the pipeline will be more back-end loaded in 2018?
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: Well, I mean, typically PRT tends to be back-end loaded. We see much more activity in the second half of the year compared to the first half. So, I mean, this 2018 could be different, but we expect it to be a typical year in this regard. I just want to also stress that PRT is one component of our RIS business. We have other components of this business that continue to perform strongly, stable value, for example, structured settlements, and our capital markets business as well. So, that's one component of our overall RIS business.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Got it. And then, so now with the review completed, are there still any risks that your auditors may issue a qualified opinion for your financial statement?
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: No.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Okay, thanks.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. I just want to confirm, with the regulatory inquiry from the SEC and the New York Department of Finance, will we receive notification at some point that their interest in the matter is concluded? Or could this be an open-ended sort of thing we never really know their position on the matter?
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Josh, they'll go through their process, and once they've felt like they've come to a conclusion, they'll let us know, and we'll certainly communicate that to the marketplace.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And do you have any reserve for legal costs associated with that or potential funds?
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: We do not. It's not something that's estimable right now, so we're not able to book that.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much and good luck.

Operator: Welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factor section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations
John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2017 earnings call. On this call we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible, because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1.09, down from $1.22 per share a year ago. Overall, it was a solid quarter, with good underwriting and volume growth. Low interest rates continue to pressure recurring investment margins, while equity markets and foreign currency had limited impact on quarterly operating results. Operating return on equity in the quarter, adjusting for Brighthouse, was 11.3%. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.13 per share, which compares to $1.27 per share on the same basis in the prior-year period. Net notable items of $0.04 per share included a net tax charge of $0.16 per share due to the repatriation of foreign cash, partially offset by a tax benefit associated with foreign dividends. In addition, we incurred $0.02 per share of cost to achieve our target of $800 million in pre-tax savings by 2020. These items were largely offset by favorable deferred acquisition costs unlocking associated with our annual actuarial assumption review and other positive insurance adjustments totaling $0.14 per share. MetLife's annual actuarial assumption review was completed during the quarter. To summarize, the review was positive to earnings, with improved expense assumptions and our traditional U.S. life insurance block being the largest contributor. Outside the U.S., there were small offsetting pluses and minuses. The net loss for the quarter was $87 million, compared to net income of $571 million a year ago. The current period net loss was driven by previously disclosed Brighthouse separation costs of $1.1 billion. John Hele will discuss the assumption review and separation costs in greater detail. During the quarter, MetLife successfully spun off 80.8% of Brighthouse Financial. This transaction was the product of the hard work and dedication of our associates and represents a key milestone in the nearly 150-year history of MetLife. Going forward, MetLife is well-positioned to grow profitably in protection and fee-based businesses, with less volatility and a more predictable and sustainable free cash flow ratio. As we have said, we are targeting a return on equity of 800 to 900 basis points over the risk-free rate, as measured by the 10-year Treasury. At the same time, we believe our new business mix will lead to a lower cost of equity capital for MetLife. The combination of higher returns and a lower hurdle rate should improve our valuation over time, and we are encouraged by the positive market reaction since the Brighthouse separation. Moving to business highlights. Within the U.S. business segment, Group Benefits reported another quarter of strong underwriting results, demonstrating our commitment to pricing discipline. Retirement and Income Solutions PFOs rose by more than 70%, driven by forward pension risk transfer sales in the quarter. Despite a quarter marked by significant storms, Property & Casualty earnings were down only 12% from a year ago, with total catastrophe losses of $86 million pre-tax. As a result of past risk mitigation efforts, MetLife's market share in the storm-impacted areas of Texas and Florida is well below our national market share. For our largest international segment, Asia, operating earnings benefited from volume growth, offset by higher taxes. As you saw earlier this week, MetLife Asia President, Chris Townsend, is leaving the company. The region will be run on a interim basis by Chief Investment Officer Steve Goulart. I am confident that Asia will remain a key driver of profitable growth and shareholder value creation for MetLife. Latin America operating earnings were aided by strong underwriting, volume growth, and foreign currency, offset by the impact of fee reductions at Provida in Chile. Last week, we announced the divestment of our Mexican Afore, a business where we lacked critical mass. This is another example of our strategic approach to the portfolio, carefully balancing internal rate of return, payback periods, and capital intensity. We determined that the capital required for this business could be put to better use supporting organic growth or funding capital management. EMEA operating earnings in the quarter reflected volume growth and disciplined expense management. Finally, MetLife Holdings operating earnings benefited from the rise in equity markets and favorable life insurance underwriting, offset by lower investment income. Turning to total company investments, recurring investment income was down 2% from a year ago, as the drag from historically low interest rates outweighed asset growth. In the quarter, our global new money yield stood at 3.53% compared to average roll-off rate of 4.29%. Pre-tax variable investment income totaled $236 million in the quarter, within our quarterly guidance range of $200 million to $250 million. As has been the case for most of 2017, private equity returns were the largest contributor to performance in the third quarter, international and global buyouts in particular. Regarding capital management, since we announced our $3 billion repurchase program in 2016, we have bought back approximately $2.8 billion of our common stock, including $505 million this quarter. We announced last night that our board of directors authorized an additional $2 billion share repurchase program. We also indicated our intent to dispose of our remaining Brighthouse Financial stock through an exchange offer for MetLife common stock during 2018, subject to market conditions and regulatory constraints. The exchange offer is governed by a separate board authorization and shares potentially exchanged will be additive to our newly announced $2 billion repurchase program. We have been very clear; cash in our balance sheet above our liquidity buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion represents excess capital and belongs to our shareholders. Absent a compelling use, such as a strategic acquisition that exceeds an appropriate risk-adjusted hurdle rate, we will return excess capital to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and common dividends. We are on track to return approximately $4.5 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2017, including common dividends. I'll now turn to regulatory matters. In a positive development, the U.S. Treasury Department released a report last week on how to regulate the insurance and asset management industries. The key recommendation was that primary regulators should focus on potentially systemic products and activities throughout the financial sector, as opposed to singling out individual firms for designation as systemically important financial institutions. Combined with the Financial Stability Oversight Council's recent de-designation of American International Group as a SIFI, we believe this report demonstrates the administration is committed to maintaining a level regulatory playing field in the insurance sector. We anticipate the Treasury Department will issue another report later this month examining the Financial Stability Council's (sic) [Financial Stability Oversight Council's] (11:01) standards and procedures for designating SIFIs. In the government appeal of the U.S. District Court decision overturning our SIFI designation, MetLife and the Financial Stability Oversight Council are scheduled to file motions on November 17 indicating how each party believes litigation should proceed in the wake of that Treasury report. MetLife's regulatory goal is to preserve fair competition within the insurance industry, which will lead to a more affordable financial protection for consumers. This point is critical. The insurance industry exists to provide people with financial help after life's most destabilizing events. MetLife's corporate forum has changed over the years. We were a stock-traded company from 1868 until 1915, and mutual from 1915 until 2000, and a stock company again for the past 17 years What has remained constant is our core purpose of providing financial protection to our customers when they need it most. This was evident after hurricanes Harvey and Irma in Texas and Florida, where MetLife dispatched its catastrophe action team to process claims on-site. Our investments in technology and data analytics, combined with our learnings from Superstorm Sandy, have allowed us to cut our processing time for auto claims in half. Our purpose is also evident in the tens of billions of dollars we pay out in claims and benefits each year. And is evidenced in our asset management business, where we use our expertise to help pension plans, insurance companies, and other financial institutions keep their promises to their customers. Our mission is protecting people against financial risks they are not able to bear on their own. That is the mission our employees are extremely proud of and it keeps us focused on our goal of ensuring that MetLife will be as successful in the next 150 years as it was in the first. Before I turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our third quarter results in greater detail, I would like to let you know that we're hosting this year's annual outlook call on December 15. I hope you will join us. Now to John.
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of our insurance underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses, and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. In addition to our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, last evening we released disclosure labeled 3Q17 Supplemental Slides that provide a walk from net income to operating earnings, as well as a schedule of our separation-related losses in the quarter. I will speak to these slides later in my presentation. The results of Brighthouse Financial were previously included as a separate operating segment. For the current quarter up to the separation date, as well as prior periods, Brighthouse Financial results have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Operating earnings in the third quarter were $1.2 billion, or $1.09 per share. This quarter included four notable items, which totaled negative $41 million that we highlighted in our news release and quarterly financial supplement. First, the actuarial assumption review completed in the third quarter for all products and other insurance adjustments increased operating earnings by $153 million after tax, or $0.14 per share. The key drivers were lower maintenance expense assumptions, positive impacts and updates to closed block projection, favorable U.S. (sic) [U.S. Life] mortality, and higher persistency in Mexico worksite marketing. In addition, favorable refinements resulted in reserve releases for life products and long-term care. We've completed loss recognition testing on long-term care that resulted in positive margins, so no need to strengthen reserves. The non-operating portion of the assumption review was a negative $41 million, mainly driven by changes in labs and other assumptions for GMIB variable annuities. Second, higher taxes due to certain discrete items totaled $167 million after-tax, or $0.16 per share. This included $180 million related to the previously announced non-cash tax charge resulting from future repatriation of approximately $3 billion of cash following the post-separation review of our capital needs. This was partially offset by a tax benefit associated with dividends from our foreign operations. In addition, favorable audit settlements in the quarter were partially offset by higher taxes related to internal financing associated with the 2003 (sic) [2013] acquisition of Provida. Adjusting for these items, the company's effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.4%, roughly in line with guidance. Third, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased operating earnings by $17 million after-tax, or $0.02 per share. And fourth, catastrophe experience above plan and prior-year development decreased operating earnings by $10 million after-tax, or $0.01 per share. Cat losses, primarily due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma, were $86 million pre-tax and $56 million after-tax, which was above the 3Q 2017 cat budget of $42 million after-tax. Adjusting for all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were down 14% year-over-year on both reported and constant currency basis. On a per share basis, operating earnings were $1.13, down 11%, and 10% on a constant currency basis. Turning to our bottom line results. We had a third quarter net loss of $87 million, or a loss of $0.08 per share. The net loss was $1.3 billion lower than operating earnings, primarily due to the loss at separation of $1.1 billion related to the spin-off of Brighthouse Financial on August 4. In addition, net derivative losses after-tax were $124 million, primarily due of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound, and the Canadian dollar. Our refreshed hedging program performed as intended in the quarter. For more details about the difference between net income and operating earnings, please refer to page 3 in our supplemental slide disclosure this quarter. Page 4 in the supplemental slides reflects the key elements of the net realized investment loss of $1.1 billion at separation. The loss was primarily due to a $1.1 billion charge to reflect the fair value of the company's retained interest in Brighthouse Financial. Simply put, this reflects carrying Brighthouse at around 60% of book value. The balance of the other items largely offset. The $1.1 billion cost of separation is approximately $300 million lower than the previous guidance in the company's 8-K filed on August 9. The difference mostly relates to intercompany deferred acquisition cost balances. The initial accounting interpretation suggests that certain DAC balances be written off post-separation, which was reflected in the $1.4 billion separation cost estimate. Upon further review by MetLife and our advisors, the DAC balances in question were determined to be attributable to MetLife, and therefore not subject to be written-off post-separation. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $40.96 as of September 30, down 20% versus the sequential quarter due to the spinoff of Brighthouse Financial. With respect to third quarter underwriting margins, total company operating earnings were higher by approximately $0.10 per share versus the prior quarter, after adjusting for notable items in both periods. This was primarily due to lower mortality and dental claims in the U.S., as well as favorable claims experience in Latin America, primarily in Mexico. The group life mortality ratio was 85.0%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 89.3% and at the low end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. Overall, group Life results reflected lower claim incidents and severity. The group non-medical health interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 74.7%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 76.9% and below the 2017 annual target range of 76% to 81%. Favorable underwriting results were primarily driven by dental. MetLife Holdings interest-adjusted benefit ratio for life products was 48.0%, and 51.2% after adjusting for notable items discussed earlier. This result was favorable to the prior-year quarter of 59.9% after adjusting for notable items, and below the annual targeted range of 53% to 58%. Turning to investment margins, the weighted average of the three product spreads presented in our QFS was 144 basis points in the quarter, down 23 basis points year-over-year. Pre-tax variable investment income, or VII, was $236 million and within our 2017 quarterly guidance range of $200 million to $250 million. Strong private equity performance was offset by weak prepayments. Product spreads, excluding VII, were 110 basis points this quarter, down 28 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. Overall, lower investment margins in the quarter reduced EPS by approximately $0.12 per share. The operating expense ratio was 18.5% in the current quarter, after adjusting for the notable item related to the unit cost initiative. The 30 basis points improvement in the operating expense ratio year-over-year was largely due to strong pension risk transfer sales. Excluding pension risk transfer sales, or PRT sales, in both periods, the operating expense ratio was 109 basis points unfavorable to the prior-year quarter. This was primarily due to higher employee benefits catch-up, as well as higher expenses related to growth in Latin America and Asia. Overall, less favorable expense margins contributed to $0.11 of EPS decline year-over-year. I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $241 million, up 30%, and 39% adjusting for notable items in the prior year quarter. The primary drivers were strong group life and non-medical health underwriting. Group Benefits operating PFOs were $4.1 billion, up 1% year-over-year. PFO growth was negatively impacted by the loss of a large dental contract in May. Excluding its impact, PFO growth was 4% and within our guidance range of 3% to 5%. Group Benefits sales were up 22% year-to-date, with growth across all products and markets. Sales are at near record levels, as a large case market has seen more activity in 2017, and we are winning in line with our expectations. We've also seen persistency continue to be favorable, and good sales growth in our midsize and small employer markets, fueled by continued strong voluntary sales momentum. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, reported operating earnings of $254 million, down 18% year-over-year, and 20% excluding all notable items. The primary drivers were lower investment margins, driven by continued spread compression and less favorable underwriting. RIS operating PFOs were $2.5 billion, up 71%, driven by four large pension risk transfer sales in the quarter. We continue to see a good PRT pipeline of all sizes and structures. Our approach will continue to balance growth with an efficient use of capital. Excluding PRT sales, RIS PFOs were up 40%, primarily due to a large post-retirement benefit case in the quarter. Property & Casualty, or P&C, operating earnings were $51 million, down 12% year-over-year due to higher cat losses. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 45%, driven by non-cat auto results. Our P&C combined ratio, excluding cats and prior year development, was 88.9%, better than the prior year quarter of 91.3%. We continue to see improvement in our underlying auto results, which posted a combined ratio excluding cats and prior year development of 94.2%, well below the 98.2% in the prior year quarter. Auto results have benefited from targeted rate increases over the last 12 months of 9%, and we expect to take rate increases that are in line with industry in the near future. P&C operating PFOs were $899 million, up 2% year-over-year, and sales were up 1%. P&C top line growth has been pressured in the short-term from price increases and management actions to create value. Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $314 million, down 3% year-over-year and 6% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. Volume growth was offset by a higher Japan tax rate. Asia operating PFOs were $2.2 billion, down 3%, but up 4% on a constant currency basis, including a proportion of share of operating joint ventures in the region. Asia sales were up 3% on a constant currency basis, reflecting management actions to improve value in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 4% as the shift to foreign currency whole life has proven successful. FX life sales were up 26%, while Yen life sales were down 76%. FX life sales accounted for 90% of total life sales in Japan this quarter. Accident and health sales in Japan were down 4%, but we're seeing good traction in our refreshed medical products, Flexi S and Flexi Gold S, which were launched in July. We expect A&H sales to continue to gain momentum heading into the fourth quarter. Emerging market sales in Asia were up 14%, driven by continued growth in China, which was up 13% due to agency growth and the strong momentum from its new whole life critical illness product, Safeguarding Your Health. Latin America reported operating earnings of $163 million, up 23% and 13% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and volume growth. Latin America operating PFOs were $937 million, up 5% and 2% on a constant currency basis. This growth reflects the nonrenewal of a low margin large group contract in the second quarter of 2017. Excluding this nonrenewal, PFOs were up 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth in Mexico. Total sales for the region were up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA operating earnings were $71 million, down 4% year-over-year and 10% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The year-over-year decline was due in large part to several favorable nonrecurring items in 3Q 2016, which totaled $10 million. Adjusting for notable and nonrecurring items, EMEA's operating earnings were up 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by favorable expense margin and volume growth, partially offset by less favorable underwriting. EMEA operating PFOs were $634 million, up 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis, driven by growth in Western Europe and Turkey, partially offset by group medical in the Gulf. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption update in both periods, PFOs were up 5% on constant currency basis and in line with guidance. Total EMEA sales were up 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth in the Gulf and Turkey. MetLife Holdings reported operating earnings of $410 million, up 54% year-over-year, but down 12% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were lower investment margins, partially offset by favorable underwriting and strong equity market performance. MetLife Holding's operating PFOs were $1.4 billion, down 12% mostly due to separation-related impacts and runoff of the business, in line with previous guidance. Corporate & Other reported an operating loss of $336 million compared to operating earnings of $6 million in the third quarter of 2016. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, the operating loss was $152 million compared to operating earnings of $12 million in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year variance was primarily due to higher employee benefits and changes in incremental taxes to true-up the company's effective tax rate. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.5 billion at September 30, which is up from $4.6 billion at June 30. The $1.9 billion increase in HoldCo cash in the quarter reflects subsidiary dividends of $3.4 billion, including the $1.8 billion cash remittance from Brighthouse Financial prior to the spinoff, as well as share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, the acquisition of Logan Circle Partners, and holding company expenses. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date third quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.5 billion and net earnings were approximately $1.7 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $102 million from the prior year, primarily due to favorable underwriting mostly offset by lower net investment income and higher taxes. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19 billion as of September 30, essentially unchanged from December 31. Net earnings were largely offset by dividends paid to the holding company. The Japan Solvency Margin Ratio was 854% as of June 30, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife had a good third quarter in 2017, highlighted by favorable underwriting and volume growth. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong and we remain confident that the actions we are taking to implement our strategy will drive free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders, and allow us to always be there for our customers in their time of need. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator with your questions.
Operator: Okay. And one moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. First, I just wanted to clarify, I think you mentioned there was – part of the reason that the separation costs were lower was that there was a $300 million roughly lower than assumed DAC write-off. So should DAC expense be higher than otherwise as a result in the future? And if yes, what's the rough DAC write-off period for the related business?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Jimmy, this is John. This is dealing with the riders, so this will amortize through net income over like 30 years.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Not operating, though.
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: That's correct.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then on MetLife Holdings, what's your sort of desire and ability to do an annuity exchange offer, as I recognize it's harder, given that it's New York business, but is that something that you've contemplated?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: It's something we're always looking at, but we always balance with the customers' interests and what's appropriate, so, e study this carefully, but we've not done anything to-date.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just lastly, any comments on the timing of the completion of the $2 billion buyback program?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: The additional $2 billion, we still have just a little over $200 million left from the existing $3 billion authorization and we've announced an additional $2 billion and we would expect that all this will be done by the end of 2018.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Good morning. Steve, after announcing the capital plans for buybacks in the exchange offer, is it fair to say that that takes off the table much in the way of M&A over the near term? Like Australia in life insurance I think there's been some news flow on that. Or is M&A still on the table? And also, why do the exchange offer versus secondary?
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Tom. As we've said consistently, excess capital above liquidity buffer belongs to our shareholders and we kind of go down the list of things that it could be used for, dividends, share repurchases, and strategic acquisitions that clear the hurdle rate. So, all those remain on the table. I won't comment on any specific transaction, but all those uses of capital are still on the table. As to the exchange offer, that's our current intent to exchange our shares in Brighthouse for MetLife shares and our hope is to do that in the year 2018. That is subject to market conditions and regulatory issues, constraints, but that is the intent currently.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Okay. And just follow-up question is, in terms of the news of Chris Townsend joining AIG and Steve Goulart becoming the interim head, how should we be thinking about that? Steve has dual roles now. Is that truly going to become temporary? Is it possible he might take that role over? Or should we be thinking more about more extensive process, where you're looking at external and internal candidates, before making a decision on Asia?
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Chris Townsend had come to me a while back and – just to, I mean, give you a little background on this. Chris was the longest serving President of that region for a non-Asian company. So my point is that people go to those regions typically at some reasonable number of years, before people move on to do other things. So, this is not something that was a big surprise in terms of Chris doing something different. We wanted to retain Chris, but he found another opportunity. We've already begun the process for a search. We'll look both internally and externally. The search was actually already ongoing. It wasn't after Chris' announcement. It was before, the search began. So we're in process. Steve Goulart, who has experience with the Alico transaction, Steve was running M&A and he's, of course, Treasurer of our company, he was involved directly in the Alico transaction, understands that business, and he'll be overseeing the region on an interim basis, temporary basis, as we complete our work finding a replacement for Chris.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. I wanted to start with your comment about the 800 to 900 basis points above Treasury ROE target. I thought that that was sort of the guidance that you gave before you spun-off Brighthouse, so I would have expected, all else equal, that maybe that would have gone up ex-Brighthouse. Is my understanding correct, and any thoughts on that?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Suneet, this is John. When we did our Investor Day last year and gave that guidance, that was for RemainCo, that was for – excluding Brighthouse. So the 800 to 900 is for the new MetLife, and we're on track for that.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then my follow-up to that is, should we be thinking about that as the way that you guys price your products? In other words, a spread to Treasury, because I'd always thought that the way you approach pricing was more on an absolute ROE basis?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: We approach pricing to get a margin above what we expect to be the hurdle rate required by our shareholders. And that can vary around the world, because, obviously, what you invest in does change, but we seek spread and we call that value. So, as we add value to get a return on your capital that we invest in the business, we seek to get a margin above that.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just lastly, if I could, you'd mentioned in your prepared remarks the refreshed hedging strategy. Should we be thinking that the sensitivity, just with the marks on the interest rate derivatives now, will be lower as interest rates move, versus what we've seen in the past?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: With the separation of Brighthouse, we are less sensitive in total, and we also have restructured some of our derivatives that particularly make it less sensitive to – on a statutory basis, to interest rates being between – 10-year Treasury being between 1.5% and 4%, which should still fall within our stated cash flow guidance.
Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Following up on the ROE, I think at Investor Day last year, you talked about 800 to 900 basis points over the near term, but that increasing to 900 to 1,000 basis points after the cost saves are phased in and you return excess capital. Can you comment if that 900 to 1,000 is still the longer-term expectation?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Yes, but we were speaking longer term, and our cost save program goes out to 2020, so...
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. But no – we shouldn't think about any change to that?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: No change.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And then, just given the moving parts this year, can you just help us think about where you'd expect HoldCo cash to end the year, after free cash flow in the fourth quarter? And I think you also have a debt maturity?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Well, Ryan, we don't give guidance on detailed elements like that. There are a lot of moving parts, and I leave it to – you'd have to calculate those out of (40:00).
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, got it. All right. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead
Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah, thanks. I'm just wondering about the $3 billion to $4 billion liquidity buffer, given the motions on November 17. I guess my question is, if your SIFI status is settled once and for all in a manner that you would like, can that liquidity buffer come down?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Sean. The $3 billion to $4 billion is what we've done with our own internal targets for liquidity and stress testing. That does not include a SIFI buffer on it, as it stands now. Of course, we examine this on an ongoing basis as to what we think, but we always want to be certain that, in a wide range of scenarios, that we have sufficient cash to get through, and that currently our buffer is $3 billion to $4 billion.
Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, thanks. And then in a couple hours, we're going to get a tax bill allegedly. I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on how tax reform proposals could impact you, namely around the DAC tax, as well as global minimum tax, and if that would impact pricing or free cash flow.
Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Hi. It's Steve. What we've said for some time now is that we support a pro-growth tax reform package, a significantly lower marginal rate, and we're prepared to see certain preferences changed or eliminated. And we think that will be acceptable to us as a company overall. We think that will drive economic growth, which is a key factor in terms of our growth as a company, especially in the U.S. group insurance market. So that's what we're supportive of. We've also said that if there are changes in the tax code that truly put at risk our business model, then we have to press forward with our case as to why we think that would not be a positive change for not only MetLife, but for the economy. But we are not really focused on any one specific preference or provision of the code as it relates to our business.
Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass - Autonomous Research: Hi. Thank you. RIS core spreads declined materially on a sequential basis, and it's well below the recent run rate. Is this quarter spread just a function of low interest rates and the flat yield curve, so it's a reasonable run rate, or was there any other noise in the quarter?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Erik, this is John. So last year we gave guidance that the spreads we thought for the full year in 2017 for RIS would be between 1.15% and 1.40% including VII, and VII could swing between 15 to 30 basis points. So we are within those ranges so far this year. It is less than a year ago. We are seeing, of course, some spread compression both on the long end as things slowly wear off, and then also LIBOR is up a little year-over-year, so that also squeezes the business as well. But we are in line with the guidance that we've given.
Erik Bass - Autonomous Research: Got it. So you just suggest it's a little bit of a noisy quarter and not sort of to overweight this quarter's spread as the run rate?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Well, this quarter's spread was 1.35%.
Erik Bass - Autonomous Research: I guess I was looking at the 99 basis points ex-VII.
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Well, if you take -- our low end is 1.15% to 1.40% and the minus 15 to 30 basis points, you'd see even the 99 is within our guidance.
Erik Bass - Autonomous Research: Okay. And then just a question on group, where you and the industry have seen another quarter of very strong underwriting results. And I was just hoping you could comment on what you see is driving the trends for this, and do you see anything that suggests results could continue to trend favorably versus your target benefit ratios?
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Erik, this is Michel. So, as you mentioned, this has been a strong underwriting quarter in Group Benefits. Group life mortality in particular was very favorable, at the low end of our target range. This was driven by lower incidents and a positive prior year development in IB&A (44:40) reserve release. So, I mean, I would expect longer-term trends to be at the midpoint of the range that we had provided, 85 to 90. Our non-medical health results were also favorable and below the low end of the range, and that's been driven by dental trends. So group underwriting results can be volatile, as we know, quarter-to-quarter. So I wouldn't choose the third quarter as a trend, I would say.
Erik Bass - Autonomous Research: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. My first one was just on the expense initiative costs in the Corporate segment. Could you just provide an update on, I guess, how much of the expected $300 million for 2017 have been experienced year-to-date, and sort of how much is left thinking about the fourth quarter?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Alex, this is John. So we are running a little less on the investment side. The savings that we gave in the guidance to you some time ago last year at our Investor Day are flowing through. The strength of the (46:05) save is about the same as we had said, but we are spending a little less and we do expect the fourth quarter will pick up a little, we'll make some of that up. We'll probably be, when we end the whole year, maybe $70 million short of the whole amount, but we do expect to catch this up and be able to still deliver the savings as we promised out to 2020.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And are all of the year-to-date expense initiative costs in that notable item that you guys provide, or are there other costs in the Corporate segment outside of that?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: There's another piece in panorama, which is in net income, so it's booked a little lower. That's also added to it as well.
Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I have a question related to Group Benefits. So you talked about getting good momentum in voluntary products, especially in the small end of the market. Can you just talk about the overall kind of RFP activities, especially (47:30) around the corner? Where do you see in terms of potential pricing and quotes?
Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah, hi, Humphrey. Michel again. So we're having a good year in Group. On the competitive landscape front, the market environment is competitive. I would say in dental it's highly competitive. But we continue to be disciplined in terms of our approach. We tend to focus also on distributors and employers that see value beyond the lowest price. So we're able to get terms that we're comfortable with, and that's reflected in our results so far this year in terms of sales and earnings. So that's a little bit on the competitive environment. As you mentioned, voluntary is a major focus area for us and we're seeing very good momentum on this front this year. That's also helping us grow in the mid-market and we're seeing good growth in small market as well, and we think that that's sustainable.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then a question related to the exchange offer. Is there any kind of potential tax implication that we need to be aware of either from a shareholders' perspective or from MetLife's perspective?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: This is John. It's an exchange, it's actually disposition of shares.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And at this time there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Hall.
John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much, Greg, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you again at our December outlook call on December 15. Thanks very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the Company's operations and financial results in the business and the products of the Company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the risk factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone and welcome to MetLife’s second quarter 2017 earnings call. On this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures, not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and on our quarterly financial supplement. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of senior management. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Kandarian: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $1.30, up from $0.83 per share a year ago. Overall, it was a good quarter across most business segments, aided by favorable expense management and underwriting. Equity markets which rose 2.6% in the quarter, as measured by the S&P 500, provided modest boost to earnings, while low interest rates remain a headwind. Operating return on equity in the quarter was 10.3%. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.34 per share, which compares to $1.27 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. Net notable items of $0.04 per share in the quarter included costs incurred to consolidate our New York offices at 200 Park Avenue, investments to achieve our target of $800 million and after tax run rate savings by 2020, and branding efforts to support the launch of Brighthouse Financial as a standalone company. These costs were offset in part by a favorable settlement of a tax audit and a reinsurance reserve release. Net income for the quarter was $838 million, substantially higher than a year ago. Current period net income was negatively affected by net derivative losses and cost associated with the Brighthouse separation. Before I provide key business highlights for the quarter, I’d like to provide an update on the Brighthouse Financial separation, which is almost complete. All necessary approvals have been secured and Brighthouse Financial shares have been trading on a when-issued basis for the past three weeks. Last night, MetLife filed an 8-K, disclosing that Brighthouse Financial will need to increase its reserves by approximately $400 million due to refinements in legacy actuarial models. As a result, the size of the dividend MetLife expects to receive from Brighthouse Financial will be reduced from $3.4 billion to $3 billion. John Hele will discuss this matter in greater detail. On Monday, both Brighthouse and MetLife are expected to trade for the first time on a post-separation basis on their respective exchanges, NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange. We believe the separation marks an inflection point for MetLife. Over the past few years, we’ve overhauled our product offerings to ensure that the business be right, has better internal rates of return, less capital intensity, and stronger free cash flow. We believe this work is now largely complete and that MetLife is positioned to grow profitably in the protection and fee-based businesses that from the core of the new MetLife. To be clear, we remain vigilant in fixing or exiting businesses that do not create value. For example, shortly after the end of the second quarter, we made a hard decision to close our UK Wealth Management business, which could not clear its hurdle rate in the prolonged low rate environment. Nevertheless, we are confident that the heavy lifting has been done to transform MetLife into a company with less volatility and more free cash flow, which should lead to a lower cost of equity capital and ultimately a higher valuation. Turning to highlights across the business segments. The U.S. business segment saw another strong quarter of earnings and sales from Group Benefits. At separation, Group Benefits will be a largest of our growth engines in the U.S. segment. And the business we ride [ph] continues to have attractive risk and return characteristics. Retirement and Income Solutions delivered strong growth in the quarter, while maintaining pricing discipline. In our Property & Casualty, stronger auto results reflected recent pricing and underwriting improvements, while whether, both cat and non-cat at had verse impact on home operating earnings. For international businesses, operating earnings for both Asia and Latin America benefited from volume growth and higher investment margins, while operating earnings for EMEA were aided by expense control and favorable underwriting. Finally, MetLife Holdings benefited from favorable life insurance underwriting results. Moving to investments. Pretax variable investment income totaled $279 million in the quarter. Of this amount, $222 million is attributable to the new MetLife, which calls within our quarterly guidance range of $200 million to $215 million, provided on our outlook call in December. Private equity investment is the largest contributor to the performance. In the quarter, our global new money yield stood at 3.32%, compared to average roll-off rate of 4.23%. Over the past four quarters, our new money rate has averaged 3.18%. Although interest rates are higher than they were a year ago, we have not experienced the rising rates that many predicted after the U.S. presidential election. While I still believe that monetary policy is keeping rates artificially low, I also believe that elected officials need to do more on the fiscal policy front, especially through tax reform to spur faster economic growth. In the positive regulatory development, yesterday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit Court, approved MetLife’s motion to hold in abeyance the Government’s appeal of our SIFI victory. The Court directed the parties to file motions by November 17, 2017 or within 30 days of the U.S. Treasury Secretary’s report on the Financial Stability Oversight Council SIFI designation process, whichever occurs first. This decision provides the administration time to determine whether any of FSOC’s positions in this case should be reconsidered and whether it is appropriate for the government to continue to processing this appeal. Consistent with our goal of growing profitability in the right areas, on July 7th, we announced that MetLife had reached a definitive agreement to acquire Logan Circle Partners, a fixed income asset manager with more than $33 billion of assets under management. Logan Circle will be integrated with MetLife Investment Management, and strengthen our ability to provide investment management services to existing and new institutional clients. MetLife is already one of the largest life insurance investors in the world. And Logan Circle’s strong track record in public fixed income will accelerate our effort to grow our third-party asset management business. In addition to the approximately $80 billion we will manage for Brighthouse Financial, MetLife Investment Management will have more than $60 billion of additional third-party assets under management after the transaction closes. While the acquisition of Logan Circle was consistent with our strategy of growing businesses with less capital intensity and strong free cash flow, it needed to meet our financial targets as well. When we analyzed projected growth, expense synergies and tax benefits, the transaction delivered an internal rate of return above our cost of capital, an attractive cash payback period and compared favorably to repurchasing our common shares. MetLife Investment Management was another business we identified as a growth engine at our most recent Investor Day, and we will continue to grow the business organically while keeping an eye out for attractive acquisitions. Before I close, I want to update you on our $3 billion share repurchase program, which is the largest in MetLife’s history. Since we announced the program, we have bought back approximately $2.2 billion of our common shares and remain on track to fully execute the authorization by yearend. The reserve strengthening at Brighthouse Financial does not affect our current capital return plans. During the second quarter, we repurchased $952 million of our common shares. Combined with our common dividend, we returned roughly $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders, which is close to 100% of the second quarter operating earnings. In closing, we believe our transformation work combined with our capital return program will create significant value for shareholders. With that, I’ll turn the call over to John to discuss our Q2 financial results in greater detail.
John Hele: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I’ll cover our second quarter results including a discussion of our insurance underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on potential impacts on separation as well as cash and capital. In addition to our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, last night, we released disclosure labeled 2Q17 Supplemental Slides that provide a walk from net income to operating earnings for the quarter. I will speak to these slides later in my presentation. We will continue to release supplemental slides when we have complex elements in a quarter. Operating earnings in the second quarter were $1.4 billion or a $1.30 per share. This quarter includes four notable items totaling the negative $41 million that we highlighted in our news release and quarterly financial supplement. Adjusted for all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 3% year-over-year. On a per share basis, operating earnings adjusted for all notable items were $1.34, up 6% year-over-year. Turning to our bottom-line results. We had second quarter net income of $838 million or $0.77 per share. Net income was $569 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of net derivative losses of $284 million after tax and costs related to the Brighthouse Financial separation of $216 million after tax. For more details about the difference between net income and operating earnings, please refer to page three in our supplemental slide disclosure this quarter. Page four in the supplemental slides shows the attribution of the after tax net derivative loss. I would highlight three main drivers. Number one, foreign currency derivative loss of $188 million after tax, primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against several currencies including the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar. MetLife invests in non-U.S. bonds for our U.S. portfolios to provide enhanced risk diversification and incremental yield. These bonds are swapped back to the U.S. dollar, so they economically match the U.S. dollar liabilities they support. Since certain of these hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting, asymmetrical accounting treatment between the bonds and the related currency swaps drives volatility in our GAAP net income. Importantly, this FX volatility in GAAP does not exist in statutory accounting. Number two. The VA hedge program accounted for an after tax loss of $340 million, mainly in Brighthouse Financial, including the $116 million related to asymmetrical and non-economic factors. Losses related to other risks were driven by the non-market drops in account value, primarily the deduction of fees. These losses were offset by number three, interest rate net derivative gain of $295 million after-tax due to the decline in long-term rates in the quarter. Overall, $114 million of the $284 million net derivative loss was due to asymmetrical and non-economic accounting. Under U.S. GAAP, this continues to be a significant component of our derivative gains and losses each quarter as the derivatives are mark-to-market, but a significant portion of MetLife’s VA and life liabilities are not. You can find the total impact of $203 million of adjustments for asymmetrical and non-economic accounting on our net income in the second page of tables attached to the press release. Book value per share excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $51.03 as of June 30th, up 1% versus the sequential quarter as of March 31st. With respect to second quarter underwriting margins, total Company earnings were lower by approximately $0.02 per share versus the prior quarter, after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting in Brighthouse Financial accounted for approximately $0.05 of the total decrease. This was primarily due to the previously disclosed impact from the loss of the aggregation benefit in variable in universal life and the second quarter 2016 modeling changes. Excluding Brighthouse Financial, underwriting earnings were higher by proximately $0.03 per share year-over-year, this is due to favorable underwriting in the U.S., primarily in group non-medical health and retail life within MetLife Holdings. The group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio was 76.9%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 78.9% and within the 2017 annual target of 76% to 81%. Favorable underwriting results were primarily driven by dental. MetLife Holdings interest adjusted benefit ratio for life products was $51.1%, driven by favorable mortality. This result was favorable to the prior year quarter of 59.4% after adjusting for notable items and below the targeted range of 53% to 58%. Turning to investment margins. The weighted average of the three product spreads presented in our QSS was 150 basis points in the quarter, down 20 basis points year-over-year. Pre-tax variable investment income or VII, was $279 million versus $285 million in the prior year quarter, as lower prepayments were offset by stronger private equity performance. Product spreads excluding VII were 122 basis points this quarter, down 18 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. Overall, lower investment margins in the quarter accounted for approximately $0.09 of EPS underperformance year-over-year. The operating expense ratio in the current quarter was 22.0% and 21.1% adjusting for all notable items, benefitting from higher pension risk transfers sales and the sale of the MetLife Premier Client Group to MassMutual in the prior year. Operating expense margins, adjusting for all notable items, were less favorable to the prior year quarter by $0.02 per share. Costs associated with the build of Brighthouse Financial as a standalone company, higher variable expenses and a prior year adjustment which reduced employee benefits, were partially offset by lower operating expenses due to sale of MetLife Premier Client Group. In regards to our unit cost initiative or UCI, our first half expense savings are generally in line with expectations. Consistent with prior guidance, as provided at our 2016 Investor Day, we believe full year 2017 UCI expense savings will be masked by the impacts of our onetime investments in stranded overhead with the net unfavorable impact to operating expenses of approximately $100 million. Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $203 million, up 10% and 9% adjusting for notable items in the prior year quarter. The primary drivers are strong non-medical health underwriting and volume growth. Group Benefits operating PFOs were $4.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year, driven by growth across all markets. PFO growth was negatively impacted by the loss of a large dental contract in this quarter. Excluding this impact, PFO growth was 5% and at the high end of our guidance of 3% to 5%. Group Benefits sales were up 30% year-to-date with growth across all products. We continue to see particular strength in the jumbo market due to more quote activity and higher closing ratios, while persistency continued to be favorable. Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, reported operating earnings of $268 million, up 3% due to reserve adjustment in the prior year quarter. Excluding all notable items, operating earnings were down 5% due to lower investment margins driven by continued spread compression. RIS operating PFOs were $1.2 billion, driven by two large pension risk transfers sales. Excluding PRT, PFOs were down 1% year-over-year. We continue to see a good PRT pipeline and expect 2017 to be an active year for transactions of all sizes. Our approach will continue to balance growth with an efficient use of capital. Property & Casualty or P&C, operating earnings were $28 million, up $30 million compared to the second quarter of 2016, and up $15 million after adjusting for notable items in the prior year quarter. This result was due to improved auto underwriting, particularly offset -- partially offset by non-catastrophe weather losses in homeowners. Our P&C combined ratio excluding cats and prior year development with 88.2% better than the prior year quarter of 90.8%. We continue to see improvement in our underwriting auto results, which posted a combined ratio excluding cats and prior year development of 94.2%, well below the 101.0% in the prior year quarter. Auto results have benefited from targeted rate increases over the last 12 months of 7% to 8%. And we expect to take similar rate actions in the immediate future. P&C operating PFOs were $887 million, up 1% year-over-year primarily the result of the auto rate increases. Overall, P&C sales were also up 1%, reflective of price increases and management actions to drive value. Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $310 million, up 20% but down 4% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. Volume growth was offset by higher expenses and less favorable underwriting. Asia operating PFOs were $2.0 billion, down 1%, but up 1% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were down 4% on a constant currency basis, reflecting management’s action to improve value in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 5% as the shift to foreign currency whole life continued. FX life sales were up 43%, while yen life sales were down 66%. FX life sales accounted for 85% of total life sales in Japan this quarter. A&H sales in Japan were down 9% in advance of the introduction of our refreshed medical products Flexi S and Flexi Gold S, which were launched in July, which we expect will have improved sales in the second half of the year. Emerging market sales in Asia were up 21%, driven by continued growth in China, following the successful launch of the whole new life critical illness product called Safeguarding Your Health, which is the first in the market to offer our full end-to-end health solution. Latin America reported operating earnings of $154 million, up 12% and 14% on a constant currency basis, the key drivers were volume growth, lower taxes and higher investment margins. We expect lower operating earnings in the second half of the year as the full impact of the Provida fee reduction implemented in June takes hold and the favorable market performance in the first half returns to normal. Latin America operating PFOs were $928 million, up 2% on both the reported and constant currency basis. This growth reflects the non-renewal of a low margin large group contract in the second quarter of 2017. Excluding this non-renewal, PFOs were up 8% driven by strong growth in Mexico. Total sales for the region were down 28% on a constant currency basis due to large employee benefit sale in Mexico in the prior year quarter. Excluding this employee benefit sale, sales were up 3%. EMEA operating earnings were $72 million, up 13% and 24% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were favorable expense margins and underwriting. EMEA operating PFOs were $625 million, down 1% but 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Turkey and employee benefits in the UK. Total EMEA sales decreased 5% on a constant currency basis, mainly due to competitive pressures in the Gulf as well as the recently exited Wealth Management business in the UK. As a reminder, we had guided to flat EMEA sales in 2017, mainly due to uncertainty in the UK, following Brexit. Those challenges mainly related to low interest rates have proven to be server. While the Gulf has been a challenge, we continue to see strong growth in other parts of the Middle East, particularly Turkey and Egypt, and also in A&H business across the region, which now represents nearly a quarter of overall EMEA sales. MetLife Holdings reported operating earnings of $235 million, compared to $33 million operating loss in the second quarter of 2016. The second quarter of 2016 operating loss was due to a $304 million negative impact, primarily from the separation related items and other insurance adjustments. Operating earnings in the second quarter of 2017 include a $40 million negative impact from separation related activities that was offset in Brighthouse Financial. Excluding notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 1%, driven by favorable equity market impact and underwriting, mostly offset by lower investment margins. MetLife Holdings operating PFOs were $1.4 billion, down 17%, mostly due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group, which included the Company’s affiliated broker dealer unit. As previously guided, we expect operating PFOs to decline by approximately 12% in 2017 versus 2016. Corporate & Other reported an operating loss of $146 million compared to an operating loss of $243 million in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, the operating loss was $115 million compared to loss of $244 million in the prior year quarter, driven by a lower effective tax rate and favorable investment margins. As for the Company’s effective tax rate, it was 20.6% and 21.7% after adjusting for favorable tax audit in the quarter. We still expect the Company’s 2017 effective tax rate to be between 21% and 22%, as previously guided. The primary reason for the company’s low tax rate has been due to the tax preference items in the U.S. and foreign operations tax at lower rates in the U.S. tax rate of 35%. Brighthouse Financial operating earnings were $283 million, down 5% or 31% after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The decline in earnings when adjusted for notable items was primarily driven by lower net investment income from reduced interest rate, swap and securities lending books, lower universal life for secondary guarantees earnings after the model changes in the second quarter of 2016 and higher expenses. The higher expense activity is related to the build-out of Brighthouse as a standalone basis. As a standalone company, Brighthouse Financial expects corporate expenses to be $175 million to $225 million higher in initial year, post-separation as compared to the 2015 levels, as well as incremental interest expense from debt service. Overall annuity sales were down 8%, and life sales were down 64%, mostly resulting from the sale of the MetLife Premier Client Group, in July of 2016. Sales of the Company’s index-linked annuity product, Shield Level Selector, remained strong. In the second quarter of 2017, sales were $570 million, up 28% year-over-year and over $1 billion for the first half of 2017. As a reminder, Brighthouse Financial segment results within MetLife’s financial statements do not match the financial statements of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and related companies shown in the most recent Brighthouse Financial Form 10, due to accounting timing differences. Next, I would like to comment on some of the expected third quarter financial impacts, as a result of the Brighthouse Financial separation. The separation will result in Brighthouse’s historical results being reported as discontinued operations. Upon separation, the remaining ownership interest in Brighthouse Financial will be accounted for under the equity method with changes in the fair value reported in net investment gains and losses. To give you an indication, if Brighthouse Financial closes at $70 per share at the end of the third quarter, we would anticipate realized losses of approximately $120 million post-tax. In addition, there are $800 million of losses post-tax related to intercompany transactions and tax-related items. Additionally, we anticipate an operating tax charge of approximately $200 million related to the repatriation of cash as a result of the separation, partially offset by a tax benefit associated with dividend from our foreign operations. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.6 billion at June 30th, which is up from $3.8 billion at March 31st. This increase reflects $615 million of net proceeds from the spin, as well as subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our quarterly common dividend, and other holding company expenses. As announced in the MetLife and Brighthouse Financial Form 8-Ks filed last night, MetLife will receive a cash remittance of approximately $1.8 billion from Brighthouse Financial prior to the completion of the spin-off. This brings MetLife’s total net cash remittance to $3.0 billion. Of the remaining $1.2 billion, $295 million was received in the fourth quarter 2016, $640 million received this quarter, the remaining relates to proceeds received from unwinding of certain reinsurance transactions, which we recognize at the holding company in 2018. This is lower than our initially planned range of $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion to adjust for Brighthouse Financial’s planned reserve increases for refinements in legacy actuarial models. These refinements bring to a close an extensive internal and external review. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies including Brighthouse, preliminary year-to-date second quarter statutory operating earnings is approximately $1.8 billion, up 67% and preliminary net income is $538 million up 6%. MetLife’s U.S. companies excluding Brighthouse preliminary statutory operating earnings were $1.9 billion, up 67% and preliminary net income was $1.4 billion, up 83%. Both are higher primarily due to favorable underwriting and lower expenses, partially offset by lower net investment income. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $26 billion as of June 30th, up 6%. MetLife’s preliminary statutory adjusted capital was $20 billion, up 3% from December 31st, 2016 primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by dividend paid to the holding company. Brighthouse Financial expects, combined statutory total adjusted capital to be approximately $6.4 billion as of June 30th, an increase of $2.2 billion from March 31st. This increase was driven primarily by spin-off related transaction at the life holding companies including a $600 million capital contribution to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company on June 30th and proceeds to the Brighthouse bond offering. Brighthouse Financial estimates that at June 30th, variable annuity assets above CTE95 would be approximately $2.3 billion pro forma for the separation. For MetLife Japan, the solvency margin ratio was 957% as of March 31st which is laid as public data. Overall, MetLife had a strong second quarter in 2017, highlighted by favorable impacts in equity markets and solid underwriting in the U.S. as well as a continued focus on expense management. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong and we remain confident that the actions we’re taking to implement our strategy will drive free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders. And with that, I’ll turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sean Dargan: Yes. Thank you and good morning. I have a question about the corporate segment. Results have been more favorable than I think were in most models, in the first and second quarters. How should we think about the timing of the expense initiatives? And just wondering if you can give any guidance for how corporate is going to play out the rest of the year?
John Hele: Hi, this is John. So, corporate does have volatility in tax from quarter to quarter. We assume it’s [ph] onetime tax settlements that would be reflected in there that’s why it’s a bit lower this quarter, as well as timing. And as I said in my comments, issues of tax rate for the full year between 21% and 22%, I think that will be a model on track.
Sean Dargan: And then, a question about the competitive environment in group. We’ve seen at least four to five carriers, all have very favorable risk results. Is this as good as it’s going to get and is this the point where competitive pressures lead to some carriers starting cutting pressing?
Michel Khalaf: Hi, Sean. This is Michel. So, we’re seeing -- the environment is competitive and life and disability, it’s aggressive on the dental font. We remain disciplined in terms of our approach. And as you can see from our sales in the first half of the year, we have good growth across all segments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: John, the final adjustments that you highlight that are coming for the Brighthouse spend, can you just go through those again? Will all those hit GAAP net income, be [ph] OCI adjustments instead, and how many of those will actually have an impact on capital at RemainCo or will they largely be non-cash?
John Hele: So, these generally all flow through net income. And most adjustments I’ve spoken about are non-cash items.
Tom Gallagher: And could you total those up again, I had trouble keeping track of those?
John Hele: Yes. Let me just flip to my page. So, as we announced in the 8-K, we expect $1.8 billion, which will come in today in cash from Brighthouse to MetLife holding companies. It brings the total to $3 billion, 3.0; of the remaining 1.2, 295 we got in fourth quarter 2016...
Tom Gallagher: No. John, sorry to interrupt you. I meant the charges that are coming in 3Q, not the cash payments.
John Hele: Okay. So, we first -- the first charge will be in the third quarter, will be reflecting the mark-to-market on our remaining shareholding in Brighthouse Financial. So, to give you a reference point of that that will get marked at the end of the quarter; it flow through net income. If Brighthouse closed at $70 a share, that’d be $120 million post-tax, and delta $5 difference in that number would be about $75 million delta.
Tom Gallagher: Okay.
John Hele: If -- there will be another $800 million of losses post-tax, these are intercompany transaction and tax related items. The vast majority of those would be non-current cash impact, some are accounting adjustments. And the tax charges were not in the current taxpaying position. So, they would not be for the foreseeable future for at least the next five years impacting our cash position. I also mentioned that we anticipate an operating tax charge, approximately $200 million related to the repatriation of cash, as a result of separation, partially offset by tax benefit associated with dividends from our foreign operations. As part of the separation, we are bringing back -- we anticipate to bring back approximately $3 billion of foreign cash, so that generates the tax charge, but we’ll get $3 billion cash back from the foreign holding companies to the U.S. and that’s -- and we can do that in this quarter, related to the separation. We’re still evaluating and considering this point, but we wanted to give you a heads up on that. This will not change our [indiscernible] 23 election going forward.
Tom Gallagher: And then, Steve, just for a point of clarification, did you start up by saying you’re targeting $800 million of after tax expense saves by 2020? I thought previously you said pretax.
Steve Kandarian: Pretax.
Tom Gallagher: Sorry, I thought you said after tax in your prepared remarks. So, it’s still pretax?
Steve Kandarian: It is.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Hi, thank you. I was just hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on what’s driving the needs of the increased statutory reserves at Brighthouse, which block of business it relates to and why it’s coming up now?
John Hele: Absolutely. So, first of all, this reserve charge that’s mentioned in the Brighthouse 8-K, it’s only statutory, there is no impact on GAAP on this and there is no impact to the rest of MetLife and all this, this is only a Brighthouse view. As you have seen by reading to the Form 10, it’s been very extensive modeling on the variable annuity business. This charge does -- this reserve increase does reflect -- it is in the variable annuity business. We have had underway, in addition to all this modeling, a very extensive internal and external model review going on. And this is the end result to close out the final items of that. And we expect this reserve adjustment for the refinements will be a prior period adjustment and will be part of the second quarter statutory filing.
Erik Bass: Got it. And I’d assume that this changes some of the sensitivities in other tables that are outlined in the Form 10. Do you have a plan or does Brighthouse have a plan to update those?
John Hele: No, this will not. Brighthouse will be in the exact same position because the smaller dividend coming up to us offsets that whole need. So, their current Form 10 is fully effective and all the numbers are fully applicable. And I want to reiterate that going forward, this dividend up from Brighthouse, none of this is in our free cash flow guidance that we’ve given between 65% to 75% between 2017 and 2018; this is all in addition to that cash flow that we have. And we expect to still be in a very strong cash position and the fact that this is lower than what we had anticipated when we first started this project over a year ago is -- doesn’t affect our current share buyback plans at all.
Erik Bass: Got it. And maybe last question sort of related to that. You mentioned bringing back the additional cash as well from the foreign subsidiaries. I guess, how do you bring up kind of total excess capital resources at the holding company and way sort of uses between -- obviously you are committed to maintaining the dividend and some delevering, but thinking about buybacks versus M&A or other uses with that excess capital.
John Hele: Well, our guidance for MetLife RemainCo is between $3 billion to $4 billion; we want to run with cash the holding companies. We’re in a very strong cash position post all of these elements and all of these elements and continue to expect to pay a very strong dividend going forward. As Steve has always said, we believe any excess over our target that we need belongs to the shareholders or will be used for valuable, accretive and good acquisitions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Nadel: I have a couple of questions. So, I have, I guess a bit of theoretical question for you, Steve or John. Why not -- as part of separation of Brighthouse, why not take them all the way to the $3 billion cushion above the CTE95 level, let them return less capital to you guys and see that stock come out of the box with the capital management story that I assume would greatly, positively affect the valuation relative to where it stands right now?
Steve Kandarian: John, we work closely with our bankers in terms of trying to find the sweet spot, in terms of how much capital would be in Brighthouse, post-separation. And some of the factors included making sure that there was adequate capital for Brighthouse to operate over the long run. But, just the same as MetLife, not excess capital, that’s not needed to run the business appropriately, given the hedging strategy going forward, given the business model that they have put together with respect to new business being written and so on. So, there was a lot of discussion, a lot of analysis around where that right number would follow, and that’s what we came up with.
John Nadel: And then, John, I guess a question, inclusive of a few of these charges related to separation that we’ll see in the third quarter. For RemainCo, can you give us a sense for making all of these adjustments? What is your estimate of what the book value per share ex-AOCI and ex-FCTAs will be? And I’m coming up with something around $40 to $42 a share, is that reasonable?
John Hele: We’ll have more details releasing that next week once the distribution is finalized and the pieces exactly are figured out. So, we’ll have some better information early next week coming out to you on that John.
John Nadel: And I’ve got one more if I could sneak it in. Just the $0.09 that you mentioned of year-over-year pressure from lower core investment spreads, how much of that was RemainCo versus Brighthouse and how should we think about that sensitivity for RemainCo after the separation?
John Hele: It’s actually in both. I don’t have the exact split on my fingertips here. But, I’d assume it’s pretty proportional. All of our portfolios are seeing some spread compression year-after-year as the portfolio runs off. And I think it’s about half, yes, it’s about half, half and half between Brighthouse and the RemainCo in terms of the split. So, going forward, if rates don’t come up more, we will continue to see some pressure here. It’s why we’re taking cost out of the company, so that we can react to it and manage the company well going forward.
John Nadel: Okay. But all else equal, we can think about $0.04, maybe $0.05 a share on a year-over-year basis assuming rates don’t move?
John Hele: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Seth Weiss: Yes, hi. Thank you. I just want to follow up on Corporate and may be just ask the question explicitly as it relates to guidance. Should we still assume that that $450 to $650 million loss in Corporate excluding the expense initiatives is a good guidance number for the full year? And then relatively, should we assume that $300 million of expense initiatives is also a good run rate for the full year, as you guided to in your outlook call?
John Hele: So, the range, 450 to 650 was excluding the expense initiatives, Seth. And right now, we’d be toward the lower end of that range. And yes, we’re still within our UCI guidance, generally.
Seth Weiss: Okay. And on Brighthouse, could you give any detail on how much the higher expense build was in the quarter there?
John Hele: Seth, let me just check on that and I can get back to you in a second.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR. Please go ahead.
Randy Binner: Good morning. Couple of quick follow-ups, first just to John Nadel’s question. What exactly will be the timing and format of the restated numbers, post-spin?
John Hele: Let me answer the question that Seth had. It was a $15 million pretax, was a higher cost in the quarter from BHF. And we will have more guidance for you early next week. Once the spin is complete, we will have more information coming out for you on that.
Randy Binner: Okay. And then, I guess just jumping to pension closeouts, this is a little bit longer term question, but the activity there was good in the second quarter. Does your attitude or positioning either strategically or from a financial perspective change, now that Brighthouse is going to be spun out? Does that give you more risk tolerance to do more in the pension closeout area?
John Hele: As we’ve mentioned when we talk about pension closeouts, we think this is a good growing business, but we actually have annual capital budget. We think on how to allocate to that business, and the spin-off of Brighthouse doesn’t really affect how we think about that. So, we like the business, but we only put a certain percentage of our capital to that each and every year.
Randy Binner: Is that something that would be subject to review or is that kind of the final capital budget there?
John Hele: I think it’s pretty much where we’re. And of course, we look at it every year and we think about the opportunities and the margins available in that business versus other margins and other activities. We think we have a good balance today in how we do that business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Lee: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. On the third-party asset management side, you mentioned you want to grow it organically and maybe through M&A. Is there any area from a product perspective or geographic perspective that you’re interested in taking a step at potential M&A?
Steve Goulart: Hi Humphrey, it’s Steve Goulart. I think as we’ve defined the strategy that we’re pursuing in third-party asset management, it’s pretty clear, we’re drawing on our core capabilities and strength. And that really means emphasizing institutional fixed income and real estate asset classes. And so, that’s what we’ve been doing so far. We’ve grown the business very well on an organic basis, and we’ve been looking opportunistically on ways to grow through acquisitions, and that’s of course how we resulted in the acquisition of Logan Circle Partners. But again, it really is focused on fixed income assets for institutional clients and real estate. We think that’s what core strengths off for now.
Humphrey Lee: So, given you’re managing sizeable [indiscernible] for yourself to beginning with. So, looking at potential acquisitions, would you be taking more of bolt-on type, because you don’t necessarily need to scale or do you guys just have a stronger appetite?
John Hele: As we look at acquisitions, they really are three criteria that we look out. One is it has to meet our financial criteria, and Steve talked about that too. We’re very discipline financially. So, anything we look at, has to make sense from that perspective. Second, it goes to the strategy and I’ve outline the strategy. So, it really is in institutional fixed income and real estate. And so, when we look at those, they tend to be things that go along well with what we’re already doing, because we do want to try and achieve synergies on the revenue side, they’re usually going to be some expense synergies. But we want to be able to grow the business synergistically as well. And then third is it has to fit culturally too. And we want to integrate this business, we don’t believe that it should be run separately or businesses should be left outside of what we’re trying to do in MetLife Investment Management. So, someone that meets those criteria which I think are high bars, that’s what we’re looking for.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Just on the Brighthouse mark that you talked about for the third quarter, is that going to be a quarterly event then, as long as you own these shares?
John Hele: Yes. It would be mark-to-market through net income each and every quarter as long as we own the shares. But, as Steve said, we are not trying to be long-term holders of these shares.
Suneet Kamath: And then that $3 billion of cash that’s coming back to the U.S. that you talked about earlier. Was that contemplated in your free cash flow guidance for 2017 or is that incremental?
John Hele: It is already for cash flow, it’s cash at the holding companies, you have a U.S. holding company and a foreign holding company. But, due to separation, we anticipate and we believe that this part could be brought back to the U.S.
Suneet Kamath: And just relatively, why would the separation in U.S. business impact some cash that’s sitting outside U.S.?
John Hele: It’s a total capital across the board, and the tax court does allow for such a repatriation with significant separation activities.
Suneet Kamath: So, just to be clear, was that number in your holding company cash and so holding company cash I think includes U.S. HoldCo and international HoldCo? I’m just trying to figure out this is…
John Hele: Yes. That is correct.
Operator: And I’d now like to turn the call back to John Hall for closing comments.
John Hall: Great. Thanks everyone for joining us. And we’ll speak again next quarter. Thank you.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results in the business and the products of the Company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the risks factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall: Thank you, Greg and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's first quarter 2017 earnings call. On this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of MetLife.com in our earnings release and on our quarterly financial supplement. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because of MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and that derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of Senior Management. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Kandarian: Thank you, John and good morning everyone. Last night, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.41up from a $1.20 per share a year ago. Overall it was a strong quarter across most business segments with favorable results from a variable investment income, expense management and underwriting. Equity markets which rose by 5.5% in the quarter as measured by the S&P 500 create a tailwind for earnings. Well, low interest rates in a strong U.S. dollar remain as headwinds. Adjusting for notable items operating earnings were $1.46 per share, which compares to $1.31 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. Net notable items of $0.05 per share in the quarter including higher catastrophe losses, expenses to support our unit cost initiative, illegal settlement and a Penn Treaty guarantee fund assessment. These are offset in part by a retail life insurance reserve release. As noted in my annual letter to shareholders. MetLife has a leading position in group benefits with a market share of 25% among the large employers. We are also experiencing strong growth in the mid-market and have over 40,000 small employer relationships. What we pioneered this business as century ago, we consider group benefits an avenue for future growth and highlighted the segment as one of our growth engines and our November Investor Day. During the quarter sales of Group Benefits were up by 29% with strength across all market segments and product lines. Our national accounts sales were particularly strong especially among clients with more than 25,000 employees. We continue to invest in this business to create differentiated customer experiences, supported by strong enabling technology and leading data protection capabilities. Over the years our group customers have put their confidence in us, because of our financial strength and strong service capabilities. Today they're also trusting us to protect claim privacy in an uncertain world. The macroeconomic environment in the last eight years has affected our business units in different ways. Our group for example, is correlated to the health of the U.S. employment market. We have been able to grow premiums and fees in the group business at a compound annual rate to 4.5% over the past five years. Despite modest U.S. labor force and wage growth among large employers, all else being equal a stronger U.S. job market would drive faster growth in our Group Benefits business. I have also made note of our shift away from capital intensive [indiscernible] Life Insurance in Japan. This decision was driven by our requirement for appropriate internal rates of return and payback periods for the products we sell. The shift in our product mix resulted in lower Japanese sales for most in 2016, but we have started to turn the corner, in the first quarter 2017, Japan sales grew by 8% which strengthened foreign currency denominated whole life as well as accident & health products. Although this is too early to declare a trend from a single quarter, we are pleased with the overall direction or sales transition in Japan. MetLife's net derivative losses in the quarter totaled $602 million. With interest rates ending in the first quarter of roughly where they started, much of the derivatives loss were driven by strength in the U.S. equity markets and costs associated with executing the separation of Brighthouse Financial. As part of a supplemental disclosure we've again included an exhibit that details that firm value movement of our derivative portfolio. As promised at meetings with investors throughout the first quarter, we are providing on this call an update on RemainCo MetLife hedging strategy. We refreshed our hedging strategy to protect free cash flow from both falling and rising interest rates. This was accomplished through a process that sought to optimize free cash flow, well balancing several key statutory economic and GAAP metrics. While the restructuring of the RemainCo hedge program is largely complete the program is dynamic. You actively monitor and rebound when market conditions warrant. John Hele offer more detail on this topic. Moving to investments, variable investment income totaled $343 million in the quarter, of this amount $272 million is attributable to RemainCo MetLife, which is above the high end of the quarterly guidance range of $250 million provided our outlook call in December, private equity investments for the largest contributor to the outperformance. In addition, hedge fund returns improved significantly from a year ago. In the quarter, our global new money yields stood at 3.34%, this comparison average rollout of 4.45% over the past four quarters. In the fourth quarter, our new money rate was 3.15%. Lower yields continued to pressure the life insurance industry. I would now like to provide an update on our plan to separate a substantial portion of our U.S. retail business. Maybe you have asked whether the separation of Brighthouse Financial will still occur in the first half of 2017. Given the complexity of the transaction we do not believe we have the necessary approvals to complete the separation in that timeframe. The MetLife and Brighthouse Financial teams continue to work diligently with our regulators in all aspects of the disaffiliation. While we did not have an exact estimate of when that work will be complete. We are hopeful it will be in the coming months. Operationally the separation is proceeding on schedule and we have reached several important milestones. In January, Brighthouse Financial began to operate as in Penn Treaty under MetLife. In March, most significantly Brighthouse Financial began doing business under its own name. In April, Brighthouse Financial launched its first broadcast advertising campaign called predictability. You may have seen some of the ads during March Madness, the Masters or on Squawk Box. And most recently, we finalized a form of financing for Brighthouse captive to hold you ULSG liabilities. This captive will aid Brighthouse's capital efficiency and reduce statutory capital volatility. Looking ahead, the next regulatory milestone will be the declaration of a hearing date by the Delaware Department of Insurance. We remain confident that the separation will position both companies for success in the respective marketplaces. For MetLife the separation remains the cornerstone of our transformation to a company with lower market sensitivity in a higher and more sustainable free cash flow ratio. Turning to regulatory matters, I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal of the court ruling that rescinded our status as a Systemically Important Financial Institution or SIFI. On April 21st the Trump Administration issued a memorandum directing the Secretary of the Treasury to report within 180 days of the SIFI designation process used by the Financial Stability Oversight Council or FSOC. On April 24th MetLife filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, asking the court to hold the appeal in abeyance until that report is complete. As we said in our filing, we believe in abeyance will enable the new administration to determine whether any of FSOC's positions in this case should be reconsidered and whether it is appropriate for the government to continue pressing the appeal. The timing for a ruling on our emotion is at the discretion of the Court of Appeals. Before I close, I want to update you on our share repurchase program. During the first quarter, we repurchased $858 million of our common shares. To date, we have bought back approximately $1.5 billion of our common shares, well roughly half of our $3 billion authorization that we announced in November 2016. We are on track to fully execute this authorization by year end 2017. With that I will turn the call over John to discuss our Q1 financial results in greater detail.
John Hele: Thank you, Steve and good morning. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results including a discussion of our insurance underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. In addition to our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, last evening we released disclosure labeled 1Q 2017 supplemental slides. That addresses the net derivative loss in the quarter. I will speak to these slides later my presentation. We will continue to release additional supplemental slides when we have complex elements in a quarter. Operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.5 billion or a $1.41 share. This quarter included five notable items totaling the negative $61 million that we highlighted in our news release and quarterly financial supplement. First, unfavorable catastrophe experience net of prior year development in Property & Casualty, decreased operating earnings by $45 million, or $0.04 per share, after tax. Second, Corporate & Other was negatively impacted by a guaranty fund assessment for the Penn Treaty insolvency and an increase in litigation reserves, which decreased operating earnings by $44 million, or $0.04 per share, after tax. Third, expenses related to a cost initiative also in Corporate & Other decreased operating earnings by $21 million, or $0.02 per share, after tax. Fourth, reserve adjustments primarily resulting from modeling improvements of individual life products, which increased operating earnings in MetLife Holdings by $34 million or $0.3 per share after tax. In addition, activity related to separation resulted in an increase to operating earnings of $42 million in MetLife Holdings and offsetting $42 million decrease to operating earnings in Brighthouse Financial. Finally, variable investment income was above the company's 2017 quarterly business plan range excluding Brighthouse Financial, increased in operating earnings by $15 million, or $0.01 per share, after tax, and the impact of deferred acquisition costs or DAC. Adjusted for all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 11% year-over-year and 12% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis operating earnings adjusted for all notable items or $1.46 up 11% percent year-over-year and 12% on a constant currency basis. Turning to our bottom line results. We had first quarter net income of $820 million or $0.75 per share. Net income was $726 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of net derivative losses of $602 million after tax. For more details about the difference between net income and operator earnings please reference Page 3 in our supplemental slide disclosure this quarter. Page 4 in the supplemental slides shows the attribution of the after tax derivative loss. As Steve noted, the derivative losses driven by strength in the U.S. equity market and the repositioning of our hedging strategies. For the total company, the $602 million GAAP derivative net loss included, number one, $402 million or two thirds of the total for asymmetrical and non-economic accounting, which including cost to reposition to remain co-hedges to protect from changes in interest rates on a statutory basis. Number two, $139 million of VA hedge ineffectiveness primarily in Brighthouse Financial including the impact of the transition to their new hedging strategy, with number three, the balance of $61 million largely driven by other risks in VA embedded derivatives. The asymmetrical non-economic accounting it's a recurring feature under U.S. GAAP, as the derivative assets and mark-to-market, but a significant portion of MetLife's VA and life liabilities are not. As Steve mentioned, we've made significant progress at RemainCo with protecting our statutory capital and thus free cash flow from future changes in interest rates. We have obtained further hedge accounting treatment on a statutory basis and restructured the hedges such that our free cash flow percentage is expected to stay within a 65% to 75% band on average over two years with a range of the 10 year Treasury rate from 1.5% to 4%. As stated in the recently filed Form 10 Amendment, Brighthouse Financial has made significant progress in repositioning to its new strategy. This strategy targets hedging to the statutory measurement of CTE (95) while also holding a targeted buffer of $2 billion to $3 billion. The new hedges protect on the downside using a portion of buffer, but on the upside potential of the Brighthouse Financial. Brighthouse Financial believes this new strategy will reduce hedging cost overtime and improve statutory results. Brighthouse Financial and MetLife share a common philosophy of preserving free cash flow to the hedging strategies and protecting statutory capital. But the circumstances of the companies are bit different. Brighthouse Financial is hedging to CTE(95), Brighthouse Financial has a greater concentration of variable annuity business than RemainCo and this capital measured better reflects Brighthouse Financial's business. This Brighthouse Financial maintains a large capital buffering it can retain some risk like a deductible reducing hedge costs. In contrast RemainCo has a more diverse business with a lower concentration in variable annuities and no longer rights new variable annuity business in the U.S. Book value per share excluding AOCI other FCTA with $50.52 as of March 31st down 5% year-over-year primarily due to the impact of derivative losses as well as the actual assumption review in the second quarter of 2016. Tangible book value per share was $41.64 of March 31st down 6% year-over-year. With respect to first quarter underwriting margins, total company earnings were lower by approximately $0.13 per share versus the prior quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting in Brighthouse Financial accounted for approximately $0.10 of the total decrease. This is primarily due to the previously disclosed impact from the loss of the aggregation benefit, in variable in universal life and the second quarter 2016 modeling changes. Excluding Brighthouse Financial underwriting earnings were lower by proximately $0.03 per share year-over-year. This is primarily due to higher claim volumes in Mexico and the impact of DAC assumption change in the company's Chile pension business, as well as a one-time reserve adjustment in Japan. In the U.S. underwriting results were essentially in line with the prior year quarter. The Group life mortality ratio was 86.9%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 85.7%, but below the midpoint of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. This is the second lowest, first quarter mortality ratio for Group life in 13 years only the first quarter of 2016 was lower. MetLife Holdings interest adjusted benefit ratio for life products was $48.6% and $53.8% after adjusting for notable items discussed earlier. This result was favorable to the prior year quarter of 56.6% and in the low end of the targeted range of 53% to 58%. Finally the Group nonmedical health interest adjusted benefit ratio was 79.9% favorable to the prior-year quarter of 81.2% and within the 2017 annual target range of 76% to 81%. Favorable underwriting results were primarily due to renewal actions and dental and lower new claims severity and disability. Turning to investment margins, the weighted average of the three products spreads presented in our QFS was 165 basis points in the quarter, up 25 basis points year-over-year. Pre-tax variable investment income or VII, was $343 million, up $178 million versus the prior year quarter, driven by strong private equity and hedge fund performance. Product spreads excluding VII were 129 basis points this quarter, down 2% year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. Overall, higher investment margins in the quarter accounted for approximately $0.01 of EPS improvement year-over-year. In regards to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 22.5% and 21.6% after adjusting for the notable items this quarter related to the Penn Treaty litigation reserves and the Company's unit cost initiative. The ratio was favorable to the prior year quarter of 23.8% primarily due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group and expense efficiencies. Overall, better expense margins contributed approximately $0.08 of EPS improvement versus the prior-year quarter. I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $174 million, up 37% and 34% adjustment for notable items in both quarters. The primary drivers were favorable expense margins and strong nonmedical health underwriting results. Group Benefits operating PFOs were $4.3 billion, up 5% year-over-year, driven by growth across all markets. This is the high end of our guidance of 3% to 5% which excluded the loss of one large dental contract which will occur in the second quarter. Group Benefits sales were up 29% with growth across all markets. We saw our particular strength in the jumbo case market due to more core activity and higher closing ratios, while persistency continues to be favorable. Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, reported operating earnings of $218 million, up 16% but down 1% after adjusting for notable items in the both quarters due to less favorable underwriting. RIS operating PFOs were $479 million, essentially unchanged year-over-year. While one 1Q tends to be the seasonally the weakest for PRT transactions we continue to see a good PRT pipeline and we expect 2017 to be an active year for transactions of all sizes. Our approach will continue to balance growth with an efficient use of capital. Property & Casualty or P&C, operating earnings were $29 million, up 32% but down 3% after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. Elevated catastrophes net of prior year development reduced operating earnings by $45 million in both quarters. Nearly half of these cats were due to hail storm activity in northern Texas. We have taken steps to address this. And as a result of our homeowner policy count in this area has declined 18% year-over-year. We expect the pace of decline will accelerate to additional rate increases and management actions. Our P&C combined ratio excluding cats and private development with 89.8% modestly better than the prior year quarter of 90.0%. We continue to see improvement in our non-cat auto results, which posted a combined ratio excluding cats in prior year development of 97.2%, well below the 100.7% in the prior year quarter. Lower auto claim frequency was partially offset by higher severity as repair costs continue to increase on technology-laden vehicles. We have been taking targeted rate increases in auto over the last 12 months of 7% to 8% and expect to take similar lead actions in the immediate future. P&C operating PFOs were $875 million, down 1% year-over-year. Overall P&C sales were down 5% to due to price increases and management actions to drive value. Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $295 million, down 3% from the prior year quarter and 4% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. Volume growth and lower expenses were offset by higher reserves and taxes due the change in the Japan effective tax rate. Asia operating PFOs were $2.1 billion, up 3% and up 1% on a constant currency basis. PFO's included in the joint ventures and ownership was up 3% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were up 35% on the constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were up 8% driven by foreign currency life and accident & health growth. Other Asia sales were up 89% representing good growth in all markets, during particularly by China with the growth of our protection business through our professional agency channel as well as a large group case in Australia. Latin America reported earnings of $143 million down 5% and down 8% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The key drivers are less favorable underwriting due to higher claims in Mexico and the impact of an assumption change in a company's Chile pension business. Favorable market impact due to better yields in Mexico and time as well as volume growth will partial offsets. Latin-America operating PFOs $916 million up 5% and 6% on a constant currency basis. Total sales for the region were up 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong employee benefit sales, particularly offset by lower pension sales in Mexico. EMEA operating earnings were $75 million, up 19% and 34% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were favorable expense margins and volume growth. While unit cost improvement is ahead of plan a meaningful portion of the year-over-year decline expenses is related to timing and favorable items that are not expected to repeat in subsequent quarters. EMEA operating PFOs were $614 million, essentially unchanged from the prior-year period on a 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Turkey as well as employee benefits in the UK and Egypt. Total EMEA sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see a favorable shift with higher margin products in the region. MetLife Holdings, which primarily consists of our legacy retail and long term care runoff businesses, reported operating earnings of $385 million, up 44% and 12% adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were improves underwriting and market results. MetLife Holdings operating PFOs were $1.5 billion, down 8% mostly due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group, which included the Company's affiliated broker dealer unit. As previously guided with operating PFOs declined by approximately 12% in 2017 versus 2016. Corporate & Other, at an operating loss of $99 million compared to an operating loss of $190 million in the first quarter 2016. Adjusting for notable items in the current period, the operating loss of $30 million, this unusually low quarterly loss for Corporate & Other is primarily due to the incremental tax benefit of $151 million reflected in the earnings by source table at the bottom of Page 28 in the QFS. The incremental tax benefit is acquired by GAAP accounting rules to adjust the Company's overall consolidated queerly tax rate to equal the Company's annual projected effective tax rate. As a result it enables the consolidated tax rate to be consistent period over a period it causes Corporate & Other to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. As with the Company's effective tax rate respected, we expected to be between 21% to 22% for 2017 down from 23% as previously guided, the primary reason is the benefit of non-U.S. operation rates lower than the U.S. tax rate of 35%. Brighthouse Financial operating earnings were $244 million down 25% and 17% of adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The key drivers of the earnings decline primarily related to the previously mentioned unfavorable, underwriting including $39 million a loss of the aggregation benefit and $10 million from the previously discussed 2Q 2016 modeling changes. As a reminder Brighthouse Financial same results within MetLife's financial statements do not match the financial statements of Brighthouse Financial Inc. and related companies shown in the most recent Brighthouse Financial Form 10 due to accounting timing differences. Brighthouse Financial PFO's were $1.1 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the first quarter 2016. Overall annuity sales are down 35% and life sales are down 54% mostly resulting from the suspension of sales through one distributor and lower sales in the MetLife Premier Client Group. Sales of the Company's index linked annuity product, Shield Level Selector remain strong in the first quarter 2017 at $455 million up 25% year-over-year. I will now discuss the cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $3.8 billion at March 31st which is down from $5.8 billion at December 31st. This decrease reflects the net effects of share repurchases, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses. Please note that first quarter cash at the holding companies include minimal dividends from our operating subsidiaries, and we expect operating subsidiary dividends to increase in the second quarter. Consistent with our prior guidance. We expect MetLife to receive between $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion in dividends from Brighthouse Financial prior to separation subject to regulatory approvals. Next I would like to provide you with an idea on our capital position. Our combined risk based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies excluding Alico was 465% on an ASC basis at year end 2016. For our U.S. companies preliminary first quarter statutory results were operating earnings of approximately $870 million and a net loss of $107 million. Statutory operating earnings were up 18% for the prior year quarter, primarily due to favorable underwriting and lower operating expenses. The net loss was primarily the result of losses underivatives. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $24.1 billion as of March 31st down 2% from $24.6 billion at December 31st. The decrease in statutory capital is driven by Brighthouse Financial with total adjusted capital or TAC reduced by $1.2 billion. This drop was a function of certain restructuring transaction to separation, which caused the reserves to be less responsive to equity markets in the quarter. Several restructuring and capitalization actions are expected to occur prior to the separation, which possibly impact in TAC. Many of these have been completed in the month of April. As a result, Brighthouse Financial combined TAC has increased by approximately $1.5 billion since quarter end. On a pro-forma basis as of March 31st 2017 and to give effect to our restructuring and separation related transactions including those in April, we continue to estimate a buffer of approximately $2.1 billion above CTE (95). This result in a combined pro forma RBC ratio for Brighthouse Financial of approximately 650% as of March 31 2017. Further details will be included in the next amendment to the Form 10, which we expect to file in May. For Japan, a solvency margin ratio was 909% as of December 31st, which is the latest public data. Overall MetLife had a strong first quarter in 2017. Highlighted by favorable impacts in equity markets, lower expenses and solid underwriting in the U.S. Top line growth was particularly strong with sales up 15% year-over-year for MetLife as a whole and 21% for MetLife on post-separation basis. GAAP net income was negatively impacted by net derivative losses, two thirds of which were asymmetrical and non-economic. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong, and we remain confident that the actions we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow, and driving at long term and create long term sustainable value to our shareholders. And with that I would turn it back to the operator for your question.
Q - Tom Gallagher: Good morning. Steve, just a question on the separation, you've mentioned the complexity that may delay the timing, just a question on that, do you still feel confident in the structure of the transaction, in terms of the dividends, the capital for each business or do you see the delay being more administrative complexity.
Steven Kandarian: Hi Tom, nothing changes in terms of our expectations other than the timing. In the timing I use the word months, I didn't use the word quarters. It is the complex transaction. We're working closely with our regulator. There's a lot of information to impart. We are working very diligently and providing information as fast as humanly possible. But it is a large volume of information and analysis that is going on. So that's what's resulted in the expected delay from what our initial thought was, which was made many months ago, over many quarters ago in terms of expectations around timing once you get into these transactions and you see the complexity associated with them. You see what occurs in terms of the amount of work that has to get done to make sure that everything is detailed appropriately and headlines appropriately.
Tom Gallagher: Okay. Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then just a question on expenses to make sure I have had my head wrapped around these. So John, if I'm understanding the flow of the strategic expenses for RemainCo that would imply you still have another $260 million to $270 million left for the balance of the year. That would come through operating and corporate? That was my first question on expenses. And then also on Brighthouse, I just wanted to get a sense for how much of the kind of annualized $200 million increase in expenses this year is embedded in the 1Q result?
John Hele: The answer to your first question is yes, that's why you expect for the year and could you say the second question again, I quite get that?
Tom Gallagher: Yeah in the Form 10 it indicates Brighthouse expenses you're expected to go up $200 million in 2017 versus 2016 levels, and I just want to understand how much of that planned increase is embedded in the 1Q number. Is any of that or is a small amount just you know some indication of how much is in the 1Q number?
John Hele: Probably about $30 million of that is in Q1.
Tom Gallagher: $30 million on an annualized basis?
John Hele: No $30 million in the quarter, it's…
Tom Gallagher: In the quarter building to like $50 million quarterly run rate?
John Hele: Yeah, yeah.
Tom Gallagher: Okay, so little more than half. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Hi thanks. Good morning. My first question was in regard to the changes you made to the derivatives program. Should we expect any impact to the to your ongoing benefit from some of the low interest rate hedges that would come through that would have been coming through operating earnings?
Steven Kandarian: There's not a material change to the benefit that we get from those hedges, of course rates are higher now so we get less benefit, but those are still essentially there.
Ryan Krueger: Okay. So no material change, other than the interest rates are moving. And then just secondly, coming into the year you had guided to $450 million to $650 million of corporate losses excluding the expense initiative costs. Does that change now that you lowered your consolidated tax rate outlook?
John Hele: Yeah, so we expect still to be within that range, but we do expect the lower tax rate for the year now.
Ryan Krueger: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi good morning. First, I just had a question on the derivatives losses. Obviously the derivatives loss declined significantly from 4Q, but was still relatively large. So I was a little surprised with the loss in interest rates and that rates were generally flat or lowered depending on which part of the curve you look at. So just wondering what caused that was that related to sales some of that depreciations or something else. And then how the GAAP loss in on the hedging program affected yours whether it had any effect on stat capital?
Steven Kandarian: So there's a few things going on Jimmy. First is although the 1-year Treasury dropped a little or almost flat quarter-to-quarter swap rates were up a little bit. So some noise from that that's asymmetrical on non-economic, but you get the GAAP noise from that, and you also had some strong equity market in the quarter and you've got some GAAP noise in that as well. We also as we pointed out had some hedge ineffectiveness in the quarter and that impacted the total GAAP net income.
Jimmy Bhullar: And then just in terms of the change is implemented I'm assuming you change from swaps to swaps and as you had discussed before, but is that correct and how if you can discuss some of the other changes that you have made and whether you changed the size of the hedge program whether made it bigger or smaller?
Steven Kandarian: We actually did a variety of things. We were able to get some more statutory hedge accounting for some types of derivatives by changing their technique and structure. We did move from two different instruments like that. And we have accomplished our primary goal of making stat couple of RemainCo less sensitive to changes in interest rates. And as you can see from the numbers and the breakouts RemainCo has less sensitivity across the board in terms of equities it is relatively insensitive. I mean there's always movements and every time you look at these results every quarter there's a lot going on in a quarter when you have derivatives as well as variable annuities. There is the time decay of the derivatives is aging the portfolio your basis risk or otherwise is going to VA hedge ineffectiveness and all these get grouped together. So there are sensitivities going up and down we minimize that, but there always be some move movement here due to all these factors.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then lastly just you mentioned the strong sales in Asia and Japan. I think up to 8% to what extent do you view this as sort of a turn in their sales since the results had been pretty weak the last few quarters versus maybe some front selling related to the discount rate changes are going into effect in the second quarter?
Christopher Townsend: So let me touch, I'm Christopher Townsend here, so Japan sales were up 8% year-on-year and this driven primarily by cant see life sale growth were obliviously 1% as you know we made that shift from the end market volume for July the end of 2015, beginning of 2016, it's very strong growth in Asia is up 6%. So the foreign currency business now makes up about 70% of alternative life sales we think that fairly consistent at the mix going forward and as the number of our competitors have pulled the end life products and change pricing for the discount rate range. We think Asia is being pushed towards a foreign currency life products and we're very well positioned to provide that given the distribution we've got, so we see that as a fairly interesting team we probably did benefit from around [indiscernible] product we repriced in April, and as you know for the reserve discount price in the financial year and we expect sales with the full often in the second quarter. Overall we're very comfortable in terms of Japan sales, but it's too early to sort of break that guidance at the moment.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Hi. Thank you. In Group benefits can you just talk about the competitive environment and where you're seeing the best opportunities and given relatively strong industry results in recent quarters you've seen any uptick in price competition?
Maria Morris: Hi this is Maria Morris. First of all I just want to say we were very pleased with our group sales results in 2017. It's a competitive market as you know it's always competitive. But having said that, I'd say that life and disability has been rational. We've seen a little bit more of intense competition in dental, especially down market, but overall we feel very comfortable with the market that we are in. You probably saw that we had strong growth and strong persistency. We've been able to get our renewal actions. And overall it's been a rational market.
Erik Bass: Got it. And then one thing to clarify just on the pace of buybacks, should we expect it to slow it all until you receive the dividend payment from Brighthouse and I'm assuming that $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion is contingent on the transaction being approved. And I guess also are there any restrictions to your being in the market around the time of the transaction?
Steven Kandarian: No we don't anticipate any change in the program that we put in place between our existing cash reserves and earnings. We believe we're on track for the program being completed by 2017.
Erik Bass: Got it. OK. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sean Dargan: Thank you. And just to follow up on Erik's question around the share repurchase. As I understand it there was kind of a bright line test that RBC couldn't fall below 400% and it sounds like whatever happened with hedge losses in the first quarter didn't bring you close to that. But is that 400% applied to the statutory entities related to RemainCo or are all of the current MetLife?
Steven Kandarian: Well RBC as measured once a year and so were half of long term projections that we always knew that there's a lot of pluses and minuses as you do this restructuring unwinding reinsurance transaction to see the pieces moving back and forth and the Brighthouse 10 of RBC we haven't done the debt infusion yet from that. So there's a lot of moving pieces here, and you have to look and if take that into account we're strongly capitalized across the board for all our businesses.
Sean Dargan: Okay. That would be great, thanks. And then just on MetLife Holdings the results were stronger on a normalized basis than I would have thought. I mean broadly speaking should we think that in quarters and where just you have - you see favorable equity market performance that MetLife Holdings will not run off as quickly, as you guided to?
Steven Kandarian: Whether it's a block of VAs in MetLife Holdings. And so for equity markets we had better fees on an ongoing basis, and that will continue to be one of the factors.
Sean Dargan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Nadel: Thank you, good morning. My question about the group insurance business, Steve, it's been a long time since and since I can remember you sort of starting off the conference call talking about or highlighting that business. Given your size and scale there particularly at the large case market is there anything beyond further economies of scale that you think you could gain from a large acquisition within that business line. And relatedly why do you think you're seeing more success particularly in the jumbo case market has competition declined there or have you just gotten a bit more aggressive.
Steven Kandarian: John the first part of your question, we always look at any opportunities out there in the marketplace. And the Group business is one of which we have a very favorable view going forward and it's been a strong part of our company for many decades. So if there's opportunities in the marketplace to make an accretive acquisition, we certainly be quite interested in looking at that. Maria you want to take the second part of the question?
Maria Morris: Sure in terms of where we've been investing in group insurance, I think we're seeing the benefits of our investment in our growth. So as an example, we've been investing in our voluntary benefit platform, and so we're seeing large groups as well as medium sized groups really gravitate toward carriers both for their core benefit programs and to offer voluntary benefits to their employees toward a carrier like MetLife where we're in a position to do that. We've talked historically about benefiting as an example from the exchanges where we're in some cases the only non-medical carrier on the health exchanges and I think going forward the other place we really put investments in our ability to ensure that employee records are secure. So a lot of work in our security platforms that's been very helpful at market as we've look to bring on new Group life and disability business as well.
John Nadel: So Maria is it fair to say that when you talk about really strong growth in sales at the jumbo case market that a good chunk of that is actually voluntary not employer paid?
Maria Morris: It's actually both. I would say that we've had a very strong sales quarter up and down the market. So double digit growth in the jumbo market, but we've had high single digit growth in the regional market. And as you know smart market is actually not seasonally first quarter focused, but even there we've had strong growth. We've had growth in both our core business and our voluntary business, our voluntary business is up double digits from a sales perspective. So overall very strong sales quarter Group.
John Nadel: Thank you. And then a question for John, on the change in the hedging strategy implemented if both Brighthouse and RemainCo. Can you give us some senses to the duration of the program that you've put in place now and how often some of these hedges need to roll. I'm just trying to understand how the new instruments compare with some of the older hedges I'm not sure if you even still have them that had extended into the 2020s?
John Hele: So on RemainCo the duration is about the same and it's basically some longer term hedges mainly in that. Brighthouse is like a one to three year type restructuring of hedges that they're doing and they've made significant progress to get their hedging done now. So if you think about future sensitivities, we point out look at the Form 10 that was recently published. The sensitivity to VA as well as you ULSG in there and you can see both on a stat and a GAAP basis with expect to senses should be going forward.
John Nadel: No I understand that that disclosure is there, I was just trying to understand duration and you know maybe the risk of having to roll?
John Hele: So for balances is about one to three years.
John Nadel: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath up from Citi. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. Just want to start with the stat capital, I guess it was down about a $1 billion from year end despite not taking any dividends out. So John can you just walk the mechanics in terms of why the capital was down?
John Hele: Is going down $500 million from $24.6 million to $24.1 million, and as I said most of those Brighthouse Financial and they had some of the restructuring costs, less sensitivity to the reserves. The total of CTE (95) which is what they're really hedging to in their strategy, is still as a buffer when we take into account all the transactions that will happen so on a pro forma basis, but as of March 31st you are seeing partway through the restructuring and all the steps that have to happen. So you've seen that sort of the low point and is - as I said in my script it's up significantly from March 31st and there will be a whole series of further that have to happen to get there. So we gave you sort of the pro forma view of it and expect to be in like a 650 RBC pro forma for all that as of - if all that had happened as of March 31.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. And just another question on the update Form 10 to the changes or that the debt to capital of Brighthouse is now going to be 25% and then CTE (95) buffer has gone from I guess around $3 billion, to $2 billion to $3 billion so can you just discuss why - what drove those two changes?
John Hele: So the first Form 10 all the calculations the values as well as all the core assumptions and projections were all done as of June 30th last year. And the updated Form 10 as of December 31st and things change a lot between June 30th and December 31st. So there's a series of changes and I think Brighthouse will be a dynamic company and how they manage their business. And that's the reason for that still strongly capitalized and will provide good value over time to shareholders.
Suneet Kamath: Okay and just one last clarification question if could on the 9% ROE target for Brighthouse. Is that the guidance for sort of out of the gate or is that more of a longer term expectation?
John Hele: I think what happens with Brighthouse is for the next little while it is about that type of range, because of just how kind of GAAP works and there - their key focus is to build up overtime to reduce the hedging cost to start getting cash out of the company. And that's the key focus is to run it mainly on statutory basis.
Suneet Kamath: Okay, thanks.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Lee: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just to follow up on John does question regarding kind of the appetite for group market acquisition given your capital position like what like what size of the transaction would you be more comfortable doing it with kind of seeking external capital?
John Hele: Hi Humphrey. Well, first of all we certainly will have some capital in reserve for acquisitions, but please remember that we do acquisitions of larger size like the Travelers deal back in 2005 the Alico deal in 2010. We would access the capital markets for any funds necessary above and beyond we hold at the holding company. And it is just important to reiterate our philosophy on acquisitions they have to make sense strategically in terms of what we are planning for the company going forward direction in businesses we want to be in. And second of all they have to be creative for shareholders and create shareholder value have to earn more than their cost of capital. And any point in time when there is an acquisition opportunity we look at the capital markets, which of course is to raise capital in all kinds of returns would expect from acquisition including synergies and we make a determination in terms of what we're willing to pay for that business.
Humphrey Lee: Got it. And then just a housekeeping question, do you have any updates regarding the dividends to offer in some of your debt cost right now?
Steven Kandarian: Well, we do not believe that this will be a factor going forward. We have steps that we can take if we need to adjust for this. So that's something that we can plan for if we need to execute it.
Humphrey Lee: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And at this time there are no further questions. So I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Hall.
John Hall: Thank you everybody and we'll talk to you throughout the quarter. Good bye.

Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results in the business and the products of the Company and its subsidiaries.  MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the risks factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations. 
John Hall: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone and welcome to MetLife's fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. On this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures.  Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of MetLife.com in our earnings release and on our quarterly financial supplement. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because of MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and that derivative gains and losses which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.  Joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of Senior Management.  After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. 
Steve Kandarian: Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $1.28 and a net loss of $1.94. Capital market movements during the quarter, primarily the strong rise in interest rates, produced net losses in our derivative portfolio.  We own derivatives almost exclusively to protect against market fluctuations in interest rates, equities and currencies. An outsized post-election move in interest rates, characterized by the 85-basis point quarterly increase in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, affected the carrying value of our derivative portfolio to a greater degree than typical. Much of this is due to asymmetrical insurance accounting which marks assets, including derivatives, to fair value, while related insurance liabilities follow an accrual-based accounting model.  Despite almost all of our derivatives being used for hedging purposes, fewer than 15% qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the quarterly value of most of our derivatives flows through our income statement, while changes in the economically hedged risk do not.  As in past quarters, the vast majority of our after-tax net income impact, approximately 94% in the fourth quarter, represents asymmetrical and a non-economic movement that would reverse with a decline in interest rates. Despite these accounting-related volatility, rising interest rates remains favorable for MetLife over the longer term. Included in our disclosure for the quarter is a slide that offers more detail on the fair value movements of our derivative portfolio which a John Hele will discuss later in our presentation.  Adjusting for notable items in the quarter, operating earnings were $1.35 per share which compares to $1.33 per share on the same basis in the prior-year period. The only notable items in the quarter were $58 million of net insurance adjustments spread across the MetLife Holdings and Brighthouse segments and $28 million of spending incorporated in other, associated with the unit cost initiative we discussed at Investor Day.  Taking a closer look at operating earnings, we benefited from disciplined expense control, higher variable investment income and a lower tax rate. Offsetting these positives, were lower underwriting margins in our U.S. businesses and Brighthouse Financial.  Our full-year 2016 effective tax rate was 21.0%, modestly below the 22.1% estimate we provided on our third quarter call. In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 17.3%. The reversal of a tax item and the timing of tax credits account for much of the difference in the quarterly rate.  Our investment portfolio is starting to benefit from higher interest rates. Our new money rate rose from 2.89% in the third quarter to 3.15% in the fourth quarter. In absolute terms, recurring investment income was flat compared to a year ago, as higher asset balances served to offset the roll off of higher-yielding securities.  Variable investment income of $301 million came in just above the low end of our quarterly guidance range and was aided by another strong quarter of private equity returns. For the full year, VII totaled $1.16 billion, falling only modestly below our annual range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.  Looking back on 2016, MetLife took a number of actions that we believe will enable the Company to perform well in a variety of macroeconomic environments. The year began with the announcement of our plan to separate a substantial portion of our U.S. retail business. This decision to part with MetLife's original business dating back to 1868 was not made lightly and we're confident that the separation will allow both companies to achieve greater success, with each offering a unique value proposition to investors.  In March of 2016, MetLife achieved a significant regulatory victory when the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia rescinded our designation as a systemically important financial institution, with Judge Rosemary Collyer calling the process fatally flawed. When MetLife announced its intention to seek judicial review of FSOC's decision, few gave us any chance of success. We believe our decision to contest the designation contributed to FSOC reform, emerging as a key focus for policymakers.  After announcing our separation plan in January, we achieved a number of additional milestones throughout the year. We chose a name for the new Company, Brighthouse Financial; we appointed the Company's Senior Leadership Team; we completed the initial filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and we began the process of seeking various state regulatory approvals that will be required.  As you know, the separation of our U.S. retail business is central to a larger refresh of MetLife's enterprise strategy which is part of our accelerating value initiative. While strategy needs to continually adapt to the external environment, it is important to put stakes in the ground at key inflection points to show the direction the Company is taking. We did this in May of 2012 and again in November of 2016. We believe the course MetLife is following toward less capital-intensive and less market-sensitive businesses is both clear and correct.  As I said at Investor Day, capital is precious. Our enhanced capital budgeting process ensures that we prioritize businesses with high-risk-adjusted internal rates of return, lower capital intensity and maximum cash generation.  Another essential component of our refresh strategy is our commitment to operational excellence. From a cost perspective, this is driving a cultural shift at MetLife. Our expense targets are no longer absolute; rather, they are relative. If our revenues drop or our competitors become more efficient, our expense reduction targets will go up. The $1-billion target we announced in 2016 was a point-in-time estimate. It has already moved higher to ensure we can deliver $800 million in run rate savings to the bottom line by 2020, net of stranded overhead.  In conjunction with the rollout of our refresh strategy, we also launched our refresh brand. This was another pivotal decision that made 2016 one of the most transformative years in MetLife's history. Our new logo is modern, fresh and professional and our new tagline, Navigating life together, embodies the trusted partnership our corporate and individual customers across the globe tell us they want from MetLife.  MetLife closed out 2016 on a strong note with the announcement of a $3-billion share buyback program, the largest in our history. We're confident that our capital return plans will not face regulatory hurdles from the federal government. We repurchased $302 million in shares through the end of 2016 and remain an opportunistic buyer of our stock. Since year end, we've acquired another $283 million of our shares.  Looking ahead, we're encouraged the higher interest rates and the prospects for a more favorite regulatory environment, coupled with internal factors such as our new enterprise strategy, capital management and expense discipline, will position us for value creation for both our customers and shareholders.  I would like to end this morning by thanking MetLife's employees for their tremendous effort, dedication and focus over the past year. We're asking a great deal of them to ensure that MetLife's transformation is successful and I very much appreciate their hard work. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our Q4 and full-year 2016 financial results in greater detail. John? 
John Hele: Thank you, Steve and good morning. Today, I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of our insurance underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash on capital. Based on your feedback, we released additional disclosure last night labeled 4Q 2016 supplemental slides that addresses the large, more complex elements in the quarter, the large derivative loss and the fourth quarter tax rate. I will speak to these slides later in my presentation. In the future, we will release additional supplemental slides when we have complex elements in a quarter.  Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion, $1.28 per share. This quarter included a two notable items which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplements or QFS. First, changes in DAC associated with the annual fourth quarter approval of an increase in the dividend scale for traditional life insurance policies, primarily in MetLife Holdings, along with other insurance adjustments, decreased operating earnings by $58 million or $0.05 per share, after tax.  Second, severance expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased operating earnings by $28 million or $0.03 per share, after tax. Adjusted for all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 1% year over year. On a per-share basis, operating earnings adjusted for all notable items were $1.35, up 2% year over year.  Turning to our bottom-line results, we had a fourth quarter net loss of $2.1 billion or $1.94 per share. Net income was $3.5 billion lower than the operating earnings, primarily because of derivative losses of $3.2 billion after tax. For more details about the difference between operating earnings and net income, please reference page 3 in our supplemental slide disclosure this quarter.  Page 4 in the supplemental slides shows the attribution of the after-tax derivative loss. As Steve noted, a significant rise in U.S. interest rates this quarter primarily drove this result. The interest rate impact in the fourth quarter was a loss of $2.2 billion after tax on derivatives outside our VA program, as highlighted in the slides. However, more than this amount, $2.3 billion, is what we consider asymmetrical accounting driven by current U.S. GAAP.  In addition, the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives in our VA program this quarter accounted for a loss of $854 million after tax or the vast majority of the remainder. More than half of this total or $467 million after tax, was due to nonperformance risk, also commonly referred to as owned credit. We view owned credit as noneconomic. In total, $3 billion out of the $3.2 billion after-tax derivative loss or approximately 94%, was attributable to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting.  Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $49.83 as of December 31, down 3% year over year, primarily due to the impact of the derivative losses. Tangible book value per share was $41.14 as of December 31, also down 3% year over year.  With respect to fourth quarter underwriting margins, total company earnings were lower by approximately $0.16 per share versus the prior-year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting and Brighthouse accounted for approximately $0.10 of the total decrease, primarily due to the previously disclosed quarterly impact of the loss of the aggregation benefit in a veritable and universal life or VNUL, as well as unfavorable mortality.  Excluding Brighthouse, underwriting earnings were lowered by approximately $0.06 per share year over year. This was primarily due to less favorable mortality experience in Group Benefits and MetLife Holdings, as well as a one-time $14 million reserve adjustment in long term care to update assumptions on 2016 claims.  The Group life mortality ratio was 88.2%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 86.8%, but within the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We had a reserve refinement on a small block of claims this quarter. Adjusting for this refinement, the Group life mortality ratio was 86.9%, essentially in line with the prior-year quarter. For full-year 2016, the Group life mortality ratio was 87.2%, below the midpoint of its targeted range.  MetLife Holdings interest adjusted benefit ratio for life products was 63.5%, higher than the prior-year quarter of 58.7%, due to claim severity and less favorable reassurance on some large claims. Finally, the Group nonmedical health interest adjusted loss ratio was 76.2%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 77.0% and modestly better than the 2016 annual target range of 77% to 82%. For full-year 2016, the interest adjusted loss ratio for nonmedical health was 78.3%, below the midpoint of the targeted range.  Turning to investment margins, the weighted average of the three product spreads in our QFS was 165 basis points in the quarter, up 11 basis points year over year. We believe a weighted average is the better measure for U.S. spreads in our QFS as retirement and income solutions represents roughly 3/4 of the total asset base for Remain-Co.  Pre-tax variable investment income or VII, was $301 million, up $192 million versus the prior-year quarter, driven by strong private equity performance. Product spreads excluding VII were 133 basis points this quarter, down 3 basis points year over year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. Overall, higher investment margins in the second quarter accounted for approximately $0.05 of EPS improvement year over year.  In regards to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.0% and 22.7% after adjusting for the notable items this quarter related to the Company's unit cost initiative. The ratio was favorable to the prior-year quarter of 24.4% which did not include any notable expense items primarily due to the sale of Premier Client Group expense efficiencies. Overall, better expense margins contributed approximately $0.11 of EPS improvement versus the prior-year quarter.  I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $174 million, up 14% and 9% adjusted for notable items in the prior-year quarter. Primary drivers were favorable expense margins and volume growth. This is partially offset by less favorable mortality experience.  Group Benefits operating PFOs were $4 billion, up 5% year over year, driven by growth across all markets. Full-year 2016 Group Benefits sales were up 24% over the prior year, with strong growth across most products and market.  In addition, we're pleased with the start of the 2017 sales and renewal season. We're seeing continued strong persistency and solid sales across all market segments, as well as in both core and voluntary products. As a result, we expect 2017 PFO growth to be at the higher the end of our target range of 3% to 5%, excluding the loss of a large dental contract as discussed on our outlook call.  Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, reported operating earnings of $299 million, of 27% and 28% after adjusting for notable items in the prior-year quarter. The key drivers were higher investment margins and favorable underwriting. RIS operating PFOs were $895 million, up 5% year over year due to higher pension risk transfers or PRT which can be lumpy. We closed to PRT transactions totaling more than $500 million in the quarter. We continue to see a good PRT pipeline and expect 2017 to be an active year for transactions of all sizes. Our approach will continue to balance growth with an efficient use of capital.  Property & Casualty or P&C, operating earnings were $43 million, down 2% and 23% as adjusting for notable items in the prior-year quarter. The primary driver was less favorable auto results due to increased loss severity. Our claim frequency and average premium were close to expectations.  We have been taking targeted rate increases over the last 12 months and the fourth quarter of 2016, the average premium increase on renewing customers was approximately 7%. We continue to take similar rate increases in 2017. We expect these price increases, along with other management actions, to move the auto combined ratio toward the upper end of our 2017 guidance range of 95% to 100%.  P&C operating PFOs were $887 million, up 1% year over year. Overall P&C sales were down 9% to due to price increases and management actions to drive value.  Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $354 million, up 22% from the prior-year quarter and 8% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in the prior-year quarter. The key drivers were volume growth, favorable market impacts and a tax-related item in Japan. The stronger equity market in Japan and stronger dollar versus the yen helped earnings for the quarter through asset appreciation. Although Asia had a strong quarter, operating earnings excluding the one-time tax item and the favorable market conditions this quarter were in line with our guidance of $310 million plus or minus 5%.  Asia operating PFOs were $2.1 billion, up 5% from the prior-year quarter, but down 2% on a constant currency basis, due to the deconsolidation of the Company's India operations. Excluding the impact of the India deconsolidation, PFOs were up 2% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth in the life and A&H markets in Japan. Asia sales were essentially unchanged year over year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value in targeted markets. Sales in emerging markets were up 13%.  Latin America reported operating earnings of $122 million, down 22%, but up 5% constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in the prior-year quarter. The key drivers were favorable one-time tax items in the current quarter and volume growth.  Latin America operating PFOs were $913 million, down 2%, but up 5% on a constant currency basis. Total sales were essentially unchanged on a constant currency basis as higher group sales were offset by lower [indiscernible] sales. EMEA operating earnings were $72 million, up 33% year over year and 44% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were lower expenses and the unit cost initiative, a claims reserve release in the Gulf and volume growth. EMEA operating PFOs were $622 million, essentially unchanged from the prior-year period and up 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth of employee benefits. We continue to see a favorable shift towards higher margin products. Total EMEA sales increased 5% on a constant currency basis.  MetLife Holdings which primarily consists of our legacy retail and long term care runoff businesses, reported operating earnings of $199 million, down 25% year over year. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were down 3%, as unfavorable underwriting and investor margins were partially offset by lower expenses, including those related to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group in 2016. MetLife Holdings operating PFOs were $1.6 billion, down 9% year over year, mostly due to sale of MetLife Premier Client Group which included the Company's affiliated broker dealer unit.  Brighthouse Financial or BHF operating earnings were $330 million, down 15% and 32% after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The key drivers were unfavorable underwriting and life reserve changes. Including $44 million of the ongoing impact from the loss of the aggregation benefit for GAAP-reserve testing associated with the VNUL business, as well as lower sever account fees.  The $44-million impact was consistent with our prior guidance discussed on our 3Q earnings call. However, ongoing higher universal life reserves following a previously discussed model change in Q2 were $20 million in the quarter. In addition to the $10-million guidance, there was a one-time reserve adjustment for another $10 million.  As a reminder, the Brighthouse Financial segment results within MetLife's financial statements do not match the financial statements at Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and related companies shown in the most recent Brighthouse form 10 filings due to accounting timing differences.  BHF operating PFOs were $1.3 billion, down 15% year over year. Excluding the impact of single-premium income annuities and reinsurance recaptures, operating PFOs were down 8% due to lower fees for annuities as a result of continued negative fund flows. BHF continues to see strong sales growth from Shield Level Selector which was up 45% year over year.  Next, I would like to discuss the Company's a low effective tax rate this quarter of 17.3%. As highlighted on page 5 of the supplemental slides, the key drivers were revised estimates of the U.S. tax on the dividend from Japan which reversed the tax expense taken into 2Q 2016; increased tax credits; an inter quarter catch-up adjustment; and a favorable audit settlement.  Excluding these items, the Company's effective tax rate was 21.7% for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016. The 21.7% is reasonably close to the prior guidance we provided of 21.1% in the third quarter. Going forward, the Company's tax rate is projected to be approximately a 23%, consistent with our outlook call guidance.  I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets of the holding companies were approximately $5.8 billion at December 31 which is up from $5.6 billion at September 30. This increase reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our quarterly common dividend, share repurchases and other holding company expenses.  Please note that cash at the holding companies at year end was roughly $1 billion higher than anticipated. This was due to higher-than-projected cash of approximately $625 million, mainly due to lower collateral for derivatives and taxes, as well as timing of retail separation costs of close to $375 million which were shifted from 2016 to 2017. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect MetLife to receive between $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion in dividends from Brighthouse Financial prior to separation, subject to regulatory approvals.  In addition, our 2016 free cash flow ratio was 48% of reported operating earnings. However, the free cash flow ratio was 77% after adjusting for notable items, excluding the impact from actions related to the separation of Brighthouse. This was significantly above our 2016 target of 55% to 65%, primarily due to higher subsidiary dividends as well as lower operating earnings.  Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not completed our risk-based capital calculation for 2016, we estimate our U.S. combined RBC ratio, including Brighthouse, will remain above 400%. Preliminary full-year 2016 statutory operating earnings including Brighthouse were approximately $6 billion and net earnings including BHF were approximately $5.2 billion.  Statutory operating earnings increased by $2.4 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the favorable impact of equity markets and certain variable annuities, partially offset by lower net investment net income. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $25 billion as of December 31, 2016 which is down 14% from December 31, 2015. Dividends paid to the holding company, as well as both realized and unrealized losses, were partially offset by net earnings.  In statutory accounting, there is a balance sheet accounting misalignment between hedge assets and the associated liabilities. Hedge assets are mark to market; however, statutory reserves are less sensitive to interest rate changes. This asymmetry causes a reduction in statutory capital when interest rates rise. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 991% as of the third quarter of 2016 which is the latest public data.  At the core, MetLife had a solid fourth quarter. Higher investment margins and lower expenses offset underwriting weakness in the quarter. Our net loss was largely due to a significant rise in interest rates in the quarter. In total, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting drove approximately 94% of the derivative loss this quarter.  As Steve noted, higher interest rates are an economic a benefit for MetLife. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong and we remain confident that the steps we're taken to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long term sustainable value to our shareholders. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Sumit Kumar from Citi. Please go ahead.
Sumit Kumar: I wanted to start with MetLife Holdings if I could I don't know if you give guidance on this but do you have a sense of what the free cash flow conversion is out of that segment? 
John Hele: We haven't given details of it -- by segment yet and MetLife Holdings -- the goal of that is to optimize value for the shareholder and MetLife Holdings including cash flow so work underway with that over time will give you some more guidance on that but right now we give you the overall guidance for Remain-Co is 65% to 75% on average in 2017 and 2018. 
Sumit Kumar: Okay. And then I guess on the interest rate hedges, obviously some of those hedges are going to stay with some of them are going to go to Brighthouse so can you maybe give us a sense of how much you are benefiting from the interest rate hedges now and then what the trajectory is of that benefit over the next couple of years? 
John Hele: I'm just looking it up. So we have about a couple hundred million of benefit right now from that -- and about just under half of that is Brighthouse today and these hedges stay for a long time so they run well into 2020, 2022. That's a couple hundred million in the quarter? But yes. The quarter, I'm sorry -- that's also pre-tax. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Thomas Gallagher: Can you comment on the net income sensitivity to interest rates. We had the pretty big loss here and I realize your view is uneconomical but just curious with the next 82 100 basis point increase in rates have a similar GAAP net income loss or does the sensitivity change? Is it not symmetrical? 
John Hele: It depends both on the shape of the curve and how much it moves in the quarter, how these marks on derivatives moves we also have currency hedging and some other aspects to it so it's a little complex. We have instituted a plan, though, we're we looking at our hedging in total so we don't want to give any guidance on it now and we haven't decided how we're going to think about it. I mean, it's kind of an interesting balance, economically, we're better off even with these hedges from an economic balance sheet point of view but you have these noise through to the GAAP so how much do you want to spend money or change your hedging to protect GAAP? So we're examining various options because we're at these rates and if the rates go up further, we will be moving away from some of the more costly guarantees in our businesses that we maybe modify our hedging strategy but that is still work underway. 
Thomas Gallagher: Okay. And then, I guess the way I would think about is for these types of Mark to market losses on derivatives, to truly be uneconomical, I would have to think that it's not affecting your view of enterprise wide capital adequacy despite what sounds like some negative adjustments to statutory surplus? So can you kind of a reconcile those two things? And indicate whether there is at least an immediate negative impact on capital and how you and the rating agencies with you that? 
John Hele: So from a pure mark to market economic balance sheet MetLife is better off end of the year than in the third quarter and second quarter. But the accounting does have timing issues sometimes. So there is, as you can see, there are some statutory capital but we're still -- have our guidance and reconfirming our 65 to 75 free cash flow for 2017 and 2018 for Remain-Co on average for 17 and 18 so it hasn't change that amount long term it's very good for the business what we think about that net present value of cash flows.
Thomas Gallagher: And just one final one relates to that is I get the rate hedges related to the variable annuity business but can you comment a little more broadly since most of the loss was outside of the year, at least the accounting loss, is it mainly universal life insurance related hedges? Is that related to your pension business? Can you provide a little more granularity for what exactly there's in terms of the liabilities that you're hedging there? 
Steve Kandarian: These were general interest rate hedges purchased over years to protect against low rates across the Board and particularly we do have some long liabilities, long term care, for example that need a protected gains of some other longer liabilities so that's what it's protecting the gains and we've had them for a long time and they reduce to the income for us in a very positive way as the rates go up they produce less income now and they do have this Mark to market to the balance sheet to this asymmetrical accounting but that's why it's a big piece of it and less in the VA book. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Seth Weiss : Understand the balance sheet income of the accounting a cement surely debatable but just wanted to see if you can reiterate your view on the near term earnings impact from higher interest rates and just wanted to double check necessarily a positive with rates moving up and maybe more specifically could you categorize what the impact to earning as from what you're losing of what's being kicked off in the derivative book for higher rates and how that is immediately offset by the earnings impact of the and force business and how to think about any timing lag that may exist between those two forces? 
John Hele: Right. Well, there is an impact. It depends on how rates go up, the short the end goes up because the short and can affect the derivative income. If we have 100 basis points increase in rates affecting operating up, right up from where we're now, you have the positive from rising rates and the reinvestment of the portfolio and you'd also have a lesser derivative income. It would be -- if it's spiked up today, the subsidy would be kind of a wash in 17 at about 100 million in 2018 and $150 million in 2019. 
Seth Weiss: And then if we think about so the book value basis, is there a way to separate out the value of the derivative portfolio? From book value? Just to get maybe a cleaner cents, a more consistent sense of what book value is or similar to what you do we with the 2015 adjustment or the FCTA adjustment? 
Steve Kandarian: That is complex. Because you have to go way back and where do you start? And how do the calculations? So I think unfortunately the answer is you are going to have to wait until the accounting is modified at some point in the future. It's been about 10 years we've been working on it but the hope is to have a better balance sheet for insurers and this work by FASB underway to move towards that. 
Seth Weiss: So you can give just and EPI per share amount of what those derivatives and opposition is what today -- 
Steve Kandarian: Well, the total values are disclosed in our balance sheet if you divide the number of shares outstanding but to try to equate to get to the true book value, the true economic value is assets liabilities that's what I mean it's not a useful number because you don't know the true economic value of the liabilities to really figure out what is the true economic book value. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: First said of the question just on your Latin America business, and specifically on Mexico your sales in the business were pretty weak I think mostly related to the weak volume that if you could just discuss how economically sensitive the businesses and I think portion of is it -- is group sales and how susceptible are you to potential weakening in the economy in Mexico? 
Steve Kandarian: So as we disclosed, the quarter in general terms revenues are 5% are fine. We have weaker sales in Mexico which you know is -- impacting the lower sales not necessarily directly correlated with the top line because it's previously put in terms of the impact in the economy, obviously monitoring how the situation evolves including discussions about NAFTA. I have to say that our business partner in Mexico is fairly unrelated to any trade agreements so it's just tied to the general economy. Of the market we normally grow each rate to the market growth rate. 
Jimmy Bhullar: And then, just on the Brighthouse business if you look at your sales of the two major products, annuities and life insurance, individual life insurance, there opposed weak a lot in part of the distribution which is really -- so how do you think about the growth outlook for that business down the road, given that it seems that annuity flows are going to be negative for a while even with growth in the shield product and just a life -- Individual Life book seems to be shrinking. 
Eric Steigerwalt: I really can't talk about Outlook right now but I can give you a little sense. Will, where we're in the fourth quarter is right around where we thought we would be put on the what I would call the normal variable annuity business obviously there has been an FX from DOL. You’ve seen that on other competitors as well. The life this is we kind of expected as we sold off the MPC gene field force and they shifted it to their new company. But the shield sales are fantastic, up 45%, quarter over quarter, so we're seeing some momentum in I would say what I call a normal VA business we continue to see momentum in the shield business light of the life business was clearly weak in the fourth quarter and will have to work on that in coming quarters going forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sean Dargan: I want to follow up on something John mentioned around the FASB proposals for long term insurance contracts so if I understand correctly, insurance liabilities will be fair value to every quarter. Is that something that MetLife supports? 
Steve Kandarian: We're very active with the FASB on this. The concept makes a lot of sense. That was in the details. The big question is what interest rate do you bring the liabilities back at a lot of discussion with the FASB on that and that work is still underway. A lot of the changes, though, would flow-through -- I think the proposals flow-through AOCI and not give noise to operating earnings so you still see the operating earnings peace and the noise would flow-through the AOCI. 
Sean Dargan: And then I have a question about proposed tax reform. If U.S. corporate taxes get lowered, how do you think the industry and regulators respond? Do you -- would you target and after-tax return and cut pricing or do think the industry would as a whole? Or do you think regulators would require pricing cuts? 
Steve Kandarian: I think it's pretty hard to answer a question right now about tax reform because it's so early stage. Chairman Brady of the House Ways and Means Committee has a blueprint out will have to see where that goes. There's been some support for it and other reporters of the economy are concerned about the border adjustability component still a lot of knowledge has to be gained in terms of how that will actually work and with the details will be so it's really premature for me right now to say how it will affect those factors. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Can you comment on the expected earnings run light for MetLife Holdings and if there's any residual impact from the highlight -- the items you highlighted this quarter? 
John Hele: No. The guidance we gave that our Outlook still applies for next year there's noise this quarter and some worse mortality than we had thought we had a couple large claims that fell through but we would stick with the guidance we gave you on the call. 
Erik Bass: Okay. And then on interest rates, you'd mentioned that the rise in new money rates, how much more would rates need to rise to sort of get you towards where your portfolio yield as and eliminate the drag from spread compression? 
Steve Kandarian: Well, you highlight one of the sensitivities there and this is Steve -- at the way we look at it is if you were to hold all spreads constant across asset sectors, what has to happen to the 10 year treasury? Which is a primary indicator for where we're investing and it's approximately about a 3% U.S. Treasury rate of 10 years and again it's assuming all spreads stay the same but that would be about where we would hit our breakeven on reinvesting. 
Erik Bass: And I guess when you hit that point, would you expect to get some spread benefit initially before having to share that with policyholders? 
Steve Kandarian: I think we'll have to wait and see. It will be nice to not have spread compression that we've been fighting for years and we look forward to dealing with that issue going forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Nadel: Just a question I'm thinking about the 2017 Outlook and taking into account all the moving parts in the fourth quarter results at the same levels are there any segments where you would say the baseline that you identified six or seven weeks ago that you talked about back in December that where the baseline has changed materially on sort of the core basis where we need to adjust our expectations for 2017? 
John Hele: No. We would not adjust our Outlook and we would try to tell that to you if we had a change to our Outlook but thanks for the question. 
John Nadel: Okay. And then, second one is just can you give us an update on any asset adequacy reserve additions of any note for 2016 year end? 
Steve Kandarian: Well, actually with interest rates going up at we've asset adequacy reserves. We have better buffers now than with the rising rates and look forward to a future of not having to add to those for a while so we -- this has been a very -- as I said, economically very favorable to MetLife with the rise in rates. 
John Nadel: And then last one real quick you didn't give an update and I suppose that means nothing's changed but can you still confirm that the spinoff is expected to take place in the first half? 
Steve Kandarian: Yes, our target is still the first half of 2017 for the Brighthouse separation. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: John, you mentioned $625 million benefit to the holding company's cash position. Is that something that you would view as a permanent benefit or should we think about that as potentially-- 
John Hele: Some of that was tax which we have so we have the cash and then another piece was collateral for derivatives so depending upon what happens to currencies interest rates, the collateral postings can change. And we'll just have to wait and see. That's on that piece. 
Ryan Krueger: Okay. And then, on Brighthouse, could you just quantified I guess for the quarter, how much weaker worthy underwriting results relative to what you would have expected? 
Eric Steigerwalt: I would say about $19 million but I would say this. This comparison, fourth quarter of 2015, was a very good underwriting quarter for us. Whether you look at what we expected or maybe an average run rate over eight or nine, quarters, it was a very good underwriting quarter. This quarter, our fourth quarter, 2016 while it is weaker maybe than we expected, slightly weaker than we expected over the last eight, quarters, it's right on the average so similar to what MetLife experienced a little bit of severity and a little less seated but despite the fact that it cost us some earnings, not that far off of what we expect. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank Securities. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: John, I think you reiterated your day cash flow target of 65% to 75% for the next couple of years. Would it be fair to expect a cash flow conversion to be a bit on the lower end for 2017 and then maybe more they catch up in 2018? Just given where the statutory capital and earnings are today? And then the separation costs? 
John Hele: So I think I understand your question but free cash flow is a lot of moving parts to it and it is a bit volatile from year-to-year so we give you an average over two years and we're confident in our rage at 65 to 75 but I can't give you an individual year target. 
Yaron Kinar: Okay. But directionally, would it be fair to expect maybe the cash flows moving up as the year moves on? 
John Hele: Directionally, we -- I'm reiterating our range. At this time, it is a bit volatile from time to time. 
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And then, in RIS, if one excludes the pension transfers I think PFOs were actually came under some considerable pressure this quarter. Can you maybe talk about that a little bit and maybe also have any color or any extrapolations that you may see for that into 2017? 
Maria Morris: This is Maria Morris. Obviously RIS has a number of different products as part of it was our institutional income annuities block that was down this quarter, quarter over quarter, we're in a process as you know a balancing kind of value and growth in this marketplace and so we're comfortable with where we ended up and going into next year we have focused plans on each of these markets. In the income annuities business we're seeing some increase in different sponsors, interested in this product line, so we do believe that will go back to traditional growth in the future. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Randy Binner : I wanted to talk about just expenses and confirm that the overall expense savings initiative of the $800 million is still on track. I think it is but more specifically I think that you talked about the December costs associated with the expense initiative $300 million pre-tax initiative and '17 is that still on course now that we're in 2017 and is there any update or color you could give us on how the timing of that $300 million of cost associated with the expense initiative is going to come in in 2017? 
John Hele: Yes, we're on track to the outlook we gave you for the cost savings. As you remember, we spent a lot in in 2017 to get these savings later on, a lot of technology investments. It is spread out throughout the year perhaps a little more in the second half than the first half, but we will isolate these for you each and every time and so you can see these pieces of what the investments are to create the savings. 
Randy Binner: And then just a quick when I wanted to cover the long term care, there's a little bit of an adjustment in holdings. Can you just give a quick update on what the behavior versus interest rate assumptions were that change it wasn't mostly interest rate that change? 
John Hele: In long term care, we adjusted the claims we had in 2016. We updated at the end of the year for those claims what we were seeing -- we were seeing a little less termination of those claims so we had to adjusted reserves on that. Is a small amount relative to the total size of our long term care, remember that we have about $10 billion of GAAP reserves on this business, about $13 billion and so this is a small change within the total and only affecting the 2016 claims. 
Operator: At this time there are no further questions. 
Steve Kandarian: Okay that brings us close to the top of the hour, it's a busy morning. Thank you to everyone for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you during the quarter. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results, and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors sections of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.
John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm John Hall, MetLife's Head of Investor Relations. On this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And finally, given the busy insurance earnings calendar this morning, we will end the call promptly at the top of the hour. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1.28. The quarter was characterized by a rebound in variable investment income and solid expense control. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.53 per share, which compares to $1.36 per share on the same basis in the prior-year period. Two actions account for most of the notable items – the re-segmentation of our business and our annual actuarial assumption review. First, following re-segmentation, the Brighthouse segment will no longer receive an aggregation benefit associated with GAAP reserve testing of its variable and universal life policies. This previously-announced charge lowered operating earnings by $254 million. Second, we completed our annual actuarial assumption review in the third quarter. This review covered all of our global businesses with the exception of variable annuities, which we updated last quarter. The actuarial assumption review lowered operating earnings by $65 million. Compared to a year ago, equity markets, which were up 3.3% in the quarter as measured by the S&P 500, had a favorable impact of $80 million, while most other market factors had little impact. Among other earnings items, underwriting results were weaker in Individual and Group Life as well as in Property & Casualty. John Hele will discuss underwriting in greater detail. In addition to generating more of our earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, the settlement of several income tax audits benefited normalized results and reduced our quarterly effective tax rate to 20.6%. Finally, a below-the-line goodwill write-off served to eliminate Brighthouse's remaining goodwill. Moving to investments, variable investment income totaled $409 million in the quarter, which is above the high end of our quarterly guidance range of $375 million. Higher returns associated with private equity and real estate joint ventures contributed to the outperformance. While we continue to face reinvestment rate pressure, recurring investment income benefited in the quarter from higher asset balances. In the quarter, our global new money yield stood at 2.89%. This compares to a roll-off rate of 4.78%. In the second quarter, our new money rate was 3.07% while the roll-off rate was 4.95%. Declining yields continue to pressure the entire life insurance industry. A prolonged period of artificially low interest rates would be easier to accept if it were achieving the stated goal of boosting economic growth, but that is not the case. The U.S. economy continues to muddle along at a less than 2% growth rate and the global economy at around 3%. In our view, the world has become too dependent on monetary policy to solve its economic challenges. Fiscal policy must play a larger role in fueling growth as it has done historically. Pro-growth tax reform and targeted spending increases on infrastructure would accelerate economic expansion. Over the longer term, entitlement reform would reduce the nation's debt burden, and sensible regulatory relief combined with a more constructive tone in Washington would boost business confidence and spur greater economic activity and job growth. The alternative of continuing to rely exclusively on unconventional monetary policy will only prolong a massive transfer of wealth from savers to borrowers. Artificially low interest rates punish those on fixed incomes including the elderly and make the cost of financial protection more expensive at a time when social safety nets are under increasing pressure. Turning to regulatory matters, I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal of the U.S. District Court decision rescinding MetLife's designation as a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. On October 24, oral argument in the case was held before three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. MetLife used the opportunity to vigorously defend the District Court's carefully reasoned opinion. We continue to believe we have a strong case on the merits and look forward to a final decision from the D.C. Circuit Court in the coming months. The losing party has the option of appealing to the full bench of the D.C. Circuit Court or to the U.S. Supreme Court. Following the close of the quarter, we achieved several important milestones in conjunction with our planned separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. Shortly after our September board of directors meeting, we filed a Form-10 for Brighthouse Financial with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the same time, we filed a companion 8-K providing insight into how we expect the planned separation would affect MetLife. We also filed a re-segmented quarterly financial supplement with historical information on the new segments. We are working through the regulatory approval process and do not foresee any issues that cannot be resolved. We believe the separation remains on track for the first half of 2017. Shifting to expenses, I would like to provide an update on our unit cost improvement program. As we explained on the Q2 earnings call, by 2020, the program will achieve pre-tax run rate savings of $800 million net of stranded overhead associated with the planned separation of Brighthouse Financial. In order to generate these annual savings, we plan to invest approximately $1 billion from 2016 to 2019 with these one-time investments spread out over the four-year period. The unit cost program reflects one of the ways we are changing how we run our company. We are placing a strict cap on our expenses based on benchmarking against peers. If our peers improve their own expense ratios, our savings targets would need to move higher as well. Before I turn over the call to John to discuss our financial results in greater detail, I'd like to remind you that we are hosting an Investor Day on November 10. I know you have a lot of questions on capital management and return on equity. We will not be addressing those questions today, but will cover capital management and ROE comprehensively at next week's Investor Day. We'll also highlight MetLife's new brand direction and provide a full overview of our refreshed enterprise strategy. Our accelerating value work has sharpened our focus on cash and capital efficiency, and we look forward to telling you more about our work in these areas. Now to John.
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our third quarter results including a discussion of our insurance underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. Operating earnings in third quarter were $1.4 billion or $1.28 per share. This quarter included four notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS. First, the establishment of a Brighthouse Financial segment resulted in the loss of an aggregation benefit associated with the GAAP reserve testing of variable and universal life or V&UL policies. This decreased operating earnings by $254 million or $0.23 per share after tax. Second, results of the actuarial assumption review completed in the third quarter for all products other than U.S. variable annuities resulted in a decrease to net income of $59 million and along with other insurance adjustments, decreased operating earnings by $65 million or $0.06 per share after tax. This charge was primarily due to a change in the earned rate assumption for the traditional life closed block in MetLife Holdings as well as deferred acquisition costs or DAC unlockings in EMEA and Asia. These were partially offset by favorable DAC unlockings in Brighthouse and Latin America. For long-term care, the annual loss recognition testing continues to reflect positive margins. Third, variable investment income was above the 2016 quarterly plan range by $22 million or $0.02 per share after tax and the impact of DAC. And fourth, favorable catastrophe experience and prior year development increased operating earnings by $16 million or $0.01 per share after tax. Adjusting for all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 11% year-over-year and 10% on a constant currency basis. On a per-share basis, operating earnings were $1.53, up 13% and 12% on a constant currency basis. Turning to our bottom line results. Third quarter net income was $571 million or $0.51 per share. Net income was $850 million lower than operating earnings primarily because of derivative net losses of $834 million related to changes in interest rates and equity markets. Additionally, the third quarter of 2016 includes a goodwill impairment of $223 million after tax, related to the new Brighthouse Financial segment driven by the separation. As part of the re-segmentation, the goodwill associated with the previous segments were allocated to the new reporting units in the segments including within Brighthouse and tested at that level. As a result, we wrote off all of the goodwill allocated to the Brighthouse life and runoff units. The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included an unfavorable impact of $360 million after tax related to asymmetrical and non-economic accounting. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FTCA was $53.40 as of September 30, up 4% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $44.40 as of September 30, up 5% year-over-year. With respect to third quarter underwriting margins, total company earnings were lower by approximately $0.12 per share versus the prior-year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting Brighthouse accounted for approximately $0.07 of the total, primarily due to the quarterly impact of the loss of the aggregation benefit in V&UL and unfavorable mortality. Excluding Brighthouse, underwriting earnings were lower by approximately $0.05 per share year-over-year due to less favorable mortality experience in Group Benefits and MetLife Holdings, as well as higher group disability claims in Mexico. The Group Life mortality ratio was 89.3%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 86.1% and at the high end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced higher claim severity versus the prior-year quarter, but remained in line with our expectations on a year-to-date basis. The non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 76.9%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 78.5% and modestly below the annual target range of 77% to 82%. For the year, non-medical health results have been better than our expectations. MetLife Holdings interest-adjusted benefit ratio for Life products was 60.4% and 59.9% after adjusting for a notable reserve item as a result of the actuarial assumption review. On a comparable basis, the 59.9% ratio is unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 55.5%, primarily due to higher claims severity. Turning to investment margins, the weighted average of the three product spreads in our QFS was 167 basis points in the quarter, up 8 basis points year-over-year. We believe a weighted average is the better measure for U.S. spreads provided now in our QFS as Retirement & Income Solutions represents approximately 75% of the total asset base. Pre-tax variable investment income or VII was $409 million, up $142 million versus the prior-year quarter due to improved hedge fund performance, the sale of a real estate joint venture interest and stronger prepayments. Product spreads, excluding VII, were 138 basis points this quarter, up 4 basis points year-over-year. Higher asset balances and portfolio optimization accounted for most of this increase. Overall, higher investment margins in the quarter accounted for approximately $0.04 of EPS improvement year-over-year. With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 20.1%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 24.2% and 21.4% after adjusting for the interest-related component of the non-cash charge in the third quarter of 2015. The lower operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group, lower employee benefits and other expense efficiencies. Overall, better expense margins contributed approximately $0.09 of EPS improvement versus the prior-year quarter. I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter based on the new operating segmentation as disclosed in our 8-K filed on October 20. The U.S. segment is comprised of Group Benefits, Retirement & Income Solutions, and Property & Casualty. The remaining five segments are Asia, Latin America, EMEA, MetLife Holdings, and Brighthouse Financial. Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $186 million, up 5% versus the prior-year quarter and 2% adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were non-medical health underwriting and higher investment margins. This was partially offset by a less favorable mortality experience. Group Benefits' operating PFOs were $4.1 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by growth across all products. Sales were up 31% year-to-date, with strong growth across most products and markets. Retirement & Income Solutions, or R&IS, reported operating earnings of $308 million, up 15% versus the prior-year quarter and 24% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was higher investment margins. R&IS operating PFOs were $1.4 billion, down 13% year-over-year due to lower pension risk transfers, or PRT, versus a strong third quarter of 2015. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy, but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities. Excluding PRT, operating PFOs were up 8%. Property & Casualty, or P&C, operating earnings were $58 million, down 13% versus the prior-year quarter and also down 13% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary driver was non-catastrophe homeowners' losses, partially offset by an improvement in non-catastrophe auto results. In auto, we have been taking targeted rate increases over the last 12 months. And in the third quarter of 2016, the average premium increase on renewing customers was approximately 6%. These increases, along with other management actions, should increase an improving auto combined ratio in the upcoming quarters, adjusting for seasonality. P&C operating PFOs were $882 million, up 1% year-over-year. P&C sales were down 5% due to pricing actions as well as a shift toward more profitable business segments and markets. Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $324 million, down 4% from the prior-year quarter and 5% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The prior-year quarter had favorable volume growth and benefited from $21 million of investment income from a loan sale as well as one-time tax benefits. In the current quarter, Asia results benefit from strong volume growth and lower expenses. Asia operating PFOs were $2.2 billion, up 4% from the prior-year quarter, but down 9% on a constant currency basis due to the impact of the withdrawal in Japan of single premium accident & health yen products in 2015 and the deconsolidation of the company's India operations. Asia sales were down 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 10% year-over-year. We have seen a successful shift in sales to higher return foreign currency-denominated life products, which nearly doubled year-over-year and away from low-return yen life products, which were down 50% year-over-year. Continuing that trend, we expect over 90% of Japan sales in 2017 to come from higher-margin foreign-denominated and protection products. Japan's third sector sales were down 31% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single premium A&H and the negative impact on package sales from a reduction in yen-denominated whole life product sales. Asia did have strong sales in emerging markets, which were up 24%. Latin America reported operating earnings of $133 million, down 27% from the prior-year quarter, but up 12% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were market impacts and volume growth. Latin American operating PFOs were $891 million, up 4%, and 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. Latin America sales were down 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower group and AFORE sales. EMEA operating earnings were $74 million, up 12% year-over-year and 61% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were favorable underwriting, lower expenses and several non-recurring items as well as volume growth. EMEA operating PFOs were $621 million, essentially unchanged from the prior year period, but up 3% on a constant currency basis driven by growth in employee benefits and accident & health. We continue to see a favorable shift towards higher-margin products. Total EMEA sales increased 10% on a constant currency basis. MetLife Holdings, which primarily consists of our legacy retail and long-term care runoff businesses, reported operated earnings of $266 million, up 9% versus the prior-year quarter primarily due to higher variable investment income. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were essentially flat, as favorable markets and lower expenses were offset by weaker underwriting. MetLife Holdings operating PFOs were $1.6 billion, down 9% year-over-year mostly due to the sale of the former MetLife Premier Client Group, which included the company's broker-dealer unit. Brighthouse Financial, or BHF, operating earnings were $68 million, down 80% versus the prior-year quarter. The key driver was the previously-discussed $254 million one-time loss related to the re-segmentation of MetLife's business to establish a BHF segment as well as the current quarter impact of $42 million. The ongoing impact to BHF from the loss of the aggregation benefit is expected to be approximately $40 million per quarter after tax, gradually declining over time. Please note that the Brighthouse Financial segment results within MetLife's financial statements do not match Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and related companies' financial statements shown in the Form 10 due to accounting timing differences. Excluding the one-time loss of $254 million and all other notable items in both periods, operating earnings were down 22% due to unfavorable underwriting and higher taxes. This was partially offset by favorable markets and lower expenses. BHF operating PFOs were $1.3 billion, down 13% year-over-year due to lower fees for annuities as a result of continued negative fund flows and lower premiums due to a decline in SPI sales. BHF annuity sales were down 34%, and life sales were down 46%, mostly resulting from the suspension of sales through one distributor and lower sales from the former MetLife Premier Client Group. Conversely, BHF continues to see strong growth from Shield Level Selector, which was up 54% year-over-year. In Corporate & Other, we had an operating gain of $4 million compared to an operating loss of $983 million in the third quarter of 2015. In 3Q 2015, Corporate & Other results included a non-cash charge of $792 million related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned UK investment subsidiary of MLIC. In Q3 2016, the key driver for the operating gain is a lower effective tax rate, which included a true-up to our projected tax run rate of 22.1% and a benefit related to the settlement of certain income tax audits. Adjusting for these items, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.6%. Despite the operating gain in the quarter, we expect Corporate & Other's full-year 2016 operating loss to be within the guidance range of $500 million to $700 million. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets of the holding companies were approximately $5.6 billion at September 30, which is up from $4.9 billion at June 30. This increase reflects subsidiary dividends, proceeds from the sale of the former MetLife Premier Client Group, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses. Turning to our capital position, we report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. For Japan, our core solvency margin ratio was 952% as of the second quarter of 2016, which is the latest public data. For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date third quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.4 billion, and net earnings were approximately $2.2 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $2.1 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the favorable impact of equity markets on certain variable annuity reserves and the impact of a prior-year tax charge. We estimate that our U.S. statutory total adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of September 30, up 3% from December 31. In conclusion, MetLife had a solid third quarter. Investment margins, driven by an improvement in variable investment income and lower expenses, offset underwriting weakness in the quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong, and we remain confident that the steps we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, good morning. My first question was on the $1 billion of investments to achieve the cost saves. Should we expect those to, I guess, one, be fairly gradual over the four-year period? And then two, will they be reported in the operating earnings like you did with your prior cost save program?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Ryan. This is John. We expect those to be spread over the period of time, a little less in 2016 and then sort of roughly evenly over the time period remaining, and we'll give you some more details next week on all of this, and this will be in operating.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then just to clarify, did you say that your expectation for the consolidated tax rate going forward is 22.1%?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: I couldn't quite hear, I think you asked if the ongoing – if the tax rate for this year will be 22.1%, and that's correct.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Is that your expectation going forward as well, though?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Yes.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. I have a question about Brighthouse Financial while it's being reported within MetLife. I'm just wondering if there will be any headwinds from the loss of aggregation benefit in the next couple of quarters that we should expect to see while that's part of MetLife.
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Sean, this is John. As I mentioned in my remarks, I said we had $42 million in this quarter from it and we expect about $40 million a quarter, gradually declining over time. So, yes, there will be an impact.
Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, yes. I'm sorry about that. And then I'm just wondering, did not see any charges in MetLife Holdings from – attributable to long-term care. I'm just wondering how the margins are holding up as you review the actuarial assumptions in that product in the quarter.
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Right. We just finished our GAAP loss recognition testing for that and it's still quite sufficient. Our GAAP reserves and our stat reserves are very solid there too. As you may have seen, we have been putting through price increases and have been getting what we expect. We don't expect to get them in all states at all times, but it has been within our expectations and our plans for the rate actions that we filed.
Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. I had a question on just sales in Asia, they were down 11%. So just wondering what your outlook is for the Asian business in terms of sales growth, and specifically in Japan, given the pullback from the yen whole life market and also the weakness in third sector sales there.
Christopher G. Townsend - MetLife, Inc.: It's Chris Townsend here. Let me just sort of run through the sales overall in Asia. So, the high-level number was minus 11% for the quarter. So the shortfall there really was all about Japan and Korea. The high points were emerging markets were up 24%, and Asia ex-Japan and Korea was up 10%. For Japan, all the sales shortfall really is around the A&H business, which was down 31%. And you should think about that in terms of a third, a third, a third in terms of the shortfall, a third being due to the withdrawal of single premium A&H products, a third in terms of the package yen life sales. As we flip the life business effectively from yen whole life to foreign currency, we lose some of those package sales, and a third is also for a reduction in terms of the sponsor direct marketing business where the economics weren't appropriate for us. On the life side, whilst you see a number of about minus 3%, you should note the comments that John made earlier in terms of the really big shift we've made from yen life to foreign currency, which has higher value overall. And the other shortfall was Korea. The whole market is down in Korea in terms of the economic situation in that market, and we've pulled back in some of the independent agency business there again, because the commissions are too high and the value is too low. So, that's sort of the overall story for Asia. I think you'll see that continue for the fourth quarter, although A&H sales in Japan will recover slightly as compared to the prior three quarters.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: On the yen whole life, are you completely done making the product changes and pulling the products that you – from all the distribution channels or is that an ongoing process and could result in a further slowdown in the fourth quarter?
Christopher G. Townsend - MetLife, Inc.: Well, you should note that we made significant changes in that portfolio well before the negative interest rate policy came to bear and we were one of the first movers to close down a bunch of that business. The yen whole life sales for us are about 6% of our total sales this quarter. We've made very significant changes. There's a couple more changes we made recently in terms of stopping yen life sales in the bank channel and also stopping sales for the younger cohort. So, that's really the final changes. There will be a re-pricing of all of the yen life products in the market next year in April when the standard interest rate changes come in, but as John mentioned, we're pretty much out of the yen life business – the yen whole life business in Japan right now.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then if I could ask one more just for John, you mentioned the $1.53 earnings number ex some of the unusuals you highlighted. Obviously, there's a tax benefit in there. But even if you take out, let's say, $0.10 for taxes, it's still a fairly high number. So, to what extent do you view maybe a $1.40 to $1.45-ish number normalized for taxes as indicative of your earnings power going forward or do you feel that some of the businesses over-earned this quarter?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Well, Jimmy, that sounds a bit like an earnings guidance question.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: No, not necessarily guidance, but I realize results move around, but maybe you could talk about if you feel that maybe P&C margins were unusually strong, or some of the businesses that were...
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: VII was at the top end of the range – or slightly over the top that we normalize a little bit for. So, that's probably a little higher than what we would expect. We would expect more at the midpoint of the range, I think, on an ongoing basis. We also had some good equity market impacts in the quarter that affected MetLife Holdings as well as BHF, and we had some good expenses. We also had some underwriting. The group life was a little higher than we'd seen so far this year. So there were some pluses and minuses throughout the quarter, but as we said, we thought this was a strong third quarter.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Good morning. First question is on MetLife Holdings. I guess just going back to when you guys announced the sale of the MetLife Premier Client Group, I think the guide was $250 million annual reduction in expenses related to it. But if I look at MetLife Holdings, there was a much larger drop than that if I annualize it from an expense standpoint. So just curious if the earnings benefit you're going to get from that is going to be substantially greater than that $250 million or so number that you first gave out. And I think you had also said that was going to be split between Brighthouse and Met RemainCo. So was there also going to be – or was there a Brighthouse benefit to that?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi. This is John. We said that the $250 million was split approximately between MetLife Holdings and Brighthouse, and that would be a full year, so let's take a partial year into account. And MetLife Holdings has a lot of things in it going on, including some of the costs and strands. So I think we'll have to give you more guidance on MetLife Holdings when we get to our outlook call in December and can give you more view on MetLife Holdings.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: But, John, has there been a change in, I guess, the expense benefit that you would expect to get through the transaction or is there something else going on here that's beyond that?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: No. That benefit is exactly coming through as we had thought.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Okay. And then my follow-up is just on Brighthouse. Steve, I guess the comments you made about $200 million of stranded costs, is that the way we should think about the expense ramp-up? Like if we take the two businesses, Met RemainCo and Brighthouse, and then think about separation, is the ramp-up of a $200 million figure what we should expect to see from Brighthouse versus pro forma levels that we're seeing right now?
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Tom, the number we gave you about stranded cost of $200 million we talked about last time relates to what would be stranded remaining with RemainCo, MetLife, if it wasn't addressed and we are addressing that in the expense initiative, the unit cost initiative that we discussed. Those numbers move around a little bit, so the $200 million may be closer to $250 million now as we refine our estimates, but the net number has not changed. Meaning, the higher the strand the more we'll have to drive the other expense saves. So the $800 million net number remains as is.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: But is there anything you can say on the ramp in expense levels that you would expect as Brighthouse becomes an independent company?
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: We will give you more detail into certainly MetLife going forward at the outlook call in December. As to Brighthouse, these expenses really are at RemainCo – RemainCo MetLife, and not at Brighthouse. This is the overhead at MetLife that we have to deal with, that's the stranded cost.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Okay. Understood. But just curious if you could just address that question? I don't know if you are able to, but if you could address the question of expense increases that we can think about as Brighthouse separates from MetLife.
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Let Eric – I'm going to give Eric a chance to address what you're talking about.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Right.
Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - MetLife, Inc.: Yeah. I think you're referring to, are costs at Brighthouse going to go up and you may be referring to, there will be some public company costs at Brighthouse that previously would never, of course, exist in Brighthouse as a segment within MetLife. And the answer is yes. There are some public company costs that Brighthouse, on a standalone basis, will incur once it's public.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes to the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning. If I could just stay on this theme of the corporate expenses. Just to clarify, the stranded overhead that's running through corporate now, is that in the number for the next two, three quarters while Brighthouse still technically remains part of MetLife or would only start to exist starting at the back half of next year?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: That will happen after separation. It's John.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then in terms of the $800 million of net benefits, can you give us a sense of how that ramps up between now and the 2019 goal?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi. This is John. We'll give you some more details on that next week, but it's not a hockey stick, so it does spread out over the period of time.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. And if I could just sneak in one numbers question on Brighthouse, I think last quarter you brought the GAAP long-term interest rate assumption down to 4.25%. Can you just comment on what that looks like on a statutory basis?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Well, it's John. In statutory, we do the New York's seven tests, which starts at a level rate as of year-end of the prior year. So the 10-year Treasury was at 1.70%, if I remember correctly, at year-end. So all of our reserves are tested in all our U.S. statutory entities (43:48) at that level.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And I'm sorry, what's the ramp-up as part of that scenario?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: For standard reserves and cash flow testing, it's level. There's a shock down that then goes back up again. For the VA carbon reserves, it matches the long-term assumptions, slowly ramps up from the current 1. – year-end 10-year Treasury at year-end ramping up slowly to the 4.25% over 11 years.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I have a question on Brighthouse. So you're running there with a 700% plus risk-based capital ratio, and I think versus what we would typically think would be a more normalized 400% that implies excess capital of about $3 billion. But your Form-10 also talks about a $3 billion differential if you held VA reserves of the CTE(98) versus CTE(95). I guess my question is, you know Eric, is that a coincidence or should we read into this that management expects to have to run the company supporting the CTE(98) level of reserves on an ongoing basis?
Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - MetLife, Inc.: No. I think the best way to think about it is we'll bifurcate it. The non-VA business, think about a targeted RBC ratio of 400%. And then the VA business CTE(95) plus the $3 billion, which gets you in the range of CTE(98), CTE(99). The initial starting point, which we have in the F-10, says that that would be roughly at $700 million. But I think the best way to think about it is the way I just said, 400% non-VA and then CTE(95) plus the $3 billion buffer, which will obviously move around over time for the VA business.
John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And so if the overall risk-based capital ratio right now is over 700%, that would imply that the non-VA piece is well above 400%, I guess.
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi. This is John. Just let me just add in here. No, so the target is 400% for non-VA.
John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah.
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: VA will be run not to an RBC target, but a CTE(95) plus a buffer. The initial buffer is $3 billion, but as explained in the Form-10, that buffer will vary depending upon market conditions and is used as a buffer for the hedging strategy over time. So it will fluctuate up and down depending upon market conditions. So it's really quite a different way, I think, from looking at it, and this is quite unique, I think, to what Brighthouse is trying to do, and there's a lot of good explanation on this in the Form-10 that I know Eric looks forward to explaining to you over time.
John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): No. I understand, I've been through it. I guess I'm trying to follow up and understand if the overall RBC ratio for Brighthouse is at 700% plus, that would imply based on the commentary, I believe, that the non-VA is carrying excess capital while the VA piece might not be. Is it reasonable?
Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - MetLife, Inc.: I would say that the – if you're thinking about what gets it to 700%, the vast majority of that is the $3 million buffer.
John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah.
Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - MetLife, Inc.: Okay. So, the non-VA 400%, 400% plus, but what gets the combined ratio now up to the 700% is when you do the calculation and bring in that $3 billion, which of course we're really thinking about on a CTE basis, but that's what gooses the RBC.
John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Understood. And then if I could just switch to Japan, there are some efforts underway there that looks like it might replace the SMR ratio with something closer to a Solvency II type of approach. We've heard from a few companies their views on this change, and I was hoping you could offer some thoughts around this as well, particularly given how significant the Japanese business will be as a percentage of RemainCo post the spinoff?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi. This is John. There have been studies underway by the Japanese regulator to think about a more Solvency II type approach. This is under study by them. With negative interest rates, we'll have to see how they think about this. Clearly, Europe is having challenges thinking about using a Solvency II mark-to-market balance sheet when you have negative rates. You'd have to scratch your head a little bit on this. So I think it will be a while before Japan gets it really going forward, although we are actively working with the government on that.
John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. But, no. A couple of companies have provided estimates even under the approach that's under study. Anything you can provide there?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: We're not prepared to discuss it at this time. We think this is still quite a bit in fluctuation. And as I said, thinking about a mark-to-market balance sheet in negative interest rates is really a strange thing to think about.
John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR. Please go ahead.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey. Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask you a question back on MetLife Holdings and kind of specifically what kind of flow expectations we would have for the run-off areas of that segment, if you plan to engage in active programs to accelerate the run-off or if it's just going to be more status quo. And then the follow-up from that is what free cash flow conversion expectations might look like from there over time?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Randy. This is John. That's a great question. We are working hard on that. We have an executive now who's in charge of this whole business and his mandate is to optimize value for the shareholder from these blocks of business. We are taking some steps to lower costs. We've outsourced a good portion of the administration of this to CSC. You may have seen that announcement. That will save us money, and we'll be looking at further steps. It is complex, though. These businesses are not simple to deal with, both, say, the closed block we have. We have agreements with New York on that. We also have long-term care and this is all in our New York regulated entity, so we would need regulatory approvals on much of what we have to do, but nevertheless we will be working on this and we'll give you more guidance over time as we create plans on this.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Is it reasonable to assume that the free cash flow generation from that piece would be bigger than it was historically and probably a little bit better than the rest of RemainCo overall just because if you're winding down the required capital there, then that should free up capital?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: That's right. There's a lot of interactions going on. Both next week and at our outlook call, we'll give you more detailed guidance on this, but there's a lot of factors going on. We don't have the MetLife Premier Client Group sales anymore, the strain from that, which is a help. We also have narrowing spreads on our investment portfolio on these and the closed block going on, and it is a slow run-off over time. It's very long-term business, both the life business as well as the long-term care business, so it's not a short tail-type business. So there's a lot of complexity to it. That's why we have a smart person in charge of optimizing this for us, but we will give you more guidance as we develop our plans on this.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. First, Steve, I think you've taken a very cautious approach regarding the SIFI designation. And as you're going through the separation process now, can you maybe talk about how you're looking at SIFI given the fact that it's still being adjudicated at this point and then maybe government's approach is still not clear, at least to us, insofar as how it would deal with RemainCo or the new structure. So maybe you could give us a little bit of color on how you're thinking about it.
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Yaron, as you know, we're before the Circuit Court, when the government appealed the Lower Court ruling that designated MetLife as a SIFI. We'll have to wait and see what comes out of that court decision, and we think we'll hear that in the coming months here. As to the impact, I think you're really getting into the impact on our thinking around capital management. We certainly are taking that into account, and we'll talk more about capital management next week at our Investor Day.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. But as far as your thinking is concerned, is the risk profile, the regulatory risk profile, any different going forward?
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: The regulatory risk?
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes.
Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.: Oh. Once we separate out the U.S. Retail business, certainly it is a smaller company. Some of the liabilities and businesses that we're pointing to and FSOC's decision to designate us as a SIFI were concentrated in that business. So certainly it is a de-risked business going forward.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then another one probably for you, Steve. I'm hearing some frustration around fiscal monetary policies and those seem to be real headwinds for top line growth and spread compression as well. With those in mind, what avenues or what channels do you have for growing earnings, not so much the cash generation profile, but actual earnings in the company?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Well, after the separation, the company will be less focused on the U.S. in terms of the U.S. portion of the overall business, and we're in a number of other markets outside the United States, which are more rapidly growing, so that should help our overall growth rate. We also have businesses within the United States that remain at MetLife post separation that have good growth prospects including the Group Benefits business, and we think that post separation, we will have a business that has less risk associated with it, has more predictable higher free cash flow and greater growth prospects.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Erik J. Bass - Autonomous Research: Hi. Thank you. First just to clarify, is the $1 billion of investments, is that factored into your free cash flow guidance of 65% to 75% for 2017 and 2018?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Yes, it is. This is John.
Erik J. Bass - Autonomous Research: Okay. And this is maybe on the agenda for next week, but given all of the changes, can you provide an update to the guidance you'd given previously of kind of a $3 billion GAAP present value charge over time for low interest rates? And how much of that pertains to the business segments that are remaining with Met?
John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.: Next week.
Erik J. Bass - Autonomous Research: Okay. And just finally one question for Japan. You've seen obviously a lot of increase in sales in U.S. dollar-denominated products both for you and I think the domestic companies are also beginning to offer or emphasize these products more as well. Can you just talk quick about competition there?
Christopher G. Townsend - MetLife, Inc.: There are two types of foreign currency products. One is regular premium, one is single premium. We are one of any three carriers at the moment offering regular premium products, which is much harder to manage and there's about seven or eight offering the single premium products, which is easier to facilitate. So we think we've got a good competitive position there. We've been offering these products since the late 1990s and we've got pretty good scale, so we feel we are well placed, but as you see, others will come into this market as the economics around the yen whole life products diminish.
Erik J. Bass - Autonomous Research: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions.
John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.: Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results, and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.
John A. Hall - Head-Investor Relations: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2016 earnings call. On this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and on our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $0.83. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.27 per share, which compares to $1.51 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. Two reserve actions account for much of the operating earnings pressure: $161 million relating to our variable annuity actuarial assumption review and $257 million from modeling improvements in the reserving process, mostly for our book of universal life policies with secondary guarantees. Compared to a year ago, foreign currency, equity markets and interest rates were all headwinds in the quarter. As previously announced, we accelerated the VA policyholder behavior assumption review to the second quarter in light of our plan to separate a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. In addition, we completed our VA economic assumption review. The balance of our annual assumption reviews will take place in the third quarter as usual. Following these reviews, we have strengthened our VA reserves on a GAAP basis to reflect changes in our lapse in benefit utilization assumptions, resulting in the after-tax non-cash charge of $2 billion. This action clearly had a large impact on our reported GAAP net income of $64 million in the quarter. The reserve strengthening consists of several elements and is associated with our GMIB product. Adverse behavior changes include lower lapses, lower elective annuitization, and higher systematic withdrawals, resulting in increased annuitization under no-lapse guarantees and increased utilization of enhanced death benefits. With a 10-year deferral period required to exercise many of the riders in our GMIB product, it was only in the past year that we accumulated sufficient credible data to update our underlying behavior assumptions. This process was further supported by an independent industry study released in the second quarter of this year. Following these changes, a greater portion of our VA liabilities follow a fair value-based GAAP reserve methodology. Prior to the assumption review, more of our VA liabilities were subject to an insurance accounting model which follows an accrual-based GAAP reserve methodology. In his comments, John Hele will discuss the assumption review process results in greater detail. As I mentioned, we also adjusted reserves in the quarter to reflect modeling improvements and other refinements. The largest impact, $201 million of a $257 million of reserve strengthening, was for our book of universal life policies with secondary guarantees where we refined the calculation of excess death benefit reserves based on a more granular approach to projecting policyholder premium payments. Turning to investment performance, variable investment income totaled $285 million in the quarter which is below our run rate quarterly guidance. Private equity and hedge fund returns were both below plan. Given the performance year-to-date, it is likely that full year VII will fall below the $1.2 billion low-end of our guidance range. One of the most significant geopolitical developments in the quarter was the decision by British voters to exit the European Union. Operationally, MetLife's hub in Dublin largely insulates us from passporting issues. From an investment perspective, our U.K. exposure is limited to $17 billion with nearly all of those assets currency-matched with liabilities. Strategically, MetLife remains committed to the U.K. as an attractive long-term market. More troubling is the referendum's residual impact, mainly a global flight to safety that has put further downward pressure on interest rates with the 10-year Treasury yield near record lows. In our view, lower for longer is not going away anytime soon, and life insurance companies will need to adapt to the low rate environment. Turning to strategy, MetLife's accelerating value initiative combined with macroeconomic factors led us to pursue a plan to separate a substantial portion of U.S. Retail business. We continue to believe the separation will allow U.S. Retail to compete more effectively while enabling MetLife to generate a higher free cash flow ratio with less volatility and lower capital intensity. We are working diligently on the separation plan with full engagement from our advisors and internal team. To that end, we have achieved several important milestones on the path to separation during the quarter. We announced the rebranding of the U.S. Retail business as Brighthouse Financial, we made key management appointments, we sharpened Brighthouse's business strategy, and we completed the variable annuity assumption review ahead of schedule which provides key information to help establish Brighthouse's financial foundation. We expect to file an S-1 or Form 10 shortly after our September 27 board of directors meeting. We believe a properly executed separation will create value for our shareholders whether through an IPO, a spin or some combination thereof. This involves putting together the right strategy, structure, capital and people. Once we have certainty regarding the capital requirements in final execution plan for the separation, we will return our focus to deploying excess capital. The ultimate timing and form of the separation will be determined by a number of factors, including the capital markets environment. Turning to regulatory matters, I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal of the U.S. District Court decision rescinding our designation as a systemically important financial institution. On June 16, the government filed its opening brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Amicus briefs in support of the government's position were filed on June 23. MetLife's brief will be filed with the court on August 15, and amicus briefs in support of our position are due by August 22. The government's deadline for filing its final reply brief is September 9. The clerk of the Circuit Court has discretion to set the time for oral argument for any date after September 9. In the ordinary course, oral argument would be scheduled to take place two months to four months after the filing of the final brief, and a three-judge panel would be announced approximately 30 days prior to the date for oral argument. However, the government has requested expedited treatment of the appeal. At this time, we have no indication as to when the oral argument will be scheduled. A final decision in the case is likely to follow within a few months of oral argument. Throughout this process, MetLife will vigorously defend the U.S. District Court carefully reasoned decision. I would like to conclude this morning with an update on our ongoing focus on expenses, which I discuss in our Q1 earnings call. As a reminder, I said our goal was to ensure that even on a separated basis, MetLife would have a lower cost structure than it has in a combined basis today. As a result, we are announcing that MetLife is targeting $1 billion in pre-tax run rate expense savings by the end of 2019. This amount is well in excess of approximately $200 million of stranded overhead resulting from our planned separation and will improve the company's overall unit costs. An example of the kind of initiative that would drive these savings is our recent agreement with CSC, a leading provider of managed services to Fortune 500 companies, to administer nearly 7 million MetLife closed block life and annuity contracts. Our new expense target comes on top of the $1 billion in gross pre-tax expense saves that we announced as part of our 2012 strategy and achieved in 2015. On a net basis, our 2012 initiative generated $600 million in pre-tax savings, which has helped bring down our operating expense ratio over the past four years. However, in light of the significant headwinds our industry is facing, MetLife must do even more to avoid simply running in place. With these actions, we expect to reduce MetLife's expenses by 11%. We know this will require us to reduce head count, which is never an easy step for an organization to take. Our overall goal is to be more efficient so that we can better serve our customers and provide a fair return to shareholders. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in greater detail.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our second quarter results, including a discussion of our annual variable annuity assumption review, insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. Operating earnings in the second quarter were $924 million, or $0.83 per share. This quarter included five notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement, or QFS. First, reserve adjustments, primarily resulting from modeling improvements in the reserving process for our book of universal life with secondary guarantees, decreased operating earnings by $257 million or $0.23 per share after tax. The largest component of this adjustment was in Retail Life and Other. The new universal life model is a policy-by-policy projection of premiums and death claims, resulting in an immediate increase in future policy benefit reserves and a decrease in projected earnings. The immediate impact was a reserve increase of $201 million after tax and an ongoing higher projected reserve increases of approximately $10 million per quarter after tax. Second, the annual Retail variable annuity assumption review decreased operating earnings by $161 million or $0.15 per share after tax. I will discuss the results of the assumption review in more detail shortly. Third, an adjustment to reinsurance receivables in Australia decreased operating earnings by $44 million or $0.04 per share after tax. Fourth, we had unfavorable catastrophe experience which decreased operating earnings by $15 million or $0.01 per share after tax. Finally, variable investment income was below the 2016 quarterly plan range by $9 million or $0.01 per share after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs. Turning to bottom line results, second quarter net income was $64 million or $0.06 per share. Net income was $860 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses of $1.5 billion driven by the non-cash charge resulting from the annual variable annuity assumption review. This was partially offset by derivative gains of $725 million, primarily related to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies. In addition, there was $330 million in after-tax derivative gains resulting from other variable annuity derivatives and hedging. The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $1.8 billion after tax related to asymmetrical and non-economic accounting. Book value per share excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $53.20 as of June 30, up 5% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $43.98 as of June 30, also up 5% year-over-year. Now let me discuss the results of the Retail variable annuity assumption review, which we accelerated in connection with the planned separation. As a result of this review, we made changes to policyholder behavior and economic assumptions, as well as the risk margin for the Retail variable annuity block of business. Given a 10-year waiting period for the exercise of certain options within our GMIB products, we have only recently begun to observe sufficient and credible evidence to support a shift in our underlying future behavior assumptions for key blocks of this business. Our study consisted of our own emerging experience, combined with recently available relevant industry data. As a result, we have strengthened our VA reserves, resulting in an after-tax GAAP charge of $2 billion to net income, including an after-tax GAAP charge to operating earnings of $161 million. This non-cash charge consists of three significant components. First, changes in four policyholder behavior assumptions for the guaranteed riders of GMIBs to reflect current company and industry experience. One, we lowered the percentage of policyholders who elect to receive a fixed income annuity under their GMIB rider. Two, we lowered the percentage of policyholders who elect reimbursement of the initial premiums paid when that amount exceeds their current account balance. Three, we increase the percentage of policyholders who elect dollar-for-dollar withdrawals, particularly those in qualified plans at higher ages. And four, we lowered the ultimate lapse rate on certain contracts. Where material, we have differentiated these adjustments between Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and our Delaware company, ML USA. A combination of these changes resulted in a partial shift in accounting for these guarantees from mainly an insurance accrual-based model to a more embedded derivatives under a fair value model, resulting in an after-tax charge of $1.5 billion to net income. Second, changes in economic assumptions resulted in an after-tax charge of $279 million. These changes included reducing the long-term separate account return assumption for variable contracts with traditional mutual funds from 7.25% to 7.0%, and managed volatility funds from 7.0% to 6.75%. We also reduced the projected ultimate 10-year Treasury rate from 4.5% to 4.25%, which is reached in 2027. Third, the updates resulted in an after-tax charge of $222 million related to the risk margin required in reserves subject to fair value accounting. Let me explain the accounting a little more. GAAP accounting for living benefits is split between accrual and fair value accounting rules. If policyholders elect to annuitize or they die, then this risk is measured under an insurance accounting model, which uses an accrual method reflecting best estimate assumptions. At MetLife, we assume 10-year U.S. Treasury interest rates start at June 30, 2016 levels and increase to 4.25% by 2027, and that long-term separate account returns are 6.75% to 7.0%. However, when policyholders elect dollar-for-dollar withdrawals and exhaust their account values, they receive fixed income annuities. The guaranteed pay-off portions of those annuities, usually for 5 years to 10 years, are considered embedded derivatives and are measured at fair value. The portion beyond the guaranteed period is measured using the insurance accounting model. Under fair value accounting, the interest rates used for discounted and separate account returns, including equity fund returns, are calculated actuarially but on average are set to current market rates. For example, at June 30, 2016, the 10-year swap rate was 1.36%. That means that all liabilities are discounted at 1.36% and all separate account assets are assumed to grow at 1.36% before fees. Now contrast this, the modest impact on statutory reserves. Using the same change to policyholder behavior assumptions, the statutory impact is a reduction in reserves of $266 million after tax. The majority of our statutory reserves are calculated using a series of actuarial methods and also assume that the yield curve as of June 30, 2016 slowly rises based on a mean reversion to a level approximately consistent with the long-term 10-year Treasury interest rate of 4.25% in 2027, and an equity return assumption of 7.5%. As you can see, under either accounting system, the ultimate cost of these guarantees will be based on owning a policyholder behavior but on future economic conditions. With respect to second quarter margins, total company underwriting was unfavorable by approximately $0.08 per share versus the prior year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Retail Life and Property & Casualty were the primary drivers of the less favorable experience this quarter. Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 56.7% after adjusting 21.3 points for the notable reserve adjustment discussed earlier. This was unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 53.0% and modestly above the top end of the annual target range of 51% to 56%. The year-over-year shortfall was driven by higher frequency and severity of claims. In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 108.9% in Retail and 103.1% in Group. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 86.9% in Retail and 92.5% in Group. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was above the prior year quarter of 80.2% in Retail and 85.5% in Group. We experienced higher catastrophe losses in our homeowners business through the hail and windstorms in the Midwest. Elevated non-cat losses in auto were due to higher frequency and severity. We continue to take pricing and underwriting actions in auto. We believe these actions will yield improved results in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and will bring results in line with our target combined ratios over the course of 2017. Underwriting results in Group Life and Non-Medical Health were generally in line with the prior year quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.7%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 86.1% and the low end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced lower claim severity versus the prior year quarter. The Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio was 80.7%, modestly unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 80.5% and within the annual target range of 77% to 82%. Turning to investment margins, the simple average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 190 basis points in the quarter, down 37 basis points year-over-year. Lower variable investment income accounted for 16 basis points of this decline. Pre-tax variable investment income, or VII, was $285 million, down $142 million versus the prior year quarter, mostly due to lower returns on alternative investments. Product spreads excluding VII were 166 basis points this quarter, down 21 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 22.7%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.3%. The lower operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to lower employee benefits, expense efficiencies and the timing of certain projects. I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $184 million, down 73% versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the reserve adjustments discussed earlier. Excluding these and all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were down 17% due to unfavorable underwriting and lower investment margins. Retail's operating premium fees and other revenues, or PFOs, were $3.1 billion, down 6% year-over-year primarily due to annuities. Annuities PFOs were $1.1 billion, down 12% year-over-year due to lower fees as a result of negative fund flows and lower premiums due to a decline in SPIA sales. Retail sales were down 21% year-over-year, primarily due to lower variable annuity sales. VA sales were down 39% year-over-year, primarily due to the sales suspension by a major distributor this year. Conversely, we continue to see strong growth from Shield Level Selector, which more than doubled its sales year-over-year. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, reported operating earnings of $221 million, down 4% versus the prior year quarter but essentially flat adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were higher auto claims and lower investment margins, mostly offset by volume growth. GVWB PFOs were $4.6 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Sales were up 25% year-over-year with growth in most group and voluntary products as well as across most markets. Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, reported operated earnings of $302 million, down 26% versus the prior year quarter, and down 18% after adjusting for notable items. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $650 million, up 43% year-over-year due to higher pension risk transfers, or PRT. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities. Latin America reported operated earnings of $128 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter and up 36% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin America operating earnings were up 40% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth, lower expenses and improved underwriting margins. U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $9 million versus a $20 million loss in the prior quarter was reflecting volume growth and lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $994 million, down 9%, but up 4% on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct and adjusting for SPIA sales in Chile, which tend to be uneven, Latin America PFOs grew 7% on a constant currency basis. Total Latin America sales were up 29% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct, Latin America sales were up 47% on a constant currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by a large group employee benefit sale in Mexico, as well as growth in most markets. Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $259 million, down 39% from the prior year quarter and 17% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were higher taxes and lower fixed annuity surrenders in Japan, partially offset by high investment margins and volume growth. Asia PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 8% from the prior year quarter and 13% on a constant currency basis. I would highlight two items that negatively impacted Asia PFOs this quarter. First, the deconsolidation of our India operations beginning in 2016 dampened growth by two points year-over-year. And second, the withdrawal in Japan of single premium and A&H Yen products in 2015 reduced growth by six points year-over-year. As noted previously, these products do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment. Excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of the India operations and the withdrawal in Japan of single premium A&H Yen products, PFOs were down 5% on a constant currency basis. The key driver for this decline is a shift from premium-based products to higher-value, fee-based products. Asia sales were down 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 13% year-over-year. We have seen a successful shift in sales to higher return foreign currency denominated life product, which were up 65% year-over-year, and away from low return Yen life products, which were down 54% year-over-year. Japan's Third Sector sales were down 31% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single premium A&H and the negative impact on packaged sales from a reduction in yen-denominated Whole Life product sales. Sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 19% versus the prior year. EMEA operating earnings were $64 million, up 28% year-over-year and 36% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were lower expenses and volume growth. EMEA PFOs were $633 million, down 4% from the prior year period but at 1% on a constant currency basis. Excluding certain one-time items, PFOs were up 3% on a constant currency basis. Top-line performance was in line with expectations, and we continue to see a favorable shift towards high-margin products. Total EMEA sales increased 10% on a constant currency basis, mainly driven by growth in employee benefits and accident and health policy. In connection with separation, starting in 3Q, we will reflect the U.S. Retail business, now known as Brighthouse Financial, in a standalone operating segment. This will occur in concert with the re-segmentation of the business units that will form the remaining business of MetLife. Among other changes, we will reorganize and report our auto and home insurance business as a single separate segment known as Property & Casualty. We will have full details on the re-segmentation and re-formatted financials to you prior to reporting our third quarter earnings. A financial reporting impact of the re-segmentation will be a GAAP charge to operating earnings in the third quarter of less than $300 million after tax. To reflect the loss of the aggregation benefit for GAAP-reserve testing associated with the variable and universal life business, Brighthouse Financial will be reported in a standalone operating segment that will no longer receive credit for the broader diversification of the consolidated U.S. Retail universal life business of MetLife. As a result, projected earnings for variable and universal life business within the new Brighthouse Financial segment will be adversely affected. Further details will be provided with the third quarter results. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.9 billion at June 30, which is down from $5.3 billion at March 31. This amount reflects a senior debt repayment upon maturity of $1.25 billion, as well as regular cash flows, including subsidiary dividends, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses. We did not refinance the maturing debt in the second quarter as we prepare for the ultimate separation of Brighthouse Financial. Turning to our capital position, we report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the second quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 870% as of the first quarter of 2016, which is the latest public data. For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date second quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.3 billion, and net earnings were approximately $500 million. Statutory operating earnings were down 39% from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates and reserves, largely variable annuities, and lower net investment income. In addition, lower fees earned on separate account balances contributed to the decline in operating earnings. Under statutory accounting, most of the impact of hedging is not reported in operating earnings or net income, rather the gain is recorded in statutory capital. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $31 billion as of June 30, up 6% from December 31, primarily from an increase in unrealized gains on derivatives of $3.5 billion. In conclusion, we recognize financial results well below expectations this quarter. Challenging market factors, as well as updates to our reserves, all contributed to this performance; however, we remain confident the steps we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. I had a couple of questions related both to the charge and the VA business. So first, how does the charge affect your view of capital? I realize it's a GAAP charge, not a staff charge, and it basically had a positive, but how does it affect your view of your capital? And then secondly, how does the charge affect just your view of the earnings power of the annuity business? If you think about earnings in the last three years, I think they have been pretty consistent on an annual basis, between $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, and the size of the charge relative to earnings is pretty large. But how do you think about the earnings power of the annuity business, given this charge?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Jimmy. This is John. In terms of the statutory reserves, you saw there was a small release. Statutory capital, which is at CT90, has a slightly smaller change, but that – the companies have good RBCs right now for that. I'd like to just caution that changes to statutory reserves are not the true determinant of overall capital. There's a variety of factors and looking forward, when Brighthouse is separated, it'll be a standalone company, not part of a broader diversified MetLife. So those will have to be – as we file our S-1 or Form 10, you'll see more details as to the capitalization of Brighthouse as a standalone company. In terms of the earnings power, the earnings power is operating earnings and those are based on the fees of the base benefits. And we see fees sort of leveling off a bit here. You saw us report on the statutory that the VA fees are sort of leveling off because the total balances we're seeing some negative flows. So I think you'll see that staying more steady going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. John, wanted to dig into the charge a little bit more. And it sounds to me like at a high level, that the charge could be split between partial what's an assumption review, but also moving from this accounting standard of the insurance SOP 03-1, so the embedded derivative convention. So if we try to bifurcate that $1.5 billion of policyholder charges between what's assumption changes and what's a change in the accounting standard, can you help us think how we would split that?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's a great question, but it's very difficult to do because we have changed several assumptions, so if you lower annuitization which we did and increase dollar-for-dollar, that's assumption of what people are doing, but then the accounting changes it as well. And so it's interrelations between all these the actuaries, call it, the cross effect and it's a pretty big number. So if I give you one piece but there's a big cross effect in how they all add up and we can't reattribute the cross effect to it. So it's a little misleading to just look at one piece of it. They're all interrelated as you do all of these, and so in the end, it's really the total number that we have to communicate.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then maybe just...
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: But you can see the increase to the FAS 133 reserves. It's a significant increase and it's most of that $1.5 billion.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And just maybe back into the economics of it all. You gave four points as to what the policyholder behavior assumption changes were, and it just seemed, I guess, taking the simplified view, that if you increase the dollar-for-dollar utilization, that tends to be bad news for a charge, and conversely, if you increase the annuitization uptake, that tends to be positive to the business. I'm not sure if I'm reading that correctly, but I guess my question is two-fold there. Is that correct, do I have the right read on that, and why is that the case?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, we lowered the number that take annuitizations based on our experience and increased – particularly at older ages, we're seeing more people taking dollar-for-dollar, and in particular in qualified plans. Now, how these things interact with each other depend upon the future fund performance and where interest rates are. So you could see under GAAP, which for dollar-for-dollar used the fair value accounting which assumes much lower returns for separate accounts and interest rates. There's a cost to that. Whereas in statutory, which assumes a mean reversion of interest rates and separate our account returns that are reflecting equity markets that are in, say and call it, more normal, is actually a decrease in reserve. So there's a switch-over point here between what happens to economic assumptions between the ultimate costs of these. And why is that? Well, the dollar-for-dollar becomes a cost if you run out of money in your account and then you trigger the guarantee. If you have okay investment performance, you may not trigger the guarantee. You'll have enough money in your account for a long period of time. If your separate accounts are earning 1.36%, you're going to run out of money and you have more people triggering the guarantees. So it's a combination of these two. And where all this ends up will likely be some place in between these. So it'll depend upon what policyholders do as well as what equity markets are and what interest rates are.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you and good morning. On the third quarter actuarial assumption review, do you have any perspective in terms of the potential magnitude of that impact?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We did accelerate not only the policyholder behavior review, but also the economic assumption review, and the risk margin review for the VA business, which is a very large book-of-business relative to the total risk profile of MetLife. The other reviews that we do every year on mortality and morbidity and the other blocks of business will just have to wait until we get there. But if you look back over MetLife's history, those tend to be more modest.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful. Thanks, John. Also, based on the timing of the filing of the S-1 or Form 10 for Brighthouse, should we be expecting any share buybacks in 2016?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: As I mentioned in my remarks – it's Steve here – our first order of business is to work on the separation and make sure we have a clear understanding about capitalization of Brighthouse, the form of the separation. Once we get through that, we will focus on the issue of how we'll use any remaining excess capital. So we are not at that point yet, where we can really speak to when share repurchases may begin.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I appreciate that, Steve. Post the transaction, would you still anticipate that Met can meet its targeted goals of return of capital as a percentage of earnings?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Our philosophy hasn't changed. Our accelerating value initiative is based upon driving up, among other things, the ratio of free cash flow to total operating earnings, and we think this separation plan, as well as expense initiative that we just announced, goes to that as well. And we've also said philosophically many times that excess capital belongs to our shareholders, that's in the form of dividends, share repurchases and any acquisitions that make strategic sense that are accretive to shareholders over time.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Good morning. My first question is, just thinking about the third quarter review. John, you had already mentioned the $300 million separation-related charge due to lack of a diversification benefit. But as you think about anything else or areas to watch out for, can you highlight any particular areas, whether that's goodwill or DAC that we should be focused on, where the review will come under more scrutiny in 3Q?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, there will be two things going on in the third quarter just to clarify. There will be our annual assumption review for other than variable annuities and then there's the re-segmentation. And both can have an impact, as I've said historically, MetLife other than for variability annuities, the assumption review has been more modest. And the re-segmentation we've highlighted for you what we've seen already in terms of the re-segmentation of the diversification for universal life and variable life not having the diversification credit across all of MetLife. And we will be checking our goodwill in the third quarter, but I can't give you any insight into that until we get all that work done.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Okay. And then the follow-up is you'd mentioned after the re-segmentation occurs, there's going to be an adverse effect. You mentioned the charge, but is there also going to be an ongoing adverse effect on the operating results? Is there going to be a lower level of operating earnings from the variable annuity business and the life insurance business, and how should we think about that?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, I did say that we expect there could be some ongoing impacts, but we won't be able to clarify that for you until we get to the third quarter.
Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First, on the cost saves, the $1 billion gross amount, are there any reinvestment assumptions that would net to a lower amount, other than the $200 million of stranded overhead?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. Ryan, there will be investments. We are still working out the details of those and as we develop our plans in more detail, we'll share with you really the net impacts. By the time we get to 2019, we expect almost all that to be falling through to the bottom line. But there will be investments. We did the $1 billion saves in 2012 and there was a lot of reorganizing that this next set will be really quite a structural and an investment in processing and efficiencies such as you saw the CSC announcement that we did. So this next $1 billion will take some investment to get the long-term cost saves but we do plan to have this flow through to the bottom line end of 2019 run rate, which will be 2020 going forward.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, got it. And then on corporate segment, I guess, you're at $411 million of year-to-date losses, which is higher than the $500 million to $700 million full year expectation you had. Can you give us any update on how to think about the corporate setting going to the second half of the year?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, so this quarter was higher. We had lower VII which impacted it, just happened to be the assets that were there. The alternative investments were lower. And then taxes had an impact in the quarter there. Corporate is used to level out taxes for the year and we had to take a charge to level out the tax rate for the year. So those are more one-time.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please go ahead.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Just wanted to follow up on the expense savings of $1 billion. How should we think about that splitting between the separated company and old MetLife?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: This will all be for RemainCo.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, got it. And then as we think, I guess for Steve, about the ROE of the company, I know there's lots of moving pieces, but by our calculation, you're somewhere in the 9%, maybe 9.5% range on a normalized basis, and I think in the past, you've talked about 11% as a target. I guess I'm just trying to understand what kept us from 9% and change up to 11% in this low interest rate environment?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Suneet, the things you've heard about over the last couple quarters, including the separation of the U.S. Retail business, as well as the expense initiative that we just announced, are all related to driving that ROE number back up to a range that we like to see it at.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: And is that range still around 11% or...
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we'll talk to you more about ranges at Investor Day in December.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks very much. John, would you just remind us briefly all the choices that customers have at the end of the waiting period for the GMIB? You mentioned, of course, that they can annuitize at the end of the waiting period. But under your most popular contract forms that you've written over the years, what are the other paths that a customer could take, besides annuitization?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. So, although it does vary by contract, the GMIB has, after a 10-year waiting period, the ability to take your balance and get an annuity to be paid for life, based on your benefit base, not on your account balance. And you get the greater of current annuity rates or guarantees of annuity rates that do have a setback in. And that's with a benefit base or your current account balance at current annuity rates. But you can also then, for many of the contracts, not take that option and instead elect dollar-for-dollar, which is almost like a WB benefit for life. And if you run out of your dollar-for-dollar money by taking up to your percentage allowed, if your account balance is zero, then you get an annuity for life. So that almost gives you the same thing, and we're seeing less people take annuitization options and more people elect dollar-for-dollar, particularly as they age and more in qualified plans. There's another feature that I spoke about that allows sort of a refund of your initial premiums paid, the first, I think, 120 days. We call it the (52:39) principal option. You can surrender your rider and get this top-off of money to be your premiums paid, but you lose then your other benefits of the other rider features for it. And then, you can always surrender your contract for cash at any time. There's no waiting period, but you have a surrender charge for the first typically five years to seven years, depending upon the contract.
Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And I have one second and final question regarding universal life. I'm trying to understand better than I do why this matter of looking at things on a policy-by-policy basis would lead to a reserve increase in universal life. And the reason I ask the question is, life insurance companies are always dealing with groups of policies, cohorts, averages. There's no reason to think that using an averaging method, rather than a policy-by-policy approach, would lead to a bias of overstatement or understatement. So why is, if you follow my question, it is – why is going with a – I understand that going with a policy-by-policy approach is more precise than using an average, but why would it necessarily lead to – why didn't the average work, and why did it lead, in other words, to a reserve deficiency, this averaging approach?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Within the cohorts that were being modeled before, there was a much wider variation than the average within the cohort. So, although there was an average amount of premiums paid within a group, there was a much bigger percentage of people paying the minimum, versus people paying a higher amount. And so we were underestimating the number of policyholders that will trigger the guarantees, and then trigger them sooner. So it's just a wider dispersion. But if you're going policy-by-policy, it came out to be a more precise calculation than the average way that was being done previously.
Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: I got it. Thanks very much.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: In terms of – to put the charge into perspective, the universal life piece of the charge, the $257 million was about $200 million, and that's about 1.6% of the total reserves for universal life with (54:53) guarantees. It's about $12.5 billion. So it is a true-up of reserves. It's a better method to calculate it, which we do from time to time. But in terms of perspective, it's not that material of a change.
Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR. Please go ahead.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Thanks. Actually, just two questions, one follow-up there, with Eric's question. Are there any other major blocks that need to be migrated to these more granular systems? This is in regard to the SGOL, just wondering if we might see similar reserve charges, if you continue this, what I think is a technology migration.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. This is one of the biggest and most complex areas. And of course, lower interest rates has made this a larger reserve needed as universal life with lifetime secondary guarantees. Lower rates have made these contracts to be more valuable to their customers and therefore, we've had to increase the reserves on them.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Great. And then back to the main VA charge, I'm just trying to think, at a higher level, it seems like, once people exhaust their separate account, you have a cliff effect where the swap rate becomes your discount rate, rather than the mean reversion assumptions under STAT. And I think I'm saying that right, but if that is the case, then can you size what percentage of people you think in that overall VA block were going to continue to monitor at Brighthouse are expected to exhaust their separate account, and therefore be exposed to the 10-year swap as a discount rate?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right. Well, we're seeing less people annuitize. If you annuitize, you don't pick dollar-for-dollar. So less people annuitize, more people pick dollar-for-dollar. But the actual calculations are highly complex. We run tens of thousands of runs over a wide range of scenarios. So when you talk about these interest rates, these are the average interest rates, both even in STAT and GAAP. It's just the mean of those interest rates in STAT reverts to roughly this 4.25% in 2027, whereas the GAAP piece, if you pick dollar-for-dollar, a piece of your risk, the guaranteed piece, the certain period of your annuity, has to be reserved under GAAP using like a mean reversion interest rate of 1.36%.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Right.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's a very wide difference, including a separate account returns. I want to stress, that's a separate account return before fees. So you're generally having negative returns in your separate accounts. You can see how that can have a high cost to this. If interest rates migrate higher, and you have to mark this every quarter to the current yield curve. As interest rates go up, this charge becomes less as you go through time. So I actually wanted to give you the wide range of the changes because what the ultimate cost of these things will be will depend on interest rates and what policyholders do. I would also like to stress, this is over a long period of time. Our average age of these contracts is in the 60s and people elect these options well into their 80s and higher. So these are long-term contracts and how this works out over time will be the ultimate cost, but we do match this to our experience and we do it on a regular basis as we get credible experience. And we now have a new industry study that we just got that had some good credible experience for GMIBs, and that's why we set our reserves appropriately.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Thank you.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results, and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factor section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Edward A. Spehar - Head-Investor Relations: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome MetLife's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Last night we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.20, which compares to $1.44 per share in the first quarter 2015. The negative impact from market factors more than offset a benefit from volume growth. The combination of weak equity markets for most of the quarter, continued strength in the U.S. dollar, and low interest rates reduced operating earnings by $0.16 per share versus the prior-year period. In addition, variable investment income, or VII, declined by $0.12 per share. Variable investment income can be volatile, largely because it is driven by the performance of alternative asset classes. We believe some earnings variability is an acceptable risk as these asset classes have provided strong returns to MetLife shareholders over time. To illustrate, VII was better than planned in seven of the past 10 years with the cumulative positive variance of $505 million after tax. This favorable performance to plan is noteworthy given that the time period includes the financial crisis. Despite the sluggish global economy, we estimate overall volume growth was 3% year-over-year, driven by 11% growth in our non-U.S. businesses. In addition, the value generated from new business written has improved as a result of our accelerating value strategic initiative. For example, in Japan, our second-largest market, foreign currency-denominated product sales were up more than 50% in the first quarter. We are focused on growth in this area because none-yen products have very attractive cash return characteristics. In contrast, yen Whole Life sales were down 60% in the quarter. This sales decline was intentional as it is difficult for this product to generate attractive returns and acceptable cash payback periods in a negative interest rate environment. Overall, top-line growth is a challenge in the current low-rate environment. However, as I often tell my team, external factors are beyond our control, so we must focus on what we can control. In this instance, to combat the pressures of growth from low rates in a weak macroeconomic environment, we must address our cost structure. It is critical that we achieve a sustained reduction in unit costs and our top priority is addressing elevated overhead expenses that will result from the separation of the U.S. retail business. It is too early to provide specifics on expense reduction, but we believe that the separated business and the remaining company combined will have a lower cost base than MetLife does today. Now, I would like to provide an update on regulatory matters. On March 30, Judge Rosemary Collyer of the U.S. district court from the District of Columbia rescinded MetLife's designation as a systemically important financial institution or SIFI. In a carefully reasoned decision, Judge Collyer found that the Financial Stability Oversight Council's designation of MetLife was arbitrary and capricious. Her ruling said that FSOC had failed to: one, conduct a vulnerability assessment of MetLife as required by FSOC's own regulations and guidance; two, adhere to any discernible standard in determining that material financial distress at MetLife could threaten U.S. financial stability; and three, consider the consequences and cost of designation as required by Supreme Court precedent. None of these is purely a procedural matter. For example, the judge noted that FSOC defined a threat to financial stability as one that would "sufficiently be severe to inflict significant damage on the broader economy." Yet rather than applying its own standard, the judge found that FSOC "hardly adhere to any standard when it came to assessing MetLife's threat to U.S. financial stability." She said she could not uphold the finding that MetLife's distress would damage the broader economy when "FSOC refused to undertake that analysis itself." On April 8, FSOC appealed the judge's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit. In MetLife's initial legal complaint filed last year, we offered 10 reasons, or counts, as to why our SIFI designation should be lifted. Judge Collyer ruled in favor of MetLife on three of those 10 counts. She rejected our argument on one count, the technical question of whether MetLife qualifies as a U.S. nonbank financial company. She did not rule on the other six counts, including those based on constitutional grounds. On appeal, all 10 counts may be brought before the D.C. circuit. Some of the commentary on our SIFI case has portrayed it as an effort to undermine the Dodd-Frank Act. We strongly disagree with this characterization. The right to seek judicial review of an FSOC designation is part of the Dodd-Frank Act itself as enacted by Congress. In seeking judicial review of FSOC's designation of MetLife, we are upholding the process established by Dodd-Frank, not undermining it. Let me be clear. MetLife supports prudent regulation of the U.S. life insurance industry. We make long-term promises and consumer confidence depends on the ability of the life insurance industry to honor its commitments. In MetLife's case, we have been keeping our promises since 1868 through wars, boom times, panics, and recessions. It's worth remembering that we came through the 2008 financial crisis in such strong shape that in 2010 we're able to buy Alico from AIG for $16 billion, money that AIG used to help repay U.S. taxpayers. One of the questions we have received most frequently since Judge Collyer's decision is whether we still plan to pursue the separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. retail business. The answer is yes. As we explained when we announced the planned separation in January, the decision was driven by both strategic and regulatory factors. Strategically, the imperative of cash generation is stronger than ever, especially in light of a lower for longer interest rate environment. And from a regulatory perspective, while we are pleased that our SIFI status has been rescinded, FSOC could attempt to re-designate MetLife at a later date. We are keeping open our options with regard to what form a separation could take, including an initial public offering, a spinoff or a sale. To prepare for the possibility of a separation in the form of a public offering, we expect to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission sometime this summer. Regardless of the form, the separated business will be leaner and more focused. With the sale of the MetLife Premier Client Group to MassMutual, U.S. retail will be only a manufacturer of annuity and life insurance products, not a distributor. As I noted in my annual letter to shareholders last week, the expense of the advisor force was preventing us from clearing MetLife's hurdle rate on much of the new business written through that channel. By exiting proprietary retail distribution in the U.S., we anticipate run rate expense savings of approximately $250 million per year after tax, which would be split about evenly between the separated business and the rest of MetLife. I am confident that MetLife is taking the right steps to generate long-term shareholder value. We are changing our product mix to adapt to the external environment. We are separating the business on which the company was founded to strengthen the amount and timing of cash generation. And we are focusing on expenses to ensure both the separated business and MetLife have a competitive cost structure. Finally this morning, I would like to discuss some changes to our finance team. As we announced in news release a short while ago, Marlene Debel, our Treasurer, is becoming CFO for the U.S. This is a much-deserved opportunity for Marlene. Mike Walsh, our CFO to the Americas, will be retiring after 28 years at MetLife. Mike has been a trusted business partner to many of us. We thank Mike for his many valuable contributions and wish him all the best in his retirement. John McCallion, who is well known to many of you as our former Head of Investor Relations, will become our new Treasurer. And Ed Spehar, our current Head of Investor Relations, will assume John's role as CFO of EMEA. I told John he has done such a good job that he gets to come home from Europe. And I told Ed he has done such a good job, he gets to go to Europe. Congratulations, Marlene, Mike, John and Ed as you embark on the next chapters of your careers and lives. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I'd also like to recognize the contribution of Marlene, John and Ed and wish them well in their new roles and thank Mike for 28 years of outstanding service to MetLife. I am very proud of my finance leadership team. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses, and business highlight. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. Operating earnings in the first quarter were $1.3 billion or $1.20 per share. This quarter included three notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement, or QFS. First, variable investment income was $109 million after DAC and taxes, which was $86 million or $0.08 per share below the bottom end of our 2016 quarterly plan range. Second, we had higher-than-expected catastrophe losses, which decreased operating earnings by $45 million or $0.04 per share after tax. Third, we had a onetime tax benefit in Japan partially offset by a tax charge in Chile, which increased operating earnings by $10 million, or $0.01 per share after tax. The tax rate in Japan decreased 60 basis points, resulting in a $20 million onetime benefit, partially offset by a $10 million charge from a 200-basis-point increase in MetLife's tax rate in Chile. Turning to our bottom-line results. First quarter net income was $2.2 billion, or $1.98 per share. Net income was $866 million, higher than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net gains driven by lower interest rates and the financial impact of converting Japan operations to calendar year reporting. Japan's results including operating earnings for the month of December 2015 were reflected below the line in order to eliminate the accounting lag. The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $824 million after tax related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting. Book value per share excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $53.31 as of March 31, up 6% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $44.17 as of March 31, up 7% year-over-year. With respect to first quarter margins, underwriting in the Americas was favorable versus the prior-year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Favorable results in Group Life, Retail Life, and Latin America were offset by less favorable results in nonmedical health, and property & casualty. Total company underwriting margins were essentially in line with the prior-year quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.9%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 90.7% and the low end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced lower claim severity versus the prior-year quarter while frequency was in line with our expectations. Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 54.8%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 59.3% and within the annual target range of 51% to 56%. The year-over-year improvement was driven by a return to more normal average net claims. As we had highlighted, 1Q 2015 had higher than normal accidental death, particularly accidental falls, which we believe were related to adverse winter weather. In Latin America, underwriting was favorable to the prior-year quarter and relative to the expectations primarily driven by lower loss ratios in Mexico. The nonmedical health interest adjusted loss ratio was 83.2%, unfavorable to a strong prior-year quarter of 77.0% and above the top end of the annual target range of 77% to 82%. The key drivers were higher seasonal utilization in dental and higher claim severity in disability as well as favorable LTC underwriting in the prior-year quarter. The first quarter is a seasonally weak quarter for dental and disability. This seasonality was not apparent in the nonmedical health interest adjusted loss ratio during the past two years, largely because dental utilization was low due to adverse winter weather. In property & casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 100.4% in Retail and 102.9% in Group. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 86.3% in Retail and 93.0% in Group. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was in line with expectations but above a strong prior-year quarter of 79.4% in Retail and 89.7% in Group. We experienced higher catastrophe losses in our homeowners business and modestly higher severity in our auto business. However, auto results strengthened this quarter, and we expect further improvement throughout 2016 as a result of rate increases. Turning to investment margins, the average of our four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 170 basis points in the quarter, down 41 basis points year-over-year. Approximately half of this climb, or 20 basis points, was the result of lower variable investment income. Pre-tax variable investment income, or VII, was $165 million, down $206 million versus the prior-year quarter mostly due to weak hedge fund performance. Our allocation to hedge fund is approximately 40 basis points of the total investment portfolio, and we plan to further reduce our exposure. Product spreads excluding variable investment income were 161 basis points this quarter, down 21 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields account for most of this decline. With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.8%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 23.5%. The higher operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily driven to the write-off of a net reinsurance receivable. I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $532 million, down 19% versus the prior-year quarter and down 11% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Life and other reported operating earnings of $172 million, down 15% versus the prior year quarter but up 7% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary driver was net favorable underwriting as life mortality rebounded from an unfavorable prior-year quarter and property & casualty non-catastrophe results returned to more normal levels. Underwriting improvement was partially offset by lower investment margins. Life and other PFOs were $2 billion, down 1% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by runoff of the closed block. Life and other sales were up 1% year-over-year as the 15% increase in P&C was mostly offset by a 5% decline in life sales, mainly in Whole Life. Whole life volumes were strong, but we sold less high-face policies versus the prior-year quarter. Annuities reported operating earnings of $360 million, down 20% versus the prior-year quarter and down 19% after adjusting for VII below plan this quarter. The key drivers were less favorable market impact, negative fund flows and higher expenses. The initial market impact reduced operating earnings by $5 million after tax, which compares to a $26 million benefit in the prior-year quarter. Total annuity sales were $2.3 billion in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum in our index-linked annuity, Shield Level Selector. Shield sales were $411 million in the quarter or triple the sales in the prior-year period and up 14%, sequentially. VA sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, essentially flat to the prior-year quarter. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $174 million, down 24% versus the prior-year quarter and down 20% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting as compared to a strong prior-year quarter and lower investment margins. GVWB PFOs were $4.6 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Sales were up 28% year-over-year with growth in Group and Voluntary products. I know that segments earnings were below consensus estimates, which I believe relates to seasonality that was not evident during the past two years. In terms of the full-year outlook for GVWB, the near-term guidance on certain key items provided on our December outlook call still applies. Corporate Benefit Funding or CBF reported operating earnings of $295 million, down 20% versus the prior-year quarter and down 12% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $508 million, down 6% year-over-year due to lower pension risk transfers or PRT. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy, but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities. Latin America reported operating earnings of $137 million, up 5% from the prior-year quarter and up 32% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin America operating earnings were up 45% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth as well as favorable investment and underwriting margins. U.S. direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $14 million versus an $18 million loss in the prior-year quarter, reflecting growth and lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $966 million, down 4%, but up 14% on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. direct PFOs, which were up 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, Latin America PFOs were up 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. Total Latin America sales were flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. direct sales, which were down 18% year-over-year, LatAm sales were up 3% on a constant currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by direct marketing, partially offset by lower Afore sales in Mexico in the current quarter, as well as the large group case sales in the prior-year quarter. Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $305 million, down 7% from the prior-year quarter and 5% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in the current quarter. Strong volume growth across the region was more than offset by lower fixed annuity surrender fees in Japan as well as higher project costs and other expenses in Japan, in the region. Asia PFOs were $2 billion, down 7% from the prior-year quarter on both the reported and constant currency basis. There are two factors that reduce Asia PFOs this quarter. First, as a result of a regulatory change, we are now required to use the equity method of accounting for the 26% ownership interest in our India joint venture. As a result, beginning in 1Q 2016, we are no longer reporting 100% of India PFOs and Asia PFOs. Instead, the financial results of our 26% interest will be reflected as net investment income in Asia. This accounting changes consistent with the treatment of MetLife's other joint ventures in Asia, which include China, Malaysia, and Vietnam. In addition, Asia PFOs were negatively impacted by the withdrawal of single premium A&H yen products in Japan. As previously noted, these products do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment. Excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of our India operation and the withdrawal in Japan of single premium A&H yen product, PFOs were up 2% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were down 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value creation and growth in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 1% year-over-year. We have seen a successful shift in sales to high-return foreign currency-denominated life products, which were up 53% year-over-year, and away from low-return yen life product, which were down 35% year-over-year. Japan third sector sales were down 29% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single premium A&H and the negative impact on packet sales from a reduction in yen-denominated Whole Life products. EMEA operating earnings were $63 million, down 10% year-over-year and down 3% on a constant currency basis. Earnings in the prior-year quarter benefited from favorable underwriting margins and lower expenses. Underlying volume growth in the first quarter of 2016 is consistent with our near-term outlook of high teens on a constant currency basis. EMEA PFOs were $615 million, down 1% from the prior-year period but up 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the Middle East and the U.K. Total EMEA sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis and 7% after adjusting for the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year. The 7% growth was driven by employee benefit sales in the Middle East and accident health products across the region. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, down from $6.4 billion at December 31. This amount reflects the capital contribution of $1.5 billion to MetLife Insurance Company USA in contemplation of the proposed separation as well as regular cash flows, including subsidiary dividends, payment of our quarterly common dividend, and other holding company expenses. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Our combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding Alico, was 513% on a reported basis and 537% on an NAIC basis at year-end 2015. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 936% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings and net earnings were approximately $700 million. Statutory operating earnings were down 38% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to low interest rates. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of March 31, up 1% from December 31. In conclusion, first quarter operating earnings were below expectations, primarily due to market factors. While the current environment remains challenging, we are confident that our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. The first question is, I guess, can you give us some sense at least based on what your legal representation might be advising you as to the timing around this appeal process?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, John. It's Steve.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Good morning, Steve.
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning. Yes, the Justice Department filed their appeal nine days after the original decision came down from the District Court, and we anticipate that the ministerial paperwork will be filed by June 6. That's what the court has requested, the Circuit Court, and then there'll be a briefing schedule at that point in time which, we think concludes sometime in the fall time period. And that will be followed by oral argument, which is likely to occur in late 2016 or perhaps spill over to early 2017. And then, a decision will be forthcoming sometime after that.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Okay. Okay. So we could see something wrapped up on the initial appeal by mid-2017, give or take, you think is reasonable?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It's probably reasonable, but courts take their own calendar into account in terms of these kinds of things. There's no way to know for certain how long it's going to take once the case has been heard.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Okay. And then, my second question is just as it relates to the likely filing in the summer of an S-1 related to the retail business. Is it your anticipation that the filing of that IPO document would be sufficient to clear the hurdle of providing the nonpublic information necessary to give you and the board the okay to reinstate a buyback program?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, we're certainly not going to discuss capital actions before the filing of the S-1. Once we know more about what direction we're taking here and file the S-1, we'll have greater clarity, and we'll make a decision at that point in time as to what we can or should say regarding share repurchases. Obviously, the form and timing of a separation impacts the cash flows and capital actions. So, all this is kind of coming together as we determine how the separation will take place. And again, at this point in time, we don't know enough to be able to speak to capital actions. And after filing the S-1, we'll know more and we'll then figure out whether we know enough at that point in time to give greater clarity.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Okay. And last one real quick...
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: One thing – one thing...
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): ...and only because I've gotten the question – I'm sorry.
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Let me – just one more thing. I think one thing that's important to remember here is that we at management clearly understand and have stated that we want to return excess capital to shareholders. We also are taking a very bold step here in terms of separating out a major part of our business, what MetLife was founded upon I guess 148 years ago. So I think that really is our first and foremost consideration and focus for us right now. And if we get all this executed properly, which is our intent and our goal, as we've said before, the predictability and the amount of free cash flow as a percentage of our operating earnings we believe will go up, and that really is kind of long-term or intermediate-term payoff for these actions we're taking. I think that really should overweigh or overshadow the near-term impact in terms of timings around share repurchases.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Yeah, I totally understand that. Thank you. And then, I just had one more quick one only because I've gotten this question a couple of times. You've pushed out the date for your Investor Day, I assume it's related to the timing in getting this stuff done as it relates to the retail business, but is there anything more to it than that?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, the planned separation and with the work we're doing around accelerating value, we want to make sure we had sufficient information for our investor base to hear from us. We didn't want to have an Investor Day where we'd say we still haven't determined that or we can't talk about that and so on. So, our initial plans around the Investor Day in terms of timing preceded some of these actions we were taking in terms of clarity around those actions. So, as we step back and thought about it more recently, we said, what's the timing of things that we're going to have to analyze and make determinations on? And some of those items weren't going to be done by the initial date that we had put out there for Investor Day, so we felt that it just made more sense for everyone if we had an Investor Day at a point in time where we could provide greater clarity about the direction of the company going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. So, I had a question first on just the weak sales in Asia and maybe Latin America as well. It seems like there's a major initiative to grow in Asia a few years ago, especially in accident & health. And now, you seem to be pulling back from some parts of the market. So, how much of the decline in sales recently has been in response to macro conditions in Japan versus maybe a change in your view on the economics of the business?
Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region: Hi. It's Chris Townsend here. Let me tell you the story for Asia for sales. So overall, the headline number is down 10%. The Japan sales are flat but with a very different mix, as both Steve and John referenced in their prepared remarks, the Yen life portfolio is significantly down driven by the economics and I think both referenced the long payback period of that and the challenges of low interest rate environment. But this is offset by a significant increase in terms of the foreign currency life and foreign currency annuity products, both of which our customers find highly attractive given the enhanced yield they can get from a foreign currency play. The A&H business is still highly attractive for us and generates very good margins in that business, but there is a packaging issue there for us in terms of when we sell Yen Whole Life, we packaged that often with A&H. And as that Yen Whole Life came down by 60%, the A&H business came down as well. But we'll look to offset that going toward. For the rest of Asia, China was up 16% for the quarter, Hong Kong and Bangladesh had good sales, and emerging markets overall were up 16% for the quarter. The one challenge for us and the rest of Asia was Korea. Korea was down sharply this quarter, but again because of the management or accelerating value action work we've been taking there, we basically changed commissions predominantly in the general agency channel to reward persistency and better customer behavior or better behavior for our customers. And also, we changed the crediting rate in terms of the macro environment there in terms of the lower interest rate environment. But we'll be launching new products there in the second quarter, and we think we'll get the sales back on track for that business. So that's been really a roundup of the sales for Asia.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And on the Yen Whole Life, how much business is sitting on the books now and what are your views on margins on that business given what's happened with JGB yields?
Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region: Let me tell you in terms of the sales, first of all. So, the sales this quarter made up 12% of our total sales in Japan. A year ago it was a third, so we've made a significant reduction in terms of that business. Given that the rate environment there at the moment, we believe that the current margin on that business under a range of assumptions meets our cost of capital for that business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thank you. I realize it's too early to get specifics, but I was hoping you could expand a little bit on your comments that combine the expenses for the remaining Met and the separated combined company would be lower than the current level. It seems a little bit counterintuitive given that you may need separate infrastructure for two public companies, so if you could provide any examples of where you see dissynergies from size, that would be helpful.
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think, Erik, there are synergies from being one company, so if you're going to separate the two businesses by definition, there'll be dissynergies, and there will be in some places duplicative costs if you take no actions. So, what we're saying is that we're engaged in a very rigorous analysis around our cost structure. Part of it has to do with the separation with stranded costs, and part of it just has to do with this macroeconomic environment of lower rates for longer tepid growth, and not just in the United States but globally. So, in that environment, we have to take a very close look at our cost structure and look at unit cost in particular, and that is what we're undertaking as an effort right now.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And does the $250 million of savings from the Adviser sale, is that included in your comments when you say that combined expenses would be less than the current level?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, we're saying above and beyond that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR. Please go ahead.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Thank you. I had a question, thinking ahead a little bit on the NewCo as it likely will be standing alone by April 2017 when the new DOL rule goes into effect. So, if that's purely a manufacturing entity, do you view that NewCo Met as being subject to legal liability under the best interest contract to the extent it's selling variable annuities?
Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut: Good morning. It's Eric Steigerwalt. Look, one of the primary things that we've done is the announced sale of our field force MPCG to MassMutual. And so, given the timing of DOL, our, what we'd call, tied Adviser force will not sell any products under the umbrella of MetLife or NewCo when the DOL regulation goes into effect. That sale will be done long before the DOL regulation goes into effect. And just to give you little color on that, we think we're going to close in July. We're on track to close in July, so the answer is with respect to the biggest piece of the effect on MetLife, which is our own field force in the United States, it will be sold to MassMutual and closed in July.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: But to the extent you're going to manufacture, do you think that the distributor will sign the best interest contract in the VA or indexed-annuity sale? Or would you also be subject to that legal risk?
Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut: So, it's hard to tell. I can talk about that in two pieces. One, obviously, we will have a very important field force which is our wholesaling force going forward, and so you have to think about the DOL with respect to how wholesalers will operate, so that's something that we have to work through over time here. And then secondly, it's just too early to know where distributors are coming out with respect to the regulation. So, maybe four months or five months from now, we'll have a better view of that, but right now given the fact that this is almost 1,100 pages, we're just going to have to wait and see what a number of distributors are going to do.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks. And good morning. I have a question about the variable investment income and specifically what your view of hedge fund investment is going forward, given some of the headlines about pension funds rethinking their strategy and some other insurers and just recent volatility in that asset class.
Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive VP: Hi, Sean. It's Steve Goulart. Certainly, the first quarter was challenging for variable investment income. And if you look at our miss, it was heavily because of hedge fund returns which actually were negative for the quarter. And I think if we look at the market environment that exists today and we can talk about a number of factors, I think it'll be continue – continued to be challenging for hedge funds. I think when you combine that with our capital and cash flow predictability objectives, we've decided that we're going to continue reducing our hedge fund portfolio, as John alluded to in his comments. Just to remind you of some numbers, the portfolio today is just over $1.8 billion, and recall, we did reduce it during the course of last year. Also, we actually ended up redeeming about $600 million worth of hedge funds last year. And as we look out from where we are today, we expect that we're going to redeem probably on the order of another $1.2 billion, so really take the portfolio down by another two-thirds from where it is today. Just given the way redemption provisions work and the industry, I think it will take us a couple of years to do that, but I expect that we'll probably see 60% of those redemptions come in this year and 40% next year, and maybe even leaking a little bit into 2008 (sic) [2018]. Now, I'll also put in the context of our total portfolio though, remember this is actually a very small portion of our total portfolio. Our total alt portfolio is under 2%. As John mentioned, our hedge fund portfolio today is less than half of 1%. So obviously, it's going to become even smaller, but what we'll be left with is a small portfolio of really our most consistently performing managers and hedge fund. So, there'll be a small portfolio left over, but we think overall it doesn't need to be the size it is today.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: All right. Thanks. And when I think about the impacts of variable investment come across the company, is it roughly split along the lines of what the separated business will be versus the go-forward RemainCo Met?
Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive VP: Well, if you look through the segments, I think you can get some numbers from the QFS. It's roughly proportionate. I think you'd find that the retail has a higher allocation in some pieces of variable income and lower in other pieces of it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please go ahead.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Just to quickly follow up on VII. I think last quarter, Steve, you sort of indicated that you'd reassess the outlook for the rest of the year. I think your range quarterly is $300 million to $375 million. Any update there in terms of what we should be thinking about for the balance of the year?
Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive VP: Sure. Again, as I just mentioned, the hedge fund returns were actually negative for the first quarter. And I think if you look at the rest of the year, you have to make some assumptions, of course, and if we were able to see hedge funds and private equity return to our plan expectations for the second half of the year, we'd probably end up around the bottom of the range that we had given for the full year. I will remind you, private equity continues to perform fairly well. I mean, it was slightly below plan, but again, still very positive. And it really – again, most of the underperformance came from hedge funds. So like I said, it depends on your assumptions for the rest of the year. Right now, we're not going to change anything. And if we hit the plan for the second half of the year, we'll be at the lower end of the range.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: All right. And then maybe for Steve, I know it's early days around the separation, but if we think about your consolidated ROE of, I guess, roughly 10% on a normalized basis in the quarter, and we think about this sort of separation, is there any directional guidance you can give us in terms of how you'd think the return profiles of the two businesses would be post-separation?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Suneet, because there's so many moving pieces right now, it's premature for me to give out ROE targets, but I would anticipate we'd talk about this certainly in Investor Day.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: All right. Then maybe just to sneak one last one in. I think, John, you said the stat earnings in the quarter for the U.S. businesses were around $700 million. I think a year ago, it was around $1.2 billion. And I think in the prepared comments you talked about interest rates, but is there any more color you can provide on what caused that big decline year-over-year?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, you have the statutory operating net income. Also some of the derivative accounting goes right through to – it's not in net income. It's statutory goes right through to the equity. So there's a lot of moving pieces when you get into the statutory accounting that we have, particularly in Met U.S.A. that has all of the VAs in it. So, everything is consolidated, remember, in our statutory statements, and you'll see the volatility flowing through here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC. Please go ahead.
Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks very much. John, I have a question about your comments related to dental. Are you saying that the seasonality that you saw in the past – I'm sorry, that the claims that you experienced in the just-reported quarter, the March quarter, were absolutely there in the past as well but were somehow masked? Is that what you mean by other considerations? Is that what you mean when you say the seasonality wasn't evident? And that therefore, since this is, so to speak, normal seasonality that the earnings were in line with your expectations? Or should I be reaching a different conclusion? Thank you.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. So, the last two years in the first quarter, we had pretty tough winter weather conditions, and we saw a decline of frequency of dental claims coming through in that quarter. If you looked at the first and second quarters of the last two years, it got caught up. People ended up going to the dentist, so you had higher frequency in Q2 for the last two years. This quarter, we were just above the high end of our range of our expectations for dental, so it's a little higher than what we had expected. But there is a seasonality to dental. And so we just think that may have been missed as we looked at how a lot of analysts had done the numbers for the expectations for this quarter. So I just wanted to highlight that for you that this dental is more close in line of what we do expect.
Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: All right. Thanks very much. I'm all set.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. And congratulations to everybody. Just one more that hasn't been answered yet. Can we talk a little bit about U.S. Direct? I think, John, you said that sales were down 18%, maybe you could talk about that. And also, am I wrong, wasn't that supposed to be moved from Lat Am?
Maria R. Morris - Executive VP & Head-Global Employee Benefits: Hi. It's Maria Morris. Yes, sales are down this quarter year-over-year, and that's very purposeful on our part. You may have seen that media spending is quite high as a result of both the election and other things going on. So, we're very selective in terms of how we actually put media into the marketplace. So, that's been planned. You probably also noticed, though, that our PFOs are up 34% year-over-year because we've had very strong sales over the last 12 months. And that gives us some optionality in terms of how we're really thinking about sales for this year. We will be moving the U.S. Direct business out of Latin America later this year and we'll obviously be disclosing that when we do so.
Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. So I guess my sense here is the election is taking up too much advertising space, advertising costs have gone up, so it's – you can't beat hurdle rates, I guess, with what you want to pay. Is that the deal?
Maria R. Morris - Executive VP & Head-Global Employee Benefits: Exactly. The way that we actually go to market, as you know, is through both a combination of DirecTV, digital and since the advertising spending is up, plus it's a cluttered space, we made the decision to delay some of that until future quarters.
Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start with the alternative portfolio. So, I heard Steve talk about the added value of the portfolio and how it's actually generated excess returns over the course of a long period of time. And then, I hear John talk about the interest of maybe scaling that portfolio down a bit, at least the hedge fund component of it. Would the thought be that you'd replace some of these hedge funds with other alternative investments? Or should we just think about maybe a smaller benefit or boost coming from overall VII going forward?
Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive VP: Hi. It's Steve Goulart again. When Steve made his opening comments, he was referring to the full mix of variable investment income. So, remember, that includes private equity, that includes hedge fund, there's some old real estate development JVs in there, as well as prepayments. So he was talking about the whole mix. If we look at the hedge fund contribution to that, actually it didn't contribute to it negative – positively over 10 years. It's had up and down years, and really it's just too inconsistent we think in the actual performance. So that's our reason for pulling it out. As far as how to think about it going forward, we're basically just going to – and because the way the redemptions come in, which are spread out over a long period of time, we're really going to look at reinvestment just as part of our overall ongoing regular asset allocation and optimization plans.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. But would the VII component of the overall net investment income come in a bit over the next few years?
Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive VP: Well, as an example, for this year, again, if we look at the planned VII, the hedge fund redemptions would have a very modest reduction to overall VII. It's under $30 million. And going forward, it will depend on the mix that we achieved.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, the other question I had was going back to the Investor Day, so I'm assuming that given the delay and the interest in maybe sharing a little more color with the investment community, at that point then come November, ultimately there will be more publicly available material data out there, would it be fair to assume then that buybacks could be back on the table by November?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yaron, the separation of the U.S. Retail business will be the driving force here. I think at the time of the Investor Day, my guess is it's probably not going to be completed. We'll know a lot more, but we won't have final clarity about our capital needs, et cetera until the actual form is known through the execution of a separation. So, and a lot of that is going to be determined not just by what we want to do, it's going to be determined by the marketplace, what we can do. So, a little bit of this is going to be a timing issue. If we're not able to execute by the time of Investor Day, then we're still going to be not knowing some key components here of the picture that will enable us to be clearer on our capital plans.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And if you are not able to execute or you don't have that clarity at that point, will you still be able to share enough material information with the Street? Or do you think that at that point maybe you'd reconsider holding Investor Day in November?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, we're not going to change the date of Investor Day from November. We'll still hold Investor Day, but we may not have all the answers at that point in time. In fact, I anticipate we won't have all the answers as to how the execution of the separation actually occurred because if I had a guess, it's less likely than more likely that it will be done by then.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. Just a question for Steve. In your letter to shareholders, you mentioned your interest in growing the fee-based earnings organically or through acquisitions. Can you talk about what type of fee-based business that you're interested in growing either organically or through acquisitions?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure, Humphrey. As you know, we purchased ProVida, a pension fund administrator in Chile, a few years ago. That is a business that we found very attractive. We were able to purchase it – a very good multiple of earnings, and it was a business we think will grow over time. We also have started up our own internal third-party asset management business, and we're growing that. So, it's both organic and acquisition-related efforts to grow our fee-based business. So, the asset management space is attractive if we can find the right opportunities, both organically and by acquisition. And we continue to look at opportunities as they become available.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: And then, in terms of the, call it, pension business, granted you have the presence in Latin America, but would you consider growing your pension business elsewhere?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're referring to fee-based businesses like ProVida?
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Yes.
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we would. If we find the right opportunities in other markets, we are absolutely interested in looking at those kinds of acquisitions.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: So, can you maybe – just a follow-up on that a little bit. So, would you prefer like a pension market that has more of a mandatory component similar to what you see in Chile? Or are you open to kind of more broader pension business in general?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I'd say broader. We are opportunistic investors in businesses that we think make sense given our strategy. And we've mentioned before, and including the annual shareholder letter that we would like to grow our fee-based businesses. It's not a big component of our top line or even our bottom line at this point in time. And just from a balance point of view, we think we could do more in that space.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: So, kind of looking ahead and in an ideal situation, how much do you want the fee-based business to represent your total earnings contribution in your kind of longer-term outlook?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We haven't determined a specific percent at this point in time.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions.
Edward A. Spehar - Head-Investor Relations: Okay. Well, I want to spend just 30 seconds to go back to a question that was asked that we didn't answer. It was cut off; it was on Latin America sales. I'm just going to pass it to Oscar Schmidt.
Oscar A. Schmidt - Executive Vice President, CEO-Latin America, MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, Ed. So as we saw, Lat Am year-over-year sales are flat. If you exclude the U.S. direct, and as we know, it's still included in Lat Am this quarter, it moves up to 3%. Now, that 3% is affected by a decline in the reported sales in Mexico. That decline was originally a regulatory change. But that regulatory change there produced lower sales, it's also producing better persistency, no impact in bottom line. So, if you exclude the reported sales, Lat Am growth year-over-year is 8%, which is in line with our expectations.
Edward A. Spehar - Head-Investor Relations: Okay. Thank you all for joining. Have a good day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results, and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factor section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Edward A. Spehar - Head-Investor Relations: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principle, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'd like to turn the call over Steve.
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $1.23, which compares to $1.38 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year decline in operating EPS was primarily explained by variable investment income, or VII, which contributed $0.06 per share to operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus $0.18 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Variable investment income can be volatile, largely because it's driven by returns on alternative asset classes. These asset classes have provided strong returns to MetLife shareholders over time. In addition to a challenging quarter for VII, broad-based strength in the U.S. dollar remained an earnings headwind. Foreign exchange rates hurt operating earnings from our international businesses by $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter versus the prior year period. MetLife repurchased $822 million of shares in the fourth quarter. With an additional $70 million of buybacks in early January and the $107 million of repurchases in the third quarter, we have completed our latest $1 billion repurchase program. As you know on January 12, we announced a plan to pursue the separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. Until we are in a position to disclose details of the separation plan, we are not able to repurchase shares. While the separation plan has a negative impact on capital management in the near term, we are confident it positions MetLife to be a more compelling capital management story over the long term. Exiting a business that has been central to the company since its founding in 1868 highlights our willingness to take bold actions to maximize shareholder value. Two factors drove our decision to pursue this plan: our strategic focus on businesses with capital requirements in higher cash generation and the potential impact of capital requirements on the variable annuity business if it remained part of a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. On the first point, as I have said on prior calls, we have learned a great deal about the cash and capital characteristics of our major business lines as a result of our Accelerating Value strategic initiative. One of the key early learnings from this effort was that the capital requirements and potential volatility of cash flows from the VA businesses do not fit well with our overall goal to deliver predictable recurring free cash flow. Following the separation, we anticipate that MetLife will generate a free cash flow to operate earnings ratio above our current target of 55% to 65%, and with less volatility. In our view, the market does not give us appropriate credit for our higher multiple businesses, because of concern about the potential risk profile of VAs. By separating out of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail operation, we are addressing this valuation overhang on MetLife. On the second point, we believe that regulatory risk is significantly diminished as a result of this plan. The Federal Reserve has made encouraging comments on capital rules for so-called traditional insurance lines, but we are concerned that the Fed could view variable annuities as non-traditional, which is how this product is currently categorized by international regulators. Since we believe the standalone U.S. Retail business would not be a SIFI, separation mitigates the risk of onerous capital rules for the VA business. MetLife continues to challenge its SIFI designation in court, and does not believe any part of our business poses systemic risk. However, we also recognize that the judicial process could take a considerable period of time, especially if either party appeals the District Court's decision. In the meantime, adverse capital rules for VAs could put MetLife at a competitive disadvantage. Finally, as we said in the press release announcing the separation plan, we believe a standalone U.S. Retail business will be more nimble and competitive, benefiting from greater focus, more flexibility in products and operations, and a reduced capital and compliance burden. We know you want more information on what the new company will look like, including specifics on strategy and capital. However, we are able to provide only limited information prior to finalizing the form of the separation. Turning to regulatory matters, I would like to report on two developments in New York that will improve MetLife's ability to return excess capital to shareholders. First, in late December 2015, New York changed the law for calculating ordinary dividend capacity for life insurers, creating a more level playing field with other states. Previously, an ordinary shareholder dividend could be distributed annually if it did not exceed the lesser of either 10% of statutory surplus or the statutory net gain from operations in the prior year. The legislation adds a greater-of test, which is consistent with the existing standard in the majority of states. We had assumed that our New York subsidiary, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, would distribute meaningful capital to the holding company under the old law. However, that assumption was heavily dependent upon extraordinary dividends, which are subject to regulatory approval. While the new law means more predictable, less volatile dividends, it does not change MetLife's commitment to keeping our businesses very well capitalized. Second, the New York Department of Financial Services [New York State Department of Financial Services] is unique among state regulators in mandating certain actual assumptions and reserve requirements through an annual Special Consideration letter. For year-end 2015 financial statements, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is permitted to aggregate all three lines of business, life, annuity, and health, to meet the requirements. Previously, health insurance was excluded. Largely because of this change, we anticipate a reserve release of approximately $1 billion, based on current capital market conditions. While New York's standards remain very conservative relative to other regulatory regimes, the change will make us more competitive with insurers domiciled in other states. In conclusion, we are committed to making the right decisions to produce substantial and sustainable shareholder value. And we are willing to execute bold moves to achieve this goal. Our separation plan will allow MetLife to focus on businesses that have lower capital requirements and greater cash flow generation potential, while creating a more nimble and competitive U.S. Retail franchise. I will now turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion, or $1.23 per share. This quarter included three notable items which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS. First, variable investment income was $71 million after DAC and taxes, which was $137 million, or $0.12 per share below, the bottom end of our 2015 quarterly plan range. Second, we had higher than budgeted catastrophe losses, partially offset by favorable prior-year reserve development, which in total decreased operating earnings by $9 million, or $0.01 per share after tax. Third, we had a one-time tax benefit in Argentina which increased operating earnings by $31 million or $0.03 per share after tax. This tax benefit was a result of Argentina's currency being devalued by 40% in December, which required the remeasurement of U.S. dollar-based reserves into pesos and resulted in an increased tax deduction. Turning to our bottom line results, the fourth quarter net income was $785 million, or $0.70 per share. Net income was $591 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses and losses related to certain variable annuity guarantees where the hedge assets are more sensitive to market fluctuations than the GAAP treatment for guarantee liabilities. The derivative net losses were primarily driven by higher interest rates. The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included an unfavorable impact of $305 million, after tax, related to asymmetrical and non-economic accounting. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $51.15 as of December 31, up 3% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $42.22 as of December 31, up 5% year-over-year. With respect to fourth quarter margins, underwriting primarily in the U.S. was less favorable than the prior-year quarter by $0.06 per share after adjusting for notable items in the both periods. Property & Casualty, Corporate Benefit funding, and Retail Life were the primary drivers of the year-over-year result. In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 96.1% in retail and 99.8% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 89.4% in retail and 96.4% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting was unfavorable versus the prior-year quarter. We experienced higher non-catastrophe claim costs primarily due to elevated frequency and severity in our auto business as well as higher catastrophes in homeowners. We continue to increase prices in Auto which should drive improvement in our loss ratios over the next several quarters. In Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, the less favorable underwriting result versus a strong 4Q 2014 was due to lower mortality experience in our payout annuity business and higher claims in our life products. Fourth quarter underwriting results were within the expected range, and CBF full year 2015 underwriting margins were in line with our expectations. Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 54.9%, which is less favorable than the prior-year quarter of 53.9% and 53.0% in 4Q 2014, after adjusting for a one-time notable item. The year-over-year variance was due to higher average net claims. The fourth quarter benefit ratio is high relative to our full year 2015 target of 50% to 55% because of seasonally high premiums and the related increase in reserves. Finally, the Group Life mortality ratio was 86.8%, and the Non-Medical Health benefit ratio was 77.7%, both within their respective ranges. Turning to investment margins, the average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 170 basis points in the quarter, down 42 basis points year-over-year. Of this decline, 27 basis points was the result of lower variable investment income. Pre-tax variable investment income, or VII, was $109 million, down $216 million versus the prior-year quarter due to weak private equity and hedge fund performance. For the full year, pre-tax VII was $1.2 billion which was below the bottom end of our 2015 targeted range of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 168 basis points this quarter, down 15 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 24.4%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 23.7% after adjusting for notable items in the prior-year quarter. The higher operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to lower pension risk transfer sales as well as higher expenses related to one-time items and timing. I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $582 million, down 19% versus the prior-year quarter, and down 10% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Life and Other reported operating earnings of $195 million, down 41% versus the prior-year quarter and down 26% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting, primarily in P&C and higher expenses. Life and other PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by runoff of the closed block. Retail Life sales were up 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by Term, Whole Life, and Universal Life. Annuities reported operating earnings of $387 million, up 1% versus the prior-year quarter and up 3% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were improved investment margins as well as favorable lapse experience which were partially offset by higher expenses and negative fund flows. Total annuity sales were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum in our index-linked annuity, Shield Level Selector. Shield sales were $361 million in the quarter, which were almost triple the sales in the prior-year period. Also, our VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, continues to gain acceptance in the market and drove VA sales of $1.8 billion this quarter, an increase of 13% year-over-year. Group voluntary and worksite benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $214 million, down 10% versus the prior-year quarter and down 5% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting in auto and lower investment margins. GVWB PFOs were $4.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Sales were up 14% year-over-year with growth in core and voluntary products. Corporate Benefit Funding or CBF reported operating earnings of $286 million, down 21% versus the prior-year quarter and down 18% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were low investment and underwriting margins. CBF PFOs were $886 million, down 39% year-over-year due to strong pension risk transfer or PRT sales in the prior-year quarter. Excluding PRT sales, PFOs were up 39% due to strong sales in structured settlements and institutional income annuities. Latin America reported operating earnings of $150 million, down 1% from the prior-year quarter but up 24% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin American operating earnings were up 14% on a constant currency basis. The key driver was business growth. U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $8 million versus a $22 million loss in the prior-year quarter, reflecting lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, down 2%, but up 17% on a constant currency basis with growth across the region despite the challenging environment. Total Latin America sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to direct marketing in the region. Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $290 million, down 15% from the prior-year quarter and down 9% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 6% on a constant currency basis driven by favorable business growth and lower taxes primarily due to a change in the Japan tax rate from 31% to 29%. Asia PFOs were $2 billion, down 11% from the prior-year quarter and down 3% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the withdrawal of single premium A&H products in Japan which do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment, premium fees and other revenues increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Discontinuing the sale of single premium A&H products is a good example of our focus on cash, return on capital, and payback periods more so than GAAP metrics. We estimate the statutory IRR on single premium A&H is 7% with a 14-year payback period assuming mean reversion for interest rates. The product looks even worse if we assume current low rates persist. While these products could contribute meaningful revenue in operating earnings on a GAAP basis, the economic returns are unattractive. For full year 2015, Asia PFOs were up 4% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were down 1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, representing the net impact of management actions taken across the product portfolio to improve value creation and growth in targeted markets. In Japan, 2015 third sector sales were up 11% versus 2014. Our expectation is for Japan's third sector sales to be down 10% to 15% in 2016 as a result of actions to improve value, including the impact from suspension of our single premium A&H products. Excluding the impact of these actions, our expectations underlying growth in Japan's third sector sales will be consistent with our prior guidance of mid to high single digits. EMEA operating earnings were $54 million, down 16% year-over-year and down 2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for a one-time tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014, operating earnings were up 32% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by business growth, particularly in the U.K. and the Middle East. EMEA PFOs were $625 million, down 7% from the prior year period but up 3% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior-year quarter, PFOs were up 10% driven by Gulf, Turkey and the U.K. Total EMEA sales declined 11% on a constant currency basis due to strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East and the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior-year quarter. In Corporate and Other, I would like to remind you of the timing of our preferred dividend payments. With our refinancing discussed on our second quarter 2015 call, we now pay dividends on our $1.5 billion Series C preferred stock on a semiannual basis. As a result, you will see preferred dividends paid in the second and fourth quarters of approximately $40 million related to this security. On an annualized basis, the lower dividend will generate a net savings of approximately $20 million during the first five-year fixed term of the security. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.4 billion at December 31, up from $5.5 billion at September 30. This amount includes inflows from our subsidiary dividends and the issuance of senior debt, offset by share repurchases, the payment of our quarterly common dividend, and other holding company expenses. In addition, our 2015 free cash flow ratio was 63% of operating earnings after adjusting for the third quarter non-cash charge of $792 million after tax. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2015, we estimate our combined U.S. RBC ratio will be above 450%. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 936% as of the third quarter 2015, which is the latest public data. In conclusion, fourth quarter operating earnings were below expectations as a result of lower investment margins, primarily due to VII, ongoing pressure from foreign currency, less favorable underwriting, and higher expenses. While the current environment remains challenging, we are confident that our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I'd like to just first ask about the comment that you can't buy back stock until more details of the spin are provided. I just want to clarify, is this the registration statement with the SEC in the next six months, or are there other events that we need to wait for before buyback can resume?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Seth. We are in possession of material non-public information, regardless of the form of the transaction, so we are unable at this point in time to engage in any further repurchases.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Could you just give us an indication of, either what events or timeframe we should be waiting for, for when you will no longer be in possession of this? What's the trigger, I guess, is the question?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Seth, we're working hard toward determining the form of the separation, and until we have determined that, we won't be in a position to do share repurchases. I don't have a specific timeframe for you. The form of the separation could be a public offering. It could be a spinoff. It could be a sale of the business or some combination of these options. And it's still too early to determine which of those it will be.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then, maybe just to follow up on the spin, and specifically on comments you made in your December outlook call about no longer needing to build the capital buffer, does those commentaries – and understanding that you're unable to buy shares now – but independent of that, did that comment contemplate the need to potentially capitalize a spin company, and does this alter your view of your HoldCo capital position and adequate capital buffer?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That wasn't the reason for the comment, and we'll still have to wait to see how the form turns out, of the separation, before we know the capital positions of both remaining company and the new co.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, so...
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: This is John. Want to just add to that that, we are, as Steve said last December for our total business, we are comfortable with our capital buffers that we have here. But there's a lot to calculate out, depending upon the transaction and the form of separation. So that's work that has to be done, and that is underway, and we're working on that. But it doesn't change our view of the total capital we have for our total business.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. So just to clarify, just want to not run the risk of extrapolating any statements here, the comments that you don't need to build a capital buffer related to MetLife as a combined entity, and does not contemplate a potential spin and actions that might need to be taken for that?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, that's right, Seth. Because we have said there are three – there's various forms that we're looking at. It could be a spin. It could be an IPO with a spin. It could be a sale. So all those have kind of different capital implications for both the separated company and the remaining company. So that's work that has to be done. But we are comfortable with our total capitalization that we have for our total business.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. On the U.S. Retail separation, it seems like many of the details, like the nature of the separation, branding, haven't really been finalized, as you mentioned. So just want to get an idea on your timing of when you announce – made the announcement, why did you make it when you did, versus waiting till you had decided on some of these items?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Jimmy, we did a lot of work before making this announcement to pursue a separation of much of our retail business, U.S. Retail business. But more work had to get done to answer some of the questions you just raised, and many others. And to do that would require a much larger group of people both within the company and outside the company to make those determinations. And as a practical matter, it would have leaked out to the public that we were engaging in this plan to pursue a separation. So our view was once we made the initial determination that a separation was desirable and we were going to pursue that plan, now we're able to bring in many more people to do the analysis that will lead to the answers to the questions you just raised.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then can you give us an idea on the expected timing of the separation? Because it seems like an IPO or a sale would be difficult in this environment. So obviously spin is an option, but how do you try to balance doing it in a timely fashion versus maybe being opportunistic and maximizing what you're able to get from the business?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We're not in a position to give any guidance at this point in time in terms of the timing. I can only tell you that we've been working hard on our strategy for over a year now. We made this announcement about the plan to pursue a separation, and we are working very rapidly on answering all the questions that we need to answer to determine the form of such a separation and we've moving as quickly as one can.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then maybe if I can just ask one on the business. Your alternative investment income obviously as you mentioned was pretty weak in the fourth quarter. So just give us some insight into what drove that, whether it's private equity, hedge funds. And how – what's your view on some of those asset classes on how they're performing as it relates to the first quarter? I think you should have some insight given the reporting lag on private equity and on hedge funds.
Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive Vice President: Jimmy, it's Steve Goulart. Just recapping the fourth quarter, I mean, certainly we were disappointed in the performance of the alternatives portfolio, both private equity and hedge funds materially underperformed our plan and that's been somewhat unusual. But anyway that's really what happened. Prepayments were still very strong in the fourth quarter. And as we look forward to this year, you talked about first quarter. Obviously the market sort of came out of the gate on the wrong foot perhaps, a lot more volatility than expected. We don't see any reason to change the plan yet. We'll see how it unfolds. Obviously there's a lag in the portfolios, one quarter on PE, one month on hedge funds. So you can sort of look at what has transpired. But I'd also remind you that when we look at correlation, while there's kind of a directional correlation, the correlation isn't really that high in trying to compare it exactly. So we're sort of sticking with the plan for now. I would also say though that we've engaged in some repositioning in the portfolio during the course of the latter half of last year. We reduced the alternative portfolio by about a billion dollars split between the hedge fund and private equity portfolios, really concentrating on the managers and strategies that have been the longer-term stronger performers for us and that we feel are confident are going to deliver that performance going forward. Like Steve said in his opening remarks, this is a portfolio that has provided strong returns for us and for our shareholders over some period of time. We expect it will continue to do so. Obviously we're managing it and monitoring it very closely just given what we did late last year. And then particularly the hedge funds, they're a little bit in the spotlight just given the last couple years of underperformance there. So (34:42)
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And specifically on private equity, is it more sensitive to the level of market because that drives the marks, or is it more sensitive to IPO activity? Because I can understand fourth quarter being really bad because the S&P was down like 7% in the third quarter but it bounced back and was up almost 7% in the fourth quarter. So is it more the ending level of the market than the previous quarter, or is it actual IPO activity that influences your private equity returns more?
Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, like I said, we've studied a lot of different correlations, and it's hard to really tie any of them. So I think directionally it's a little bit both of what you said.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. First question, Steve, is just based on what you have proposed so far in terms of the split and what remains with Met, which I'll refer to as RemainCo, it looks like close to 20% of the earnings in RemainCo, which would be retail, would essentially be a closed block, if I'm understanding it correctly. How should we think about that conceptually? Is that a business that you also might be open to divesting, or should that be considered a closed block with the remaining business, or is that one still up in the air? That's my first question.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Tom, this is John. It's something that's still under review that we're looking at. And as we develop future plans on this, we'll let you know.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then the next question is a broader one. Steve, is the ultimate goal here really to de-SIFI? I mean, I realize you're still not done with the court case, but let's just assume for a minute that you don't win that. Is the plan here to still get out of SIFI? How critical is that to you? Or do you believe the split kind of eliminates the need to de-SIFI here?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Tom, the decision to separate the U.S. Retail business, a significant portion of it, was really driven by two factors. One, our strategy work that we have talked to you about as well as the regulatory component. And when we do our strategy work, regulatory environment, business environments within markets are very central to that analysis. So those two things in combination led to the decision for the separation in pursuing the separation of the U.S. Retail business. In terms of overall, our view on the SIFI designation, we continue to believe that we are not a SIFI under Dodd-Frank. We are pursuing our appeal rights in the District Court of the District of Columbia. There's a hearing next week Wednesday, February the 10th, on the case, and we look forward to the judge's decision.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi. Good morning. So, John, I appreciate the commentary on the risk-based capital ratio or at least the estimate as of year-end 2015. So it looks like a pretty significant increase on a year-over-year basis from something, I think the adjustment was slightly under 400% for the U.S. at year-end 2014. Can you give us some sense for what the risk-based capital ratio looks like for the three entities that are part of the spin? I believe those entities were somewhere just north of 400% at year-end 2014. Should we think about a similar kind of boost in year-end 2015 for those entities?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, John. It's John. I really can't until we finish our cash flow testing and the actuaries sign off on their statements and we follow our blue books to really give you any details. And you'll see that all when it all gets published. You know, because of the impact of the change of the SCL (38:56) that Steve mentioned, that's helped our total ratios, our total combined ratios where we're moving up higher. But that's, until we get all that work done, we can't really give any details such as you're asking for.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: You know what, we're announcing a week earlier this year than we did last year, so that's why the timing is a bit off here.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Appreciate that. I guess my second question is a bigger picture question around Japan. Obviously you guys have taken some action around product offerings given the interest rate environment. I'm wondering, given the Bank of Japan's actions last week and the significant shift in JGB yields across the curve, whether there is something more specifically that has to be done now in response to those actions. I mean, I think there's negative yields all the way up to nine years on the JGB at this point.
Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region: Hi. It's Chris Townsend. Let me respond to that. So in the short term, the falling interest rates are going to have a negative, or sorry, have a positive impact on the SMR (40:06) as the asset values will appreciate, but a potential negative impact on our U.S. GAAP earnings due to lower investment income. And that's very manageable. It's immaterial in the bigger picture of things. Over the long term, a continued lower rate situation, you can accredit drag on earnings impacted by reductions to NII, earnings and distributable cash, but as those Japanese yen yields reduce, foreign currency products may become more popular, supporting our existing strategy to move away from the yen products, the foreign currency products. On the yen products themselves, we've taken significant action on our portfolio well in advance of the recent DOJ announcement. So what we've done is to de-risk or to reduce the focus on our Yen life portfolio by reducing commissions in that area, doubling the ticket size, continuing to focus on packaging of A&H products to enhance the returns, and also to incentivize some of the FX life products. And we took that action at the back end of the third quarter, and if you see from the sales results in terms of the life business in Japan for the fourth quarter, it was up 2% year on year for the fourth quarter, and the mix of that underneath that is quite interesting because the foreign currency life is up and the Yen life is down, which is exactly what we wanted to happen. And I think you'll see that play out as we go into the rest of 2016.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on Seth's question on I guess the capital buffer. Is it – I guess, Steve, is it fair to say that when you talked about holding a capital buffer for non-bank SIFI risk that a fair amount of the buffer was related specifically to the variable annuity business?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we don't know what the capital rules will be. The Federal Reserve has not released anything yet. There are some international draft rules out there, but they've already said they'll be changing those. So it's really just a level of comfort, I think, that we have to have. We do a lot of stress testing ourselves. We have an economic view of our risks and feel that this size buffer was sort of where we should be knowing what we know at the time we make that call. And we reassess this on an ongoing basis. As capital rules get announced, we will know what it is. We do know that variable annuities have been discussed by many regulators as being a product that may attract higher capital requirements. So that clearly is one of the larger, say, capital risk products out there which makes the separation quite compelling.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Understood. On the RBC ratio, obviously you talked about the $1 billion reserve release that certainly contributed to the increase in the year-over-year RBC ratio. Were there any other big key factors that you can help us understand at this point?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That's probably the most major one.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And then just lastly, can you guys give us an update on your energy portfolio and where that stands at this point?
Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Ryan, it's Steve Goulart. Just to update on the energy portfolio. We did take the opportunity most of last year to start reducing that portfolio. We sold almost $2 billion out of it. It ended the year just under $12 billion. And, again, 86% of that is investment grade. It's tilted more towards sort of the defensive sectors in the portfolio, mid-stream refiners, that sort of thing. So I think we're comfortable. We're obviously sort of – we run it through constant stress tests, just given the energy environment, and I think, at year-end, there was an unrealized net loss of about $220 million on the portfolio.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks very much. You said that on a company-wide basis, you're comfortable with the level of cushion you have, but you've also said that – I don't know whether it was unexpected, but regardless, you had a $1 billion increase in your statutory surplus as a result of the change in New York State accounting rules. Should we infer from these two statements, when we think of them together, that some of this $1 billion is going to be above and beyond what you consider to be your adequate capital cushion, and that therefore some of this $1 billion could become available for redeployment?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Eric. We view capital on a total holistic basis...
Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Sure.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Whether it be at the holding companies, within the regulated companies. We had always viewed this amount that was in these reserves as, really capital, but they were in a reserve that would be paid out over time, of course. So, I think the best way to think of this is, this is capacity that we have as we think about our total capital position, and we will have to see in terms of redeployment, as Steve said, we can't make any decisions on that until we get further along with the separation.
Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: I have one question related to operations. Because of the decision to pull back in Japan, it seems like even on a, let's call it, just apples-to-apples basis, adjusting for notable items, adjusting for currency, adjusting for the withdrawal of the single premium product, that, well – that growth is quite slow right now in terms of premiums, fees and other revenues. And I guess my question is, once you get through this, let's call it, transition period – product transition period, what do you – how do you think of the sustainable growth rate for the whole Asia region, given that you have sort of cross currents there? You have a very mature market in Japan, but you are rapidly growing markets in Southeast Asia. So on sort of an overall basis, how should we think about the sustainable growth rate, once we get through this transition period, for Asia? Thank you.
Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region: So, it's Chris Townsend. Let me respond to that. So, first of all, there is no change to the guidance we provided in December across all of the key metrics for Asia. And we gave you some, I think, fairly clear guidance in terms of earnings and revenue in the medium term. And we're sticking by that guidance overall. In terms of Japan, we're doing the right thing in terms of creating value for our shareholders in terms of the product portfolio. And those items I responded to one of the prior questions on, in terms of Yen life (47:40) will definitely increase the value of our business. If you look at A&H and the third sector, where we make some very solid margins, we gave earlier guidance of mid to high single digits. We updated that guidance to a range of 10% to 12%, and we came in at 11%. So I think we've delivered well in terms of that business for this year. And John gave some fairly clear guidance, in terms of his prepared remarks, as to what's happening with that portfolio overall. So, I actually think we've had a fairly solid year in the Asia region overall, with our normalized constant rate earnings of 15% or 16%, which is again ahead of guidance. So, in conclusion, we're sticking with the prior guidance we've given.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Good morning. I have a question regarding your auto business. Can you provide some color in terms of claims experience in the quarter, excluding cat and prior-year (48:44) development versus 3Q? And also, with 4Q in the books, does it change your view for the outlook for 2016, in terms of the loss ratio expectations?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Humphrey, were you (48:59) talking about the auto business?
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Yes.
Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - Executive Vice President, U.S. Business, MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Humphrey. It's Eric. We took about, I would say, in 2015, roughly 2% rate throughout the year 2015. Going into 2016, we'll slightly more than double that. Auto was clearly up in Q4 2015 versus Q4 2014. We actually – if you want to talk about total combined ratio, homeowners in Q4 2014 was fabulous, frankly, so that was up in Q4 2015. Still a very good result. On the auto side, like many of our peers, or at least one peer that's reported so far, we're still seeing elevated severity and frequency. As I said in the third quarter – and obviously I'm talking about just retail here. In a minute I'll let Maria comment on group. In the third quarter, I mentioned, and I think so did some of our peers, that miles driven is up. I would also add – and I may have mentioned it in the third quarter as well – that claim costs are up as well, which shouldn't be surprising. So, even though we saw elevated experience in the fourth quarter on the auto side, we're pretty comfortable that the rate we're going to take in 2016 will offset those results, and we should be right about where we want to be as we get near the end of 2016. Maria?
Maria R. Morris - Executive VP & Head-Global Employee Benefits: Hi. This is Maria Morris. And with regard to the group business, we see the exact same trends as we saw in our retail business, so obviously both frequency and severity up. Eric talked about a lot of the trends underlying that. I would mention one thing on severity, we do notice that, with a lot of new cars on the road, that the cost of actually repairing those is up, with the computerization and other things in new cars. So, in addition to obviously more miles driven, we've got also the issue with regard to severity. And we've been taking rate as well, so – in the mid single digits. And I would note that in group, even as we're taking rate, we still have double digit sales increases year-over-year. So we're focused just as we are in retail on continuing to take rate throughout 2016, and we're bullish on the prospects for growth.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Got it. And then shifting gears to Latin America, the U.S. Direct business continued to be an earnings drag for the segment. How long do you expect the unit to turn profitable? Is it a matter of scale or is it – are there some levers that you can pull to drive improvements in that particular business?
Unknown Speaker: Sorry. So you're referring to currency or to the growth of the business?
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: No, just from the earnings perspective.
Unknown Speaker: Right. Well, as you know, we have been facing to start saying (51:56) currency issues in Latin America, the impact is around 20% during the last year. But if you think about growth, excluding that and excluding the U.S. Direct business and adjusting for notable items in the current and fourth (52:15) quarter, (52:16) were flat year-over-year. But strong growth of approximately 11% happened adjusting for all that. We gave you guidance of upper single digits, and we continue supporting that despite from (52:32) currency. We see further deterioration of local currencies against dollar but not as big as we saw before. So in the core business in local currencies, we sustain our high single digits.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. I want to go back to the separation plan and the announcement regarding the buyback cessation for the time being. So first, Steve, I think in your comments to Tom's question, you said that really the separation plan is not just regulatory driven, it's also part of the strategic work you've done. So with that in mind, why go through the court challenge at this point if, ultimately, even if the challenge let's say was accepted, you'd still go through the separation plan?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yaron, as we've said many times, we don't believe we are a SIFI under Dodd-Frank. 80% percent of the company remains after the separation, if it were to occur, and that remaining 80% will be impacted by whatever capital rules the Federal Reserve comes out with as well as the number of other matters related to compliance that will relate to being designated a SIFI. So there's still a significant potential burden that'll be placed upon the remaining company that would put us potentially on a unlevel playing field with our competitor who are not SIFIs.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So why not file the challenge after the separation plan if you're still designated then?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You have one chance to file a legal challenge to a District Court, and that is within 30 days of being designated, which is what we did.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then the credit rating agencies came out with a few negative outlooks after the plan was announced. Could you comment on those and maybe what you can do in order to alleviate their concerns?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Often I think you'll see whenever a firm announces a significant transaction where they're buying something or selling, or just separating something, the rating agencies put you on Watch or Outlook just until they get more details and can sort out exactly what's going to happen. We announced a plan to pursue a separation. We have to sort out a lot of details, including how this will all work. And we will present that to the rating agencies when we have that work completed, and then they'll be able to have an appropriate view. So this is – we're in a transition period, a holding period, with the rating agencies until such time as we can get them more information.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then finally, I guess, this is more a comment than a question on my part. In the December outlook call, you basically said that you'd be increasing the capital deployment, given a changing in strategic view and given the buffer that you'd built. I would have thought that at the time, you knew that you were going to go through the plan or announcing the plan of a separation, and it just creates a lot of back and forth here, I think, in terms of how investors think of the buyback program and the timing thereof. So I just – I would have thought that this could have been handled differently. And I guess that's my comment and want to see if you had any reaction to that.
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: What we are doing throughout our work on strategy is to find ways to maximize value for our shareholders. We've talked about a focus on cash and growing businesses that threw off (56:30) more free cash flow and returning any excess capital to our shareholders. We also look at all of our businesses in terms of their viability longer term and how best they may be viable in the marketplace. And it was our determination after a great deal of work that the U.S. Retail business would be more viable long term as a separate entity. So once we made that determination, we made that announcement that we'd be pursuing a plan to separate. And as I've said earlier in the call, a great deal of work has to still be done to effect that plan and to determine which avenue we take to separate that business. But all this is done through the lens of creating shareholder value.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thank you. In retail, you mentioned higher direct expenses. Can you just discuss the drivers in the quarter? And also should we expect to see any increase in spending in either retail or at a corporate level in anticipation of the separation?
Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - Executive Vice President, U.S. Business, MetLife, Inc.: It's Eric. I'll start out. It was kind of across the board. Corporate overhead was higher, including some advertising costs. We had some legal reserves set up in there. Generally, fourth quarter is higher. So this isn't really out of line with what we would expect. Going forward, I would expect in the first quarter, you'll see something that looks more like a normal first quarter. But maybe I'll let John or Steve comment if they want to add anything.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Just want to add about do we expect to have some expenses to do the work on the plan to pursue the separation. Clearly, there will be some cost. But the costs will vary depending upon what ultimate form we take, so it's still too early to give you any guidance on that piece of it.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, Eric, just a question, with the prospect of a final DOL rule seemingly pretty close, can you just talk about what steps you're taking to prepare and maybe if you've had any discussions with third party distributors about their comfort selling products under the current Best Interest Contract Exception (sic) [Exemption] (58:45)?
Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - Executive Vice President, U.S. Business, MetLife, Inc.: I'm sure you've heard this from others as well. We're thinking of every angle based on what was previously put out by the DOL. But as you know, we don't have anything. It's – the regulation is with OMB now. We would expect to see it, let's call it, 40 days to 70 days, something like that. So we're thinking about the various forms that it could take, again, based on what we saw previously. We have talked to a number of distributors. I don't think it would be appropriate for me to share some of those conversations. But suffice to say, we are considering all potentialities from both a product perspective and how you distribute and anything else that would result from the actual regulation coming out. So more to come. And obviously, all of us will be able to add to this dialogue when we see it sometime in the March/April timeframe.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I just want to say at the end of the call here that the key message I want to leave with all of you today is that management is doing everything possible to unlock value for our shareholders. And the things you've heard about recently from us in terms of the U.S. Retail separation and the strategy work we're doing with Accelerating Value is driven by that desire.
Edward A. Spehar - Head-Investor Relations: And that brings us to the top of the hour, so we're going to end the call. Thank you very much for your participation.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the MetLife's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results in the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission including in the "Risk Factors" sections of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Edward A. Spehar - Head of Investor Relations, MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2015 earnings call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally-accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly-comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are; Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of our management team. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported third-quarter operating earnings per share of $0.62, which included a pre-announced non-cash charge of $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned, UK-based investment subsidiary. Adjusted for this and other notable items, operating earnings per share were $1.36 in the quarter which compares to $1.51 on the same basis in the prior-year period. Adjusted for notable items, operating return equity was 10.7% and tangible ROE was 13.1% in the quarter. While operating EPS adjusted for notable items, we're down this quarter, our nine-month results on the same basis were up 3% with an operating ROE of 11.5% and tangible ROE of 14.2%. Macroeconomic factors, foreign currency, equity markets and interest rates explain the year-over-year decline in third-quarter operating earnings per share adjusted for notable items. Broad-based strength in the U.S. Dollar reduced operating earnings for international businesses by $0.09 per share with significant weakness in the Mexican and Chilean Pesos, the Aussie Dollar and the euro. Equity market performance relative to the prior-year quarter hurt operating earnings by $0.04 per share. Most of the negative impact was in retail annuities. The poor equity market performance also hurt the co-investment related earnings from ProVida AFP. The persistent low interest rate environment remains challenging and reduced operating earnings adjusted for notable items by $0.03 per share relative to the third quarter of last year. Investment margins have been resilient in recent years as a result of affected asset liability management, low interest rate hedges, and variable investment income. However, we face ongoing headwinds from new money yields that are 100 basis points to 150 basis points below the portfolio yield and from the gradual expiration of derivative protection. From a balance sheet standpoint, we believe low interest rates are a manageable risk. For example, we completed our annual actuarial assumption review in the third quarter and the negative impact from low rates on net income was less than $180 million. A key driver of this charge was an assumption change on how long it would take for the 10-year treasury yield to reach a normalized level. We are now assuming it takes 11 years for the 10-year treasury yield to increase to our normalized assumption of 4.5% versus three years previously. Turning to regulatory issues, we recently received a clearance indication to date regarding the Federal Reserve's thinking on capital rules for federally regulated insurance companies. In a speech delivered in late September, Federal Reserve Board Governor, Dan Tarullo, commented on the importance of a liability side of insurance company's balance sheet when constructing capital rules. He said, "Traditional insurance liabilities argue for lower capital requirements that might be required for hypothetical bank holding a similar portfolio of assets." These are welcome comments made possible by the enactment of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act in December of last year. At the same time, Governor Tarullo said the balance sheets of many large life insurers contain liabilities that he does not consider traditional. Our takeaway is that while the Fed clearly recognizes the difference between the bank business model and the insurance business model, we still need to see draft capital rules before we can draw any firm conclusions about the impact on our business. On a parallel track, international regulators are developing capital rules for global systemically important insurers. Here too, the news is mixed. On October 5, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors released its proposal for higher loss absorbency capital requirements or HLA. While MetLife holds capital comfortably above the levels prescribed by the IAIS, we have two concerns with the methodology. The first is that the required capital levels in the international framework are pro-cyclical and potentially volatile because they are based on a mark-to-market approach that ignores the ability of insurers to hold assets for the long term. The second is that the IAIS proposes to apply higher capital charges to so-called non-traditional, non-insurance activities. Certain products with guarantees such as variable annuities are deemed non-traditional while other products with similar guarantees sold by competitors elsewhere in the world are deemed traditional. This highlights the risk that MetLife has consistently identified in determining what is systemic that regulators will inadvertently pick winners and losers in the life insurance industry. The good news is that the IAIS has said the higher loss absorbency rules will be subject to revision before the target effective date of 2019. In fact, the IAIS is launching a review this month of the definition of non-traditional insurance. It has said that any changes will flow through to the HLA rules. Another regulatory issue MetLife is following closely is the Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary rule. As drafted, the rule would make it significantly more difficult for life insurance companies to sell variable annuities. MetLife has shared its concerns with the DOL in comment letters. And a majority of members in both the House and Senate had asked the department to make changes to the rule. In addition, several members of Congress are beginning to work on a legislative alternative to the DOL proposal which underscores the growing awareness that the proposal will harm consumers by reducing choice and limiting access to financial education and investment advice. I would now like to comment on cash distributions to shareholders. As you know, on September 22, we increased our share repurchase authorization from $261 million to $1 billion. We are comfortable with this authorization given our current capital position which we continued to maintain above historical levels because of uncertain capital rules. Since the announcement, we have repurchased $261 million of stock, including $107 million in the third quarter, and we plan to remain an opportunistic buyer of our shares. In the first nine months of 2015, our total payout to shareholders was $2.3 billion, with roughly an even split between share repurchases and dividends. This total payout equals approximately half of our nine-month operating earnings adjusted for notable items and is in line with our guidance of a 45% to 55% ratio of free cash flow to operating earnings. MetLife's philosophy remains unchanged. Excess capital belongs to our shareholders. In my annual letter to shareholders this past March, I said that free cash flow generation has become an enterprise-wide imperative for MetLife, one that will form all of our major business decisions in the months and years ahead. As mentioned during our second quarter earnings call, we've undertaken a granular analysis of the cash and capital characteristics of our business. This ongoing work is helping us improve our capital allocation process, which we expect will drive more value for shareholders over time. In closing this morning, I want to provide an update on the management structure of our Americas region. MetLife is taking a deliberative approach to find the right leadership for the Americas. While our search continues, we have named Eric Steigerwalt as interim head of the U.S. business reporting to me. In addition to retail, Eric will oversee our other U.S. businesses: Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, Corporate Benefit Funding, and U.S. Direct. Oscar Schmidt will continue in his role as head of our Latin America business, also reporting to me. Both are strong leaders focused on generating long-term value for MetLife's shareholders. I will now turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Steve and good morning. Today I'll cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses, and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. Operating earnings in the third quarter were $705 million or $0.62 per share. This quarter included five notable items which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS. First, we had a previously announced non-cash charge of $792 million or $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Second, as a result of our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, we had an after-tax charge to operating earnings of $92 million or $0.08 per share. The total after-tax charge to net income was $210 million. Retail accounted for $228 million, partially offset by modest positive earnings impact in Asia and EMEA. The impact in retail was mainly due to the change in our assumptions to reflect the persistent low interest rate environment and our current view that rates will remain below normal levels longer than we had originally assumed. As you heard from Steve, we are now assuming that it takes 11 years for the 10-year treasury yield to reach 4.5% versus three years previously. We've also lowered our long-term earned rate assumption for annuities from 5.25% to 5%. Our long-term earned rate assumption for life insurance is unchanged at 5.75%, and our long-term separate account return assumption remains 7.25%. Third, variable investment income was $174 million after taxes and DAC, which was $37 million or $0.03 per share, below the bottom end of our 2015 quarterly guidance range. Fourth, we have favorable one-time tax items in the Americas, which increased operating earnings by $72 million or $0.06 per share. Finally, we had lower than budgeted catastrophe losses in favorable prior-year reserve development, which increased operating earnings by $21 million or $0.02 per share. In total, notable items included in operating earnings were $828 million or $0.73 per share. Turning to our bottom line results: Third quarter net income was $1.2 billion or $1.06 per share. Net income was $492 million higher than operating expenses, primarily because of derivative and investment portfolio net gains. The derivative net gains were driven by lower interest rates and strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies. The investment portfolio net gains were mainly the result of real estate sales. The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $568 million related to asymmetrical and non-economic accounting after tax. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $51.11 as of September 30, up 3% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $42.21 as of September 30, up 6% year-over-year. With respect to third-quarter margins, underwriting, primarily in the U.S., was less favorable than the prior-year quarter by $0.03 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Retail life and other and property and casualty were the primary drivers of the year-over-year result. Retail life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 53.4%, excluding a 4% point impact from the actuarial assumption review. The ratio was less favorable than the prior-year quarter of 51.0% on a comparable basis but within the expected range of 50% to 55%. Average net claims from large based policies were higher than the prior-year quarter but within the normal range of expectations. The group life mortality ratio was 86.1% or toward the low end of the expected annual range of 85% to 90%. The ratio is favorable to the prior-year quarter's 87.8% due to better claims experience. The non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 80.7%, approximately in line with the prior-year quarter of 80.5% and within the targeted range of 77% to 82%. In property and casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 90.9% in retail and 97.7% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 84.0% in retail and 92.7% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting was unfavorable versus the prior-year quarter. We experienced higher non-catastrophe claim costs primarily due to higher frequency and severity in our auto business as well as higher catastrophes. Turning to investment margins; the average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 202 basis points in the quarter, down 28 basis points year-over-year. Pre-tax variable investment income was $267 million, down $157 million versus the prior year quarter due to weak hedge fund performance and lower prepayment income. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 172 basis points, down 13 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline as a result of the low interest rate environment. With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 24.2%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 23.0%. There was an interest-related component of the non-cash tax charge that flowed through expenses. Excluding this item, the operating expense ratio was 21.4% or 160 basis points better than the prior year, primarily driven by strong pension closeout sales. I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $523 million, down 33% versus the prior-year quarter; and down 10% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Life and other reported operating earnings of $183 million, down 50% versus the prior-year quarter and down 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were lower expense margins, less favorable underwriting primarily in P&C and lower recurring investment income. Life and other PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by runoff of the closed block. Core retail life sales were up 36% year-over-year primarily driven by whole and term life. Annuities reported operating earnings of $340 million, down 19% versus the prior-year quarter and down 8% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were less favorable initial market impact, higher expenses, and taxes. The separate account return was negative 6% in the quarter. Total annuity sales were $2.4 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum with our index-linked annuity Shield Level Selector and we expect this product to exceed $1 billion in sales this year. Also, our new VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, continues to gain acceptance in the market and drove VA sales to $1.8 billion this quarter, an increase of 15% year-over-year. Group, Voluntary, & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $238 million, down 1% versus the prior-year quarter and essentially flat after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Business growth in the quarter was offset by less favorable underwriting in P&C primarily in the auto business. GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Sales were down 12% year-over-year as we continue to see an impact from increased competition in life and dental. Sales of voluntary products increased 24% due to growth in property and casualty. Corporate Benefit Funding or CBF reported operating earnings of $326 million, down 17% versus the prior-year quarter and down 13% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $1.7 billion, up significantly year-over-year due to strong pension closeout sales in the quarter. Excluding closeouts, PFOs were down 15% due to lower structured settlement sales. Latin America reported operating earnings of $176 million, up 44% in the prior-year quarter and 100% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, primarily Chile taxes, Latin America operating earnings were down 4% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were less favorable underwriting and unfavorable market performance, partially offset by growth in the region. U.S. Direct which is included in Latin America's results had an operating loss of $7 million versus $15 million loss in the prior-year quarter reflecting lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $940 million, down 18% and essentially unchanged on a constant currency basis as growth in ProVida and Argentina was offset by lower single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile. Total Latin America sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis primarily due to direct marketing across the region, partially offset by lower 40%s (22:59) sales in Mexico and single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile. Turning to Asian. Operating earnings were $338 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter and up 26% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 22% on a constant currency basis driven by favorable business growth, $21 million in investment income from a loan sale and an unusual low tax rate. Asia PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 13% from the prior-year quarter but up 3% on a constant currency basis driven by higher A&H in Japan. Asia sales were down 10% on a constant currency basis due to two large group cases in Australia in the prior-year quarter. Excluding these cases, sales were up 6%. A highlight in the quarter was a 23% increase in Japan A&H sales as we continue to benefit from a refurbished product portfolio. EMEA operating earnings were $66 million, down 15% year-over-year, but up 14% on a constant currency basis, adjusting for notable items in both periods. Operating earnings were up 25% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth, particularly in the Gulf and the U.K. and favorable tax items. EMEA PFOs were $618 million, down 15% from the prior year period and down 1% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter, PFOs were up 4%. Total EMEA sales declined 8% due to strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East and the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for these items, sales were up 3% driven by A&H, partially offset by lower than expected life and retirement sales. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.5 billion at September 30. The decrease from the previous quarter was driven primarily by the payment of our quarterly common dividend, interest expense, and share repurchases. Turning to our capital position, we report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin was 959% as of the second quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data. For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary third quarter statutory results are an operating loss of approximately $900 million and a net loss of approximately $700 million. As previously disclosed on a statutory basis, the non-cash tax charge was $911 million in the quarter. Of this charge, $972 million (sic) [$792 million] (25:57) went to the statutory earnings and $119 million directly into surplus. In addition, earnings were negatively impacted by the stock market decline in the third quarter. Our strategy is to under-hedge for smaller market moves and accept the resulting volatility while ensuring we have sufficient hedges to protect against extreme shocks. We estimate our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $29 billion as of September 30, which was comparable to December 31. In conclusion, third quarter operating earnings had several notable items that negatively impacted results, and market factors were unfavorable relative to the prior year. However, quarterly volatility is to be expected. While we were short of analysts' expectations in the third quarter, we exceeded expectations in the first two quarters of the year. We are striving to create long term sustainable growth and value and improvement in our free cash flow generation and material increase in distributions to our shareholders highlight this commitment. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. One moment, please, for the first question. Your first question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Steve, I would like to start with the comment that you made about – and I guess it was a backward-looking comment how you were indicating you have returned roughly 50% of normalized GAAP earnings to shareholders through buybacks and common dividends. Is that a reasonable expectation going forward from here? Because you obviously still have uncertainty with regard to the lawsuit with the government and SIFI rules but is the plan in place that you have and the expectation that we should have that 50% type distribution while you are in this state of limbo?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Tom, let me answer you in one second. But John just wants to make a quick correction to his comments.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. As I was going through my script, I said one number slightly backwards. Of the statutory charge in the quarter, of the $911 million of the charge, it's $792 million went to statutory earnings. I believe, and it was pointed out to me, I said $972 million. So it's $792 million went to statutory earnings and $119 million went directly into surplus
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Tom, things – obviously, I'm moving around as we hear from policymakers in Washington around the capital rules. As of now, there's no draft capital rules out for us to look at and consider with respect to our business. So while we thought these rules would be out well before now, we're still waiting. And our decision a couple years back was to begin returning capital to shareholders, excess free cash flow, and we built up what we believe is a good buffer but again, it's uncertain and we don't know how this will all play out. So right now it's a little bit of a judgment call. And we are in this year looking to return to shareholders the free cash flow that the business generated. I think if nothing changes in the external world, that'd be the pace we'd be on going forward in 2016 as well but I have to put some caveats in here because there could be a change in the environment that we learn about at some point in the future but that is our current thinking.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. So the 50% if nothing else changed, let's say it continued to be delayed for whatever reason, you'd be comfortable with the 50% based on what you know today?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We'd be comfortable with what we're generating in terms of free cash flow and we are targeting at the 45% to 55% levels so assuming we achieve that, that would be a fairly good number to think about and if draft rules come out next year, that could impact our thinking, of course.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then the changes or the charges that you had this quarter related to both the tax item as well as the change in RBC coming from some adjustments to the variable – the onshoring of the variable annuity business, so the impact from that, would that affect the way you're thinking about returning capital and cash flow or no?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi. This is John. Our guidance of the 45% to 55% is still within the RBC and the tax charges that we've already spoken about.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then one last one if I could sneak it in, the cash flow project, can you comment on what should we be thinking related to this? I presume the goal is to move it higher but are we talking about, from the 45% to 55%, are we talking about potentially moving it meaningfully or do you think it's going to be very marginal in terms of where this might go?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Tom, we're in the process of finalizing our analysis on this so it's too early to say how that number would be impacted. But the goal clearly is to raise the number and we are looking at all of our businesses by product, by geography, by customer. There's a great deal of very granular analysis that's ongoing and we are looking at a number of factors as we think of our businesses including quicker paybacks on our products. So the goal here is to improve free cash flow and I should mention that companies that have undergone this process in the past and primarily in Europe took a number of years to go through this process. We are trying to condense that to a shorter period of time but it's not an exercise that one could go through in a couple of quarters. So we'll have more to say about it clearly next year but you can be assured that we are working very hard on driving higher our free cash flow ratio and as we learn things along the way here with our analysis, we're making adjustments on an ongoing basis.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. So the first question I had is just on yours spreads. Even if we exclude the variable investment income, spreads came down a lot especially in the corporate benefit funding business I think they are 117 basis points versus almost 150 basis points in the second quarter and the third quarter of last year; so what drove the decline, and is this the normal base that you are looking to grow off of or was there something abnormal in the second quarter that would have pressured your results beyond the variable investment income impact?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Jimmy. This is John. So, CBF spreads, look in our quarterly financial supplement, do bounce around quarter to quarter. We had in December 2014, in our guidance call, said our spread outlook would be between 150 basis points to 170 basis points with 30 basis points to 40 basis points from VII, if you look at it for the nine months, we're at 173 basis points with 39 basis points from VII. But the third quarter was at the low end at 149 basis points with 32 basis points from VII, so you can see how this moves around quarter to quarter, a lot of VII second quarter. Remember we pointed out an accounting change that we did to also give a boost to the second quarter of CBF but within this guidance, it still makes sense for the 150 basis points to 170 basis points.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then on the $900 million statutory charge from foreign tax credits, I think you mentioned previously that the impact on your dividend capacity for 2016 would be around $90 million. Should we assume a commensurate impact in future periods as well beyond 2016?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: This is a one-time charge, remember statutory dividends are determined a year after the fact. The reason why it is not a larger impact is we are up against the lesser than rule of the New York which is dividends are the lesser of 10% of surplus or your earnings in the year. So this did affect as I said our statutory earnings, but it did not affect the dividend capacity for next year because we are bumping up against a 10% number, the 10% limitation.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you and just lastly on variable investment income, the weakness this quarter I'm assuming it's hedge fund driven and maybe the other private equity and prepayments were somewhat normal but maybe if you could give us some color on what drove the downside this quarter?
Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Jimmy. It's Steve Goulart. In looking at variable investment income for the quarter, most of the decline relative to plan in our range was in hedge funds. I think if you just look at what's happened in the market hedge funds had a pretty weak quarter and we saw it come through. I think John mentioned prepayments in some of his remarks but prepayments were still in line with plan, they were just down from a high quarter on a year-over-year basis. So it's really all about hedge funds and VII. And as we look forward to the fourth quarter we are comfortable that we will be back in the range that we have set out the $325 million to $425 million per quarter that we gave originally.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please go ahead.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Just a question John, I was writing down numbers pretty quickly did you say – can you go over the stat earnings in the quarter again on an operating basis?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Happy to. Let me just look at that page. For our U.S. insurance companies, our statutory results were an operating loss of approximately $900 million and a net loss of approximately $700 million. And of course this has the non-cash tax charge, it was $911 million on a statutory basis, $792 million went through statutory earnings and $119 million directly into surplus.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: So if we think about that $900 million loss, so you got $792 million of it from the charge so then there is a $108 million loss beyond that. I mean is that – essentially are all the stat earnings being offset by the fact that you have under-hedged on the equity side?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, that was one of the major impacts and it's not under-hedged, we don't fully hedge on smaller market moves but we have a macro hedge that protects against larger market moves, so we're trying to be cost-efficient in how we do this. We're willing to take some statutory volatility quarter to quarter to have an economical return on this product line but we're well protected if larger shocks kick in.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then my second question for Steve I guess is, in the press release you talk about the ROE, ex AOCI and other FCTA of 10.7% and I know you don't give guidance on ROE but as we think about kind of the trajectory of this, does it feel like the ROE is sort of bottoming at this level or could we see some continued pressure on that ROE?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Suneet, obviously, the external pressures on us are significant and we've discussed that. I'd say in the near term given current interest rates and the macroeconomic factors, in that high 10%, 11% range is probably what we're looking at.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning. Steve, I wanted to return to your comments regarding Fed regulations specifically Tarullo's comments on non-traditional activities. I know earlier in the summer you spoke about funding agreements, commercial paper, securities lending and guaranteed investment contracts in terms of an area that the Fed may be looked closer at. If these were deemed non-traditional and were holding you up for the SIFI designation, how quickly would you be able to exit these businesses and would you consider doing that if it would have a substantial regulatory benefit?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Those are short duration businesses and liabilities. So we could move pretty quickly. What we would do is once the capital rules came out, we would look at the cost and benefits to the company overall and we have to make a decision based upon that analysis. So until then, it's hard to say what we actually would do but in the day, it ended up being a fairly straightforward analysis for us.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. And regarding variable annuities, do you have any hints if this is something the Fed considers non-traditional similar to how the international regulators are looking at it or is this something that the Fed has perhaps shown some comfort around?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi. Seth, it's John. The Fed has given no guidance as to what they're considering to be weighted in different ways. They're looking at all aspects of the insurance business and the industry is in discussions with them but they really have given us no indication at this time as to how they'll view any line of business.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks for the comments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. With regard to the pushing out the long-term 10-year treasury rate assumption to 11 years from three years, what are the implications on that for future margins? It seems like it would be less of a drag going forward.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Jay. When we say less of a drag, I mean, it's just a slope, takes longer. We think a GAAP charge in that today as you can see and then it just – the earnings flow through over time. So I guess maybe I could follow up if you clarify your question a little bit?
Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure. It seems that if the assumption was – previously it was going to be three years to get there and now we're talking 11 years, there might be less additions to reserves going forward? Is that – am I thinking about that the right way?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well it would be now set, if interest rates go up exactly according to this slope, then you'd have normal profits coming through and no changes to DAC amortizations. This is primarily a DAC change. You have less profits in the future, so you need to adjust your DAC today and the patterns go out in a consistent manner.
Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then on the – I guess, a follow-up on the ROE comment, if I plug in 11% return on equity, I guess, around $6.0 in earnings next year, that seems to be perhaps a little bit less than consensus was expecting. Any potential offsets to that that we should be thinking about?
Edward A. Spehar - Head of Investor Relations, MetLife, Inc.: Hi, Jay. Well as I'd like to remind you, we don't give forward guidance. We've given you our views and I guess you can do your calculations so thanks.
Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on the higher P&C auto claims. It seems like you are experiencing the same issue some others in the industry are going through. Is this something that you'd expect to recur for a period of time before you can get rate increases pushed through?
Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut: Hi. It's Eric. We probably are. I think it's fair to say we're experiencing reasonably what the rest of the industry is. You've heard from other companies that they've been talking about more miles driven, as a result, higher accidents. You heard John say that overall our results frankly in both group and retail is slightly higher frequency and severity. So we're not sure if this is going to continue for quarters and quarters and quarters. We are all over price increases. When we feel we have to take them, as we have in this year, we will. And over time, we'll let you know what our decisions have been going forward. So right now, we don't see anything far out of line with what we've been expecting. But if we continue to see pressure, then you can be assured that we will take increases.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then for John; do you have any preliminary expectations for the impact of year-end statutory asset adequacy testing?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, that would be done at the end of the year. It depends on where interest rates end up and other factors. So I can't give you, I can't predict where interest rates will be at the end of the year. And that's one of the most sensitive points.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. I got it. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Thank you. In the past you've talked about a potential present value GAAP hit from sustained 2% rates is I think $3 billion. Are there any changes to that expectation or should we just think about the rate adjustment this quarter of the approximately $180 million is just subtracting from that amount?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi. This is John. That would be correct. We view the changes we made this quarter were consistent within that overall guidance that we've given.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. And then on Japan, just one question. You mentioned the third sector sales being up 23% this quarter. Can you comment on the competitive trends in that market and how long of a sales cycle you see for the new products that you introduced?
Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region: Yeah. Sure. Chris Townsend here. So we introduced those new products in the beginning of the fourth quarter last year. And as you can see, we've had pretty good growth right through the first three quarters of this year. So overall, third sector was up 23%. We've got a tough comparison coming up against the fourth quarter of 2014, but I think overall, the prior guidance we've given you in terms of sales in the third sector was that we would grow it mid to high single digits this year. Given the performance we've had so far, we can lift that guidance now to a full year at about 10% to 12%. So the new products are progressing really well. They give customers good choice. They're simple products, they got segmented pricing. And all four of our key distribution channels are up, so we feel pretty good about that third sector right now.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. I actually want to follow up on Erik's question on the assumption review. So looking at this $3 billion in present value that you had talked about in the past from the low interest rate environment forever and comparing it to the $180 million in losses we saw this quarter, I was under the impression in the past that you had expected to see a lot of the charges coming in the first three years to five years. And in that sense I was a little surprised to see a relatively small impact from the new assumption this quarter and just wanted to square the two.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think what we had said before when we gave this guidance about $3 billion, most of it is in DAC. And as you change your assumptions, that tends to be immediate of course on your DAC amortization. There's also U.S. GAAP loss recognition testing that if you need to increase those, that's done over time. What I had said was I didn't expect to change assumptions immediately. To go right down to flat 2% forever would take some time for us ever to change our view on that as the world might change. Because for 10-year treasuries to remain at 2% forever means either no inflation or there's very little growth in the U.S. economy. We don't believe long term that that is the case, but we now believe it will take a lot longer to get there from where we are today. So that's the assumption change. And as I said, the calculations we have done are consistent with the prior year guidance that I've given.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay then that's helpful. And then turning back to P&C for a second, I was just wondering what was causing the more elevated or the greater deterioration, I guess, in group P&C versus retail, bearing in mind the industry trends that we're seeing in frequency and severity?
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Are you talking about – we didn't quite hear your question. Are you talking about the differential between group and retail? Was that part of your question?
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. That's right.
Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So, buried in there as we add a little IBNR change so that's why the subtlety of my previous answer might have been missed but if you think about it, if I were to normalize that IBNR change, I would say that the hit to group and retail was roughly the same and completely driven by, as we already said, miles driven, both frequency and severity in both businesses. So that's a little bit more of a normalized answer there.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kovac from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Mike E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. With the equity market volatility, clearly you saw the impact in the annuities segment for you and your peers. I am wondering if you can discuss some of the moving pieces particularly around how managed volatility products and your hedge program performed in the third quarter versus both your expectations and maybe some other market downturns?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Michael. This is John. As I said, the separate accounts were down about 6%. Our managed vol funds actually did a little better than that but were still negative. They were just around 4.5% – was about the amount for the target vol funds. So target vols are supposed to be better but to react in a quick quarter like this, it's harder for these so they did perform a bit better than what the S&P did which is down about 7% and our separate account returns in total were down about 6% but not flat or anything. It was a pretty rough quarter for the equity markets.
Mike E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then as you think about variable annuity sales going forward, I know you had guided to 50% and then 20% in this quarter came in about 15%. Any thoughts on the outlook?
Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut: Yeah, this is Eric. The number that I've been looking at – so you are quoting the pure variable annuity number. When I look at VAs and our Shield product, in the third quarter, we were up 26% and that is quite a good result. Our Shield sales continue to increase quarter-over-quarter, after quarter, sequentially and I think we are going to see the same thing generally in VAs. Certainly as we moved from 2014 – frankly from the 2012 through 2014 period of decreasing sales, 2015 was that inflection point and honestly very hard to project. So we are below what we had thought we would be able to do. There is a number of reasons for that. This quarter obviously volatility in the equity markets, state approvals throughout the year play a big part; certain key states came a fair amount later than we had thought they would. However at this point, sales are looking pretty good, the Flex product continues to take hold both in our captive channel and in all of our independent channels. So I am confident going forward that we will see good sales results, certainly double-digit sales results.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hey. Good morning, everybody. A lot of questions asked and answered. You have a wide range for the loss expected for the corporate segment for the full year. I think if we make all of your normalizing adjustments you're around a $420 million loss but you have a range of I believe it was $550 million to $750 million. Can you give us some help on what end of that range or where in that range you expect to end the year given you have got just a few months left?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'd still stick with that range. We have timing of preferred dividends now. We refinanced one of our preferred dividends and there's a gain this quarter because it's now a semi-annual dividend and it'll hit the fourth quarter so there's going to be some bumpy timing as we look quarter to quarter now. The old preferreds that we took out were quarterly dividends so it's smoother. The new piece that we did, it is a net savings to us by doing this but it'll be more bumpy.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay, that is helpful. And then I wanted to think about the – on a normalized basis the Asia segment has seen a reasonable amount of volatility in earnings for a business that I think should generally versus more of your capital markets sense of the businesses, I would expect it to be a bit more stable and predictable. That range is pretty wide on a quarterly basis. So just thinking about second quarter and third quarter here in particular, which one of those normalized numbers do you think is a better true indication of the earnings power of that business that you're annualizing?
Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region: Hi. It's Chris Townsend here. We gave some guidance previously in terms of the range. It was a low single to sort of high single to low double digit earnings rates on a constant rate basis for Asia and we're still sticking with that in terms of the year for 2015. If you look at this quarter, for instance, obviously last quarter we had that very high one-off tax issue in Japan which threw the numbers out. But for this quarter, the constant rate growth is 26% and there's three main items in that. One is business growth which accounts for about 11% or 12% of that. One is favorable investment income of $21 million which is about 7% and then there's a couple of one-off tax items. So you should probably think about 310 to 320 (54:53) plus or minus 5% is the sort of average run rate for the Asia business.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): That's very helpful. Thank you, Chris.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks very much for including me at the end here. A couple of quick questions. The increase in the number of years that you expect to be 10-year to reach 4% I think in the quarter from 3 years to 11 years strikes me as a major change. And so my question is at least it strikes me that way. So my question is, is this something that you have decided recently that you have been thinking about for a while? And given that interest rates have actually risen this year, treasury yields are flat but credit spreads have widened. As you think about what has happened in the world, what has prompted you to make what seems to be such a dramatic change in your outlook for interest rates? Thanks.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Eric. This is John. So obviously, where interest rates go long-term is very important for us in how we price, how we think and how we account for our business. We spend a lot of time thinking about 4.5% is still the correct long, long-term assumption and when I say long-term, we're putting liabilities in the books today that may last for 100 years given life expectancies of young people. So it's a very long-term assumption. So that we think about that and the question is how fast will we get there and I would say currently and we talked to a lot of economists and academics on this and looked at the global economy, I think given this year compared to even a few years ago where there was much more optimism about the recovery of the world economies, we see a much slower growth for now and for the foreseeable future. And that's why we put a longer slope going out on the treasury rate which is the risk-free rate. When it comes to credit spreads, we really normalize those over the entire credit cycle and the fact they're up in the quarter or down in the quarter doesn't really impact our thinking over a very long-term cycle. And we study credit spreads over decades and that's how we set these long-term assumptions and we're lucky we have experience of credit cycles over decades and have very good experience in this. So that's of our thinking and behind how we set these assumptions.
Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks, John.
Operator: And there are no further questions.
Edward A. Spehar - Head of Investor Relations, MetLife, Inc.: Okay, well thank you very much for joining. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2015's Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Ed Spehar: Thank you, Greg. Good morning everyone, and welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2015 earnings call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Kandarian: Thank you, Ed, and good morning everyone. We are pleased to report strong results for the second quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.8 billion, up 11% from the second quarter of 2014. And operating earnings per share were $1.56, a 12% increase over the prior year period. Operating return on equity was 12.5% in the quarter, and tangible return on equity was 15.3%. Second quarter results were negatively impacted by the strong dollar. Operating earnings grew 11% on a reported basis, and 16% on a constant currency basis. Favorable tax items, improvement in both investment and underwriting margins, and growth in this business more than offset the negative impact from foreign currency translation. Investment margins remain healthy in the quarter with an average investment spread for U.S. product lines of 227 basis points, versus 215 basis points in the prior year period. This spread has been in the range of 210 to 240 basis points during the past few years, which highlights the resilience of our investment margins despite a multiyear period of low interest rates. Underwriting margins were also favorable in the quarter. After adjusting for notable items, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that underwriting margins have improved versus the prior year period. In the second quarter, underwriting margins were better in Retail Life, Group Life, Group Non-Medical Health and Property Casualty. Turning to regulatory matters, I will begin with a brief update on our appeal of the government's designation of MetLife as a Systemically Important Financial Institution or SIFI. Tomorrow the Financial Stability Oversight Counsel will file a brief opposing MetLife's motion for summary judgment, and supporting its own position. On August 21st, MetLife will file a final reply brief. At this time, the judge has not informed us whether she will be holding an oral hearing. And the timing of a final decision is difficult to predict. With regard to capital rules, the passage of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act late last year provided flexibility for the Federal Reserve to develop rules appropriate for the business of insurance. The Federal Reserve is working on the required standards, and I am hopeful that those deliberations will lead to a suitable proposal. Developing an appropriate insurance capital standard in the United States is also important to informing the development of global capital standards. While the timing for producing a domestic capital standard remains uncertain, we believe global standards should not be finalized before a domestic standard is developed. Upon completion, both standards should be tailored for the insurance business model. We are supportive of legislation that has been introduced to encourage greater transparency, and increased congressional oversight of U.S. participation in the international standard-setting process. Another policy issue MetLife is following closely is the proposed fiduciary rule in the Department of Labor. While proponents argue the rule will help individuals save for retirement, we believe it will have the opposite effect by reducing choice, increasing cost, and limiting access to financial education and investment advice. Wealthier investors may not be significantly impacted by the rule because their assets generate sufficient fees to pay for investment advice. However, assets of middle income investors are unlikely to generate fees sufficient to offset the higher costs of offering advice under this rule. Consequently, those consumers could find it difficult, if not impossible to receive face-to-face investment advice. The proposed rule is particularly problematic for individual annuities, which are the only products that provide consumers with a variety of benefits, including guaranteed return income they can never outlive. The proposed rule effectively makes it a conflict of interest to sell your own products. Without substantial modifications, the proposal could force companies such as MetLife to choose between manufacturing individual annuities and distributing them. It is unclear what public policy goal is served by making it more difficult for companies to provide guaranteed retirement income to consumers. MetLife submitted comments on the proposed rule to the labor department last week, and the department will be holding public hearings from August 10th through August 12th. We are confident that policymakers can find a way to protect the interest of consumers, while still preserving access to much needed retirement advice. I would now like to comment on cash. As I said in MetLife's most recent annual report, we need to do a better job of generating free cash flow, which is the most important metric in determining a company's ability to return capital to shareholders. I am pleased that the ratio of free cash flow to operating earnings has been on a upward trend, since 2012. And we remain confident in our target of 45%-55% for 2015 to 2017. Increasing the amount of cash generated by the business is an enterprise-wide imperative at MetLife. Our focus on cash is an extension of a strategy that we announced in May, 2012, which centered on improving our return on equity, while also reducing our cost of equity capital. We have successfully repositioned our business to achieve higher returns with lower risk. And are now working diligently to make sure the products we sell strike the right balance between returns, and cash generation. I have three observations I would like to share with you related to this initiative. First, we are conducting a granular analysis of the cash and capital characteristics of our business. And in each segment that we have examined, we have identified opportunities for improvement. Second, our goal is not maximum fee cash flow today, as that would mean foregoing attractive investment opportunities in the business. Our goal is to grow free cash flow over time. Third, while we are working toward a business model that will produce compelling growth in free cash flow, we also have the potential to optimize our balance sheet if MetLife's SIFI designation is overturned or the new capital requirements are reasonable. Finally, I want to recognize the contributions of Bill Wheeler to the success of MetLife. As most of you know, this is the last earnings call for Bill, MetLife's President of the Americas region. As we announced in April, Bill is retiring next month after 17 years with the company. I want to take this opportunity to thank Bill personally for all that he has done to help MetLife and me over the years. Bill has contributed in numerous ways to MetLife's success. As Treasurer, he played a critical role in taking MetLife public, in 2000. As CFO, he helped guide the company safely through the financial crisis. And as President of the Americas, he restructured the U.S. retail business, and led our acquisition of Provida. When I joined MetLife as Chief Investment Officer, in 2005, Bill did more than anyone else to help me learn the insurance business. Especially the liabilities side of the balance sheet. During my time as CEO, Bill has been a strong partner in developing and executing on our strategic plan. Bill, on behalf of our employees, our customers, and our shareholders, thank you for all that you've done to make MetLife one of the greatest life insurance companies in the world. In closing, MetLife had a strong quarter with double-digit operating EPS growth, despite ongoing pressure from low interest rates and a strong dollar. We continue to face regulatory uncertainty, but remain hopeful the outcomes will be manageable. Finally, we are focused on improving the cash flow characteristics of the business. An effort that we believe is necessary to maximize shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John Hele: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our second quarter result, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses, and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. Operating earnings in the second quarter were $1.8 billion, up 11% from the prior year period, and up 16% on a constant currency basis. Operating earnings per share were $1.56, up 12% from the prior year period, and 17% on a constant currency basis. This quarter included one notable item in our Asia business. As discussed on our first quarter earnings call, effective April 1st, the Japanese corporate tax rate was reduced from 31% to 29%. As a result, we've recorded a one-time tax benefit of $174 million in the second quarter. The operating earnings portion of the one-time benefit was $61 million, or $0.05 per share. We estimate that the current year tax benefit from the rate reduction will be approximately $24 million in 2015. Adjusting for notable items in the current and the prior year period, operating earnings were up 10% and 16% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers of growth on a constant currency basis were favorable investment margins, business growth, lower taxes, and under writing improvements. Higher expenses were a partial offset to these favorable items. Turning to our bottom line result, second quarter net income was $1 billion or $0.92 per share. Net income was $723 million less than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative losses. These losses were driven by higher interest rates and weakening of the U.S. dollars against certain currencies. The second quarter variance between operating earnings and net income includes asymmetrical and non-economic accounting of $856 million after tax. Net income adjusted for asymmetrical and non-economic accounting was above operating earnings primarily due to the portion of the onetime tax benefit in Japan, not reflected in operated earnings. Book value per share excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, was $50.73 as of June 30th, up 4% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $41.73 at June 30th, up 8% year-over-year. With respect to second quarter margins, we continue to see a good rebound in underwriting results, which were up approximately $0.03 per share after adjusting for notable items in the prior year quarter. Underwriting improvement was primarily due to better mortality experienced in Retail Life, which returned to a normal level after adverse claims experience in the first quarter. Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 53.0%, within the expected range of 50%-55%, and favorable to the prior year quarter of 55.2%, after adjusting for a one-time benefit related to a disability waiver reserve. Average net claims from large based policies declined from an elevated level in the first quarter. The group life mortality ratio was 86.1% or toward the low end of the expected annual range of 85%-90%. The ratio was favorable to the prior year quarter of 86.9%, due to the lower claims experienced across several products. The non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 80.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 82.8%, and within the targeted 77%-82%. Disability results improved year-over-year due to the lower incidence and severity, as well as higher net closure. In Dental, as anticipated, we saw higher utilization following low utilization in the first quarter. We believe the low utilization in the first quarter was a function of adverse winter weather. In Property and Casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 100.1% on retail and 96.0% in group. The combined ratios excluding catastrophes were 80.2% in retail, and 85.5% in group. Overall P&C underwriting results improved versus the prior year due to the lower cat losses, and more favorable prior year development. Turning to investment margin, the average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 227 basis points in the quarter. Higher recurring net investment income benefited from a conversion of the securities accounting system for the U.S. general account. And this contributed approximately 5 basis points to our product spread.  Excluding this adjustment, the simple average was 222 basis points, up 7 basis points year-over-year due to higher variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income was $427 million, slightly above our 2015 quarterly guidance range of $325 million to $425 million. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $278 million, up $57 million versus the prior year quarter due to good performance across asset classes. Product spreads excluding variable investment income and the accounting system conversion were 182 basis points, down 8 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average new money yield continued to run roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average yield in the assets rolling off the portfolio. With regard to expense, the operating expense ratio was 24.3%, unfavorable by 110 basis point to the prior quarter of 23.2%. Approximately half of this increase in the ratio was attributable to lower operating revenues from single-premium product. Sales of these products can fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter. Expenses were elevated in the quarter due to higher costs within MetLife's employee benefits program, and higher regulatory costs. Expenses can be volatile for both of these categories. We would expect to see operating expense ratio improvement in the second half of the year relative to the second quarter. Gross expense saves were $262 million in the second quarter, and net saves were $194 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $33 million, and one-time cost of $35 million. I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $690 million, up 2% versus the prior year quarter, and up 6% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in Retail was driven by favorable underwriting, and higher variable investment income. Life and Other reported operating earnings of $278 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter, and 16% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were favorable underwriting, primarily in life, and higher variable investment income. Life and Other PFOs were $2.1 billion, essentially flat year-over-year as growth in the open block was offset by runoff of the closed block. Core Retail Life sales were up 4% year-over-year driven primarily by an increase in Term life. Annuities reported operating earnings of $412 million, essentially flat to the prior year quarter. Higher variable investment income and lower taxes were offset by lower core spread, higher expenses, and a less favorable initial market impact. Variable annuity sales were $1.9 billion in quarter, up 16% year-over-year and sequentially. We are seeing good traction with our new VA-guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, which was launched in February. We expect to see FlexChoice sales continue to grow in 2015, but at a less rapid pace than we had expected. Also sales of single-premium immediate annuities are below our plan. As a result, we are lowering our expectation for total annuity sales growth in 2015, from more than 50% to more than 20%. GVWB reported operating earnings of $231 million, up 11% versus the prior year quarter, and 9% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in the quarter was driven by underwriting improvement and business growth. GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Sales were down 13% year-over-year as we were seeing an impact from an increasing competition, particularly in Dental. Sales of voluntary products increased 22% due to growth in Accident & Health, and Property & Casualty. Corporate Benefit Funding reported operated earnings of $406 million, up 12% versus the prior year quarter, and 19% after adjusting for excess variable income in the prior year quarter. The key driver was an increase in investment margin. CBF PFOs were $455 million, down 44% year-over-year due to lower pension closeouts, and structured settlement annuity sales. On closeouts we continue to see a good pipeline of small to mid-type cases. And we wrote a contract, in July, with over $500 million of premium. Latin America reported operating earnings of $116 million, down 15% from the prior year quarter, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Direct, which included Latin America's result, had an operating loss of $20 million, versus $8 million in the prior year quarter. The loss this quarter was higher than expected due to business strain from strong sales, up 70%, and claims volatility in the quarter. We expect losses to moderate in the second half of the year. Excluding U.S. Direct, Latin America operating earnings were up 13% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth partially offset by a less favorable market impact. Latin America PFOs were $1.1 billion, down 3%, but up 13% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth across the region. Total sales were down 40% on a constant currency basis primarily due to a large contract in Mexico in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding this contract, sales were up 4% versus the prior year quarter. Turning to Asia; operating earnings were $425 million, up 31% from the prior year quarter, and up 45% on a constant currency basis driven by lower taxes as a result of the Japan tax rate change, and strong business growth across the region. Asia PFOs were $2.2 billion, down 4% from the prior year quarter, but up 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by a strong growth across all key markets. Asia sales were up 1% on a constant currency basis due to growth in Japan, and continued growth in the A&H sales across the region offset by a decline in retirement sales. EMEA operating earnings were $50 million, down 31% year-over-year, and down 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for favorable tax items of $7 million in the prior year quarter, operating earnings were up 6% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth, particularly in the Gulf and the U.K. EMEA PFOs was $658 million, down 8% from the prior year period, but up 10% on a constant currency basis. Total EMEA sales increased 7% on a constant currency basis due to strong growth in employee benefits and A&H sales across the region. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash in liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.2 billion at June 30th, which is up from 5.7 billion, at March 31st. This increase reflects subsidiary dividend, the repayment of senior debt, and the payment of our quarterly dividend. We also refinanced our $1.5 billion Series B Preferred Stock during the quarter. The lower dividend would generate approximately $19 million as savings on a full-year basis during the first 5-year fixed term of the securities. Turning to our capital position; we reported U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the second quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin was 957% as of the first quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data. For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary second quarter statutory operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $900 million. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $28 billion as of June 30th, which was comparable to December 31st. In conclusion, MetLife had a strong second quarter. Investment margins remain healthy, and underwriting improved year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong, and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Eric Berg: Thanks very much. John, you have indicated that because of Met's status as what I believe is the only listed New York-domiciled life insurance so the only listed large New York-domiciled life insurer, the other big New York companies are mutuals of course, that you've accumulated substantial additional reserves above and beyond what would have been the case if you were, say, a New Jersey company or domiciled in any other state. What is the status of your efforts to -- not to release, but what is the schedule under which you would release these reserves in connection with the rise in interest rates?
John Hele: As a New York company and other NIC companies, we do annual cash flow testing. And these are typically done under the NIC guidelines set by the actuaries of the company and the chief actuary of the company signs off on how these reserves are tested. These are done every year at the -- based on the yields at the end of the year, and there are shocks down from there based on typically prescribed rates. New York through prescribed letters they send to us each year suggest more conservative reserves often than our actuaries would set on a normal basis. And this is some of the additional reserves that we hold in New York. Of course, as interest rates rise slowly over time, and we continue to do the cash flow testing, some of the reserves that have been set up for lower interest rates would be released. But it depends each year on how New York suggests to us to set our assumptions for those reserves, and it would be released over time. Because often the reserve increases are over a period of time, or they could be immediate, so it depends on the type of testing that we are doing. So slowly over time the answer is how we would expect that some of this would be released as interest rates rise.
Eric Berg: One question for Steve to wrap up; Steve, you've said publicly that, and I won't quote you I don't remember exactly what you said, but I think the spirit of what you said is that I think you said at one of the conferences where you gave a presentation that you're feeling better than you have been feeling about the tone coming out of Washington, and the general outlook for, that you were hopeful about a reasonably positive outcome for Met and others with other systemically important financial institutions regarding capital requirements. What exactly is happening? What's the basis for your optimism or increasing hope that we're going to get a favorable outcome here? And am I characterizing your position, your thinking correctly? Thank you.
Steve Kandarian: Eric, we've been working closely with policymakers and regulators over the last several years since Dodd-Frank was passed. And the nature of our conversations and tone of our conversations provide me more optimism than I had, let's say, three or four years ago. But again, we try to be cautious in our optimism because obviously if we were to be too aggressive on capital management and the rules were disadvantageous to us, we would not want to have to go to the marketplace and raise large amounts of equity to meet rules that, again, we don't have yet in draft form. So I am more optimistic that the conversations have developed over the years, where I think there's a better understanding of the insurance business model as compared to the banking model that regulators in Washington have historically been involved with. But the optimism is tempered by caution on our side in terms of being certain that we are well capitalized as these draft rules finally do come out at some point in the future.
Eric Berg: Okay thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger: Thanks, good morning. Steve, in the last call I think you said that you would evaluate potential buyback again in the back half of this year. Can you give us an update on how you're thinking about that?
Steve Kandarian: Sure, Ryan. If you recall, the second repurchase program that we've announced for the last year or so was announced in December, and began in January in terms of execution. So when we put that plan in place, we had an expectation that it would be completed by the fall of this year. As we had said, when we announced the plan, we would be opportunistic buyers of our stock. And you may recall that in the first part of the year our stock dropped a fair amount, and was below $50 a share for a period of time. So that program was completed in three months, roughly, versus the time period we expected, which was really off into the fall. So our view now is that we will look at this again later in the year, as you mentioned. We'll have a conversation with our Board in the fall, and we'll make some decisions at that point in time.
Ryan Krueger: Okay, thanks. And then a question for Bill on the Group business, it seems like growth has decelerated a little bit. Can you talk about the dynamics there and your outlook for growth?
Bill Wheeler: Sure, Ryan. Well, I think there's a couple of things going on, one is, in certain segments of the market, especially I think the dental business I think the competitive environment has gotten more challenging. And I think that therefore our wins on new businesses are lower than they otherwise might be. Secondly, remember, we've been being pretty aggressive about renewals and new business in our disability area, feeling that we needed to kind of catch up a little bit on our pricing. And I think that's depressed sales a little bit in disability. You can certainly see it in numbers. Our disability new sales are pretty low. Renewals are good in terms of we're getting our price on renewals, but the new business we're getting is pretty low. So I think those two factors are causing the premium growth in the group business to be a little lower than you might otherwise expect.
Ryan Krueger: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. The first question is just on interest rates. I think when you had given guidance or targets for the various businesses you had assumed a 10-year treasury yield of around 2.8% by the end of the year. So assuming if rates stay where they are through the next few months of the year, how much of a downside risk is that to your targets? And are there things in the business that are going better than expected that maybe might help offset some of the weakness? And then also I had a question on the hedge for Asia earnings. I think last time you had mentioned that about two thirds of the 2015 income was hedged at a rate of JPY107 to the dollar. But I wanted to see if there's a change in that.
John Hele: Let me do the -- it is John. Let me do the Japan hedges first. We've actually increased our hedges. So we're now a 100%, and for 2015 the strike is at 107. And we've extended it out to 2016 as at 108, and the 2017 is at 122. And we've fully hedged all Yen earnings from Japan.
Jimmy Bhullar: Through 2017? Fully hedged through 2017, you said?
John Hele: Oh, well, as we get further out, it maybe between 85 to 100.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay.
John Hele: Yes. And I'm sorry, your first question, you wanted interest rates…
Jimmy Bhullar: So just on interest rates, how much of a risk is the current level of rates if we stay here through the end of the year versus your guidance or target that you had assumed of 2.8%, how much of a risk is that to your returns overall?
John Hele: Well, we gave some sensitivities in our 10K. That shows by segment how things moved compared to a stress down compared to what our plan is at. So I would point you towards that. Let me also point out it's not just the long end moving up, we are sensitive a bit to the short end, because we had a very steep short yield curve, and so we benefited over the last few years from better earnings and securities lending. And that's impacted where we have asset intensive businesses in particular. We've seen a benefit from that in CBF over the past few years, maybe slightly higher earnings than people had thought, but that's because the short end of the curve was down. So it really depends on what's going to happen here, but I point you back to the 10K, because there would be some sensitivity there for you to analyze.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And lastly, Steve you mentioned the DoL standard briefly, besides the annuity business, is there risk in other parts of the business because of at least what the preliminary standards look like?
Steve Kandarian: Jimmy, it's largely the annuity business that we're focused on in terms of the DoL rule.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher: Good morning. John, your comment that you're now targeting variable annuity growth of greater than 20% from the old guidance of greater than 50%, what's driving that? Is that DoL fiduciary standards related? Can you give some color there?
Bill Wheeler: Tom, it's Bill, I'll take that one. It doesn't have anything to do with the DoL. It really is just the pace of adoption of the new product versus what we had assumed in our plan for this year. Remember, this is a different type of rider, right? It's not just that we've tweaked the features a little bit. It's the withdrawal benefit versus a GMIB. And so I think that that's causing adoption to be a l slower than we had assumed as producers get more comfortable with the product. We've seen this phenomenon before with our indexed annuity product called Shield. Sales were lower for a while than we had originally thought, and now they are seeming to accelerate now that we have had the product out for a little over a year. And we probably should have been a little smarter about how the pace of adoption here. We do, and I think John alluded to this, we do expect to see increasing sales of FlexChoice in the latter half of 2015.
Tom Gallagher: Okay, and Bill, just a follow-up on that related to DoL, so if the proposal does get past without any we will call it meaningful changes, how big of an impact do you see this being for the VA industry overall from a sales standpoint? Is it a game changer? Do you see it being meaningful or manageable?
Bill Wheeler: It's hard to make that call. It's obviously going to be meaningful. A lot of it will ultimately depend on what exemptions the DoL allows down the road. Remember, a lot of their rulemaking is really built on exemptions to existing policies. And it's hard to know if this is at the end of the day more of a disclosure issue, or how behavior is really going to change.
Tom Gallagher: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Seth Weiss: Hi, thank you, good morning. Steve, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on cash flow and capital. You commented on granular analysis of improving capital characteristics in certain segments. Could you give a little bit more color on some of the specific areas for improvement that you have already identified?
Steve Kandarian: That was still in the early stages of the analysis, and what we'll be doing as a company is looking at various parts of the business, and then making some decisions and tradeoffs, meaning, some parts of the business we'll try to accelerate, other parts of business we'll have to redesign some products to make it more efficient from a cash perspective. So the work that we're doing really is interactive between all parts of the company. And we're not yet at the point where it made found decisions about any one part of out business. So it would be premature for me at this point to say what we'll be doing in terms of specific products, and essentially signal something before we really have completed our analysis. Other companies have engaged in this type of analysis before, and particularly European companies. It was a multiyear process that they went through. We're trying to accelerate that process, kind of learning from what others before us have done to shorten the timeframe, but it's not something that gets done in one or two quarters.
Seth Weiss: Okay, thank you. And then on comments in terms of if SIFI either is overturned or rules come in less onerous than feared you commented on maximizing the balance sheet. Just curious if this specifically means more share repurchases as we all think about it or if there are other tools in terms of maximizing the balance sheet beyond simply share repurchase, increased dividends.
Steve Kandarian: Well, we look at share repurchases, we look at dividends, we look at acquisitions as all valid uses of any excess capital that we hold. And at the point in time when we have greater clarity about the found decision on our judicial appeal in the capital rules for non-bank SIFIs, we'll look at the landscape at that point in time and make a decision about where we utilize our capital.
Seth Weiss: Okay, so this is utilization of capital, not really structure of the balance sheet?
John Hele: Hi, Seth this is John. It may also be how we think about our balance sheet. We have been over the past few years essentially de-leveraging. We've had less debt equity ratios. And that's been improving each and every period. And the question will be if we were free of the SIFI, what is the best balance sheet, and that could include debt, it include preferreds. I mean we have to rethink all that. We've been conservative so far. So we have maximum flexibility kind of what the SIFI rules are, because there could be Tier II, and it could be more complex, and might be different, so that we've been deliberately being a little underlevered [ph] compared to some of our targets, so that we have this flexibility. But when we're out of this one way or the other we'll optimize our balance sheet for the best returns, for the shareholder with a conservative for our safety for all of our customers.
Seth Weiss: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Hi, thank you. Can you talk a little bit more about the sales trends in Latin America? It looks like even adjusting for the Mexico Group case growth has slowed a bit there. And maybe also put into context how much the U.S. Direct business is contributing to sales?
Bill Wheeler: Yes, sure. Erik, it's Bill, I'd hate to just look at any one quarter and add a context in Latin America, and say, "Geez, it's look like things are slowing down." I don't really think that's the case. For instance, the sales were a little suppressed this quarter relative to what we would normally expect our sales growth is. But if you look underneath, what you'll see is our Mexican AFORE, which is the private pension system in Mexico is, sales are much lower there. There have been certain sales practice changes, which makes switching between accounts much less prevalent for AFORE providers. And so gross sales, I'd say, are much lower, but at the same time retention rates are higher. Maybe a better indicator of sort of what's really going on in Mexico or in Latin America is just PFOs. On a constant rate, PFO growth this quarter was 13%. And that's right where we would expect it to be. Things will move up and down in Latin America over time, but I'd say the growth trend is still in place.
Erik Bass: Got it. And then on the Direct side or that's probably still small piece of sales now, but if you can talk about how that's trending? I think you said that the level of investment spending will go down in the second half of the year and then obviously off the variable cost as sales come through.
Bill Wheeler: Yes, so Direct is a start-up. It's still I'd say this is a -- I'd call this is a transitional quarter in that we had some small reserve adjustments. They had a couple of bad homeowner's claims. We do sell Auto and Homeowners direct through that channel. And we clearly had some growth strain, because year-over-year premium growth or sales growth is 70%, which obviously I don't think we're going to continue to grow at that rate, but we're growing this business. We think that in the second half of the year there will still be operating losses, but they will be much less than what we reported in the second quarter. And the other thing I'd say is this business is just -- if the model is coming together in that, we're seeing our mortality experience begin to improve, our retention rates are beginning to improve, so I think the trends are all in the right direction.
Erik Bass: All right, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
John Nadel: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Bill, just a follow-up on a response to an earlier question about increasing competitive pressure in the Group Insurance side, I think you mentioned certain segments -- is it fair to assume that you're talking about the large case market given that's where I think Met's prevalence is, or is there more to add there?
Bill Wheeler: Yes, well, I think I talked about the Dental business. Dental business is actually, well, what we would mid case. I think the rest of the industry calls that large case, but we're talking under between 1000 and 5000 lives. We're seeing just a little context here, John. MET is the largest for-profit dental insurer provider in the United States. So we're the market share leader. People come at us from time to time. We're currently seeing that in the mid-market. We tend to just be very disciplined about this. Dental margins are generally pretty thin to begin with. So we'll let that business go, and it will probably come back around within a year or two.
John Nadel: Got it. And then bigger picture on the Group Insurance side, you guys are the largest non-medical insurer in the U.S. I think by just about any metric. I'm curious what opportunities do you believe may develop given the ongoing consolidation that we're seeing amongst the largest medical insurers in the US. Are you seeing any ramifications from that currently in the market? And I guess over the next couple of years as this all figures its way out do you think it will result in any strategic opportunities for MET including the potential to acquire non-medical operations from these medical providers?
Bill Wheeler: Well, most of these big medical carriers do sell life, disability, dental, and it's a bit of a -- it's obviously not the remaining focus. So the logic has always been maybe they'll as they continue to get more focus on the medical side of the benefits equation that they'll potentially divest. We haven't really seen much of that happen, though that's always been the theory. So I guess the potential is always there that there might be some strategic opportunities, but I think we're just going to have to wait and see.
John Nadel: Okay, so nothing yet. And in terms of the immediate response in the market, is there anything really coming up as a result of this?
Bill Wheeler: No, other than I think the intermediaries are all very distracted right now dealing with all the consolidation both in health insurance and in commercial line.
Q –John Nadel: Got it, thank you. And then just a real quick one for you, Steve; given Bill's retirement next month, I was wondering if you could update us on what kind of management structure you expect to have in place over the Americas.
Steve Kandarian: John, we haven't made any decisions on that.
John Nadel: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jay Gelb: Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts on potentially reinsuring out guaranteed living benefits on the variable annuity portfolio given what we've seen in terms of trends in the marketplace among some other major annuity writers.
John Hele: Hi, Jay, it's John. So up till now the deals that have been done have been on WBs not on IBs. So much of our in-force, and we had been selling until recently are IBs. We look and evaluate these. I think they share 50% of the risk to the reinsurer on this. And of course we're always evaluating the cost benefit of all of these ideas. We haven't done a transaction as of yet.
Jay Gelb: Okay. And then a separate issue for you, John. How should we think about the share count for the full year? So if you make a simplifying assumption that there's no more share buybacks for the remainder of 2015, can you given the exercise or issuance of stock-based compensation where would you see share count ending out for the year on a fully diluted basis?
John Hele: Well, I think if you go back over the past years and look at the issuance of share account and the timing of that by quarter to see how the large amounts are exercised and are issued for our employee benefit programs, and of course individual exercising is hard to predict, if that makes some material difference, usually it doesn't. And then we've got any buyback activity, which again Steve's mention would be reevaluated and looked at and discussed with the board this fall. But you can look back to historical patterns. I don't have it at the top of my head. But you can see it year-by-year.
Jay Gelb: It's typically way towards 4Q, right?
John Hele: I don't think so, I think it will be more in the first half of the year when we do our big awards, but again, you just go back and check. You can see it quarter-by-quarter.
Jay Gelb: Will do. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning. Steve, you had mentioned looking at free cash flow optimization and I guess considering the fact that we've seen a lot of appetite coming in from overseas insurers for U.S. businesses. Would you consider selling U.S. businesses if you deemed them not free cash flow friendly or not free cash flow oriented?
Steve Kandarian: Well, again Yaron, we haven't made any firm decisions, but everything is on the table in terms of how does analysis comes out. Certain things will want to do more of. Some things will do less of. Some businesses will have to redesign their products. And we don't rule out selling businesses.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And then you had mentioned that Dental utilization was a bit high in the second quarter just catching up on weather in the first quarter. I think that last year we saw a similar pattern but that also [technical difficulty] where utilization was still a little bit high. Do you see that being the case this year again?
Steve Kandarian: Yaron, I'm not sure if it will or not. It looks very similar to the experience we had last year, where of course we had two bad winters in a row. I will say this Dental utilization if you look at the first six months is right on plan. And so my expectation is that it will –-- the third quarter will probably moderate. But you can't get surprised here a little bit.
Q –Yaron Kinar: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kovac from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Kovac: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wondering going back to the Department of Labor fiduciary standards, if the rule is passed in a way that it looks today what sort of impacts would you expect on the way that you compensate producers for variable annuities that you're selling? And then also on that can you give us a sense of the percent of variable annuities that you sell in retirement versus non-retirement?
Bill Wheeler: Sure. I think what you meant in your second question is how much your variable annuities do you sell on qualified plans. It's all retirement, right?
Michael Kovac: That's right.
Bill Wheeler: But it's about 70% of our VAs today are sold in group qualified assets. And so it's an issue for us. Today we have already changed our compensation policies a couple of years ago to, I'd say, equalize comp between proprietary and non-proprietary annuities for our producers. That's kind of a bridge we've already crossed. With that said, we might still have to make other compensation adjustments to our producers based on how the DoL rule comes out. But I think we feel like we've already made -- we've already climbed part way up that hill.
Michael Kovac: Great, thanks. And then John mentioned conversion of a securities accounting system contributed about I think five basis points was the number. Can you describe in a little more detail what's going on there and if there's any continuation from that going forward?
John Hele: Hi, this is John. Yes, we convert over to a new accounting system from investment portfolio. And we do it for the U.S. portfolio this past quarter. As you can imagine with the size of our U.S. portfolio, small little rounding and different slight different impacts in amortization can have an impact. The impact we mention this quarter is a one-time event.
Michael Kovac: Great, thanks.
Operator:
. :
Sean Dargan: Yes, thanks and good morning. I just want to come back to the DoL proposal one more time. And I'm just wondering what the proposal if enacted as proposed would do to lapsation rates in variable annuities? And where I'm going with this is that perhaps contract holders are not turned into new contracts when the penalty period expires as often. Is that something that you're concerned about?
Steve Kandarian: We probably have mixed feelings about that, Sean. Obviously we like, as a general rule, we like low lapse rates. There is some of the in-force where the guarantees are relatively high, and some of our competitors from time to time have actually tried to buy out that business with policyholders. We've not done that by the way. A little bit of it will depend I think in terms of the macroeconomic factors. If interest rates go up, we feel a lot better about our GMIB in-force. And I'd think in general we would then think lower lapse rates would be a pretty clear in that positive for the annuity business for Met. So I don't think that's going to be a big driver for us. I don't that will end up being much of an issue.
Sean Dargan: Okay, thanks. And just one follow-up about your focus on cash and cash flow generation, is that at odds or is that on the same page with how the Fed is thinking to the extent that you've had discussions with the Fed about your strategy to focus on cash flow?
Steve Kandarian: This is unrelated to the Fed.
Sean Dargan: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Lee: Thanks, good morning. Just a question about the spread compression that we're seeing in annuities, the base spread came down around 27 basis points and my understanding is that's in part because of some of the interest rate protection rolled off in the quarter. How should we think about the rolling off schedule of your interest rate hedges and this kind of 20 basis point impacts that we've seen in the second quarter would that be an ongoing thing? I guess in a sense how are those kind of interest rate hedges contracts were staggered throughout over the next several years?
Bill Wheeler: Humphrey, I apologize. I'm not sure I got all your question, but I think I got the just of it. So yes, there was an investment margin decline in the annuity business this quarter. And yes, it was driven by the maturity of a particular interest rate floor. MET had well over a decade ago, or roughly a decade ago had invested a lot of interest rate floors for just the kind of scenario that we've gone through. Those are starting to mature now, and therefore -- because interest rates are still low, our margins are starting to decline as they lapse. So we had a decent-sized one that was supporting the annuity business lapses mature this quarter. So that investment margin that we lost there is permanent, right? It's not going to come back. And these things will continue to mature over the next number of years. So depending on what happens to interest rates that will obviously -- could have an impact on our interest margins in another part of the company.
Humphrey Lee: So you've had [technical difficulty] matured in this quarter but [technical difficulty] going to be every quarter we'll see a 20 basis point impact but more like depending on the schedule. And then in that case can you maybe give us a sense of how like when will we see maybe another big one that will be maturing?
Bill Wheeler: I don't remember when the next one comes. We know there's not another one coming up this year, for instance. There's not going to be any more maturities of floors coming up this year I think. I can't quite recall when the next one is coming up.
Humphrey Lee: Okay, thanks. And then, just one quick follow-up on John's comment earlier about high expenses in the quarter related to regulatory expenses. Can you give us a sense of how much was that in the quarter?
Steve Kandarian: Well, as I said about, half of the higher ratio was due to lower PFOs and single premium sales, and either half was due to expenses.
Humphrey Lee: But in terms of that expenses is what portion is related to regulatory-related expenses versus other things?
Steve Kandarian: There were some pieces within that, and they're all split between three different items.
Humphrey Lee: Okay, thanks.
Ed Spehar: Okay. We are past the top of the hours. Thank you very much for your participation. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligations to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Edward A. Spehar - Head-Investor Relations, MetLife, Inc.: Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now let me call to your attention four new disclosures in our quarterly financial supplement this quarter. First, expenses and sales for our non-US businesses, Latin America, Asia and EMEA. Second, business segment returns on both allocated and tangible equity as discussed on our December outlook call. Third, operating earnings and premiums, fees and other revenues on a constant currency basis. And four, an earnings (02:30) table for corporate and other, which was previously only available in our 10-Q and 10-K filings. We believe these additional disclosures provide greater transparency for our businesses and address some of the questions that we have received from the investor community in the past. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report good results for the first quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 4.8% from the first quarter of 2014. And operating earnings per share were $1.44, a 5.1% increase over the prior year period. Growth in the quarter was dampened by broad-based weakness in foreign currencies. Premiums, fees, and other revenues, or PFOs, were essentially flat versus the prior year but up 4% on a constant currency basis. In Latin America, reported PFOs were flat versus the prior year but up 13% on a constant currency basis. And in Asia, reported PFOs were down 6% but up 6% on a constant currency basis. Earnings were also negatively impacted by the strong dollar. Operating earnings grew 5% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis. We believe MetLife's global platform should deliver attractive growth and returns over time, but currency translation can be a source of volatility. The increase in operating earnings in the quarter was driven by business growth and a rebound in underwriting margins. As you may recall, underwriting margins were below normal in the prior year period. Investment margins remain healthy in the quarter with an average investment spread of 211 basis points for U.S. product lines. However, the spread was at the low end of the 210 to 240 basis point range of the past few years. Margin pressure from low interest rates was only partially offset by variable investment income. Expenses as a percentage of PFOs continue to trend downward. The operating expense ratio was 23.5% in the first quarter versus 24.1% in the prior year period. Our goal is to grow overall revenues at a faster rate than expenses, and we have sharpened our focus on expense control to help offset the drag on earnings in the current economic environment. However, we will not forego the investments necessary to become a more customer-centric company simply to boost GAAP earnings in the near term. Accordingly, we plan to reinvest $225 million this year to modernize the company's infrastructure and make it easier for customers to do business with us. We believe these improvements will generate additional savings and make customers more willing to recommend us to others. Just as becoming customer-centric is a key element of our strategy, so too is growing sales of capital efficient, protection-oriented products. We made good progress on this initiative in the first quarter. For example, accident and health sales outside the U.S. increased by 24%. Involuntary accident and health and non-life product sales in the U.S. grew by 57%. I would now like to discuss return on equity. Operating ROE was 11.7% in the quarter and tangible ROE was 14.4%. However, low interest rates and the impact of regulatory uncertainty in capital management are challenges for ROE going forward. I want to remind you what we have said over the past three years about return on equity and provide you an updated outlook. We introduced our new strategic plan in May 2012 with a 2016 operating ROE goal of 12% to 14%. Since that time, we have provided sensitivities for ROE related to interest rates and share repurchases. We have said that persistent low interest rates would bring down our 2016 operating ROE to the low end of our 12% to14% range. Unfortunately, the 10-year Treasury yield has averaged 2.2% since May 2012 and our current plan assumes rates rising less than we initially assumed. We have also said that our strategic plan contemplated $8 billion of share repurchases from 2012 to 2016 and that no buybacks over this period would reduce ROE by 100 basis points. We have been cautious on share repurchases because capital requirements remain unknown for non-bank, systemically important financial institutions. We have not yet seen draft capital rules, and there is no clarity on when those rules will be issued. As a result, it is likely that share repurchases will be substantially lower than we had assumed in our strategic plan. In the first quarter, we completed the $1 billion buyback program announced in December 2014. As an opportunistic buyer, we took advantage of price weakness to aggressively repurchase shares at an average price of $49.56 per share. Given regulatory uncertainty, our overall approach to share repurchases remains conservative. Since May 2012, buybacks have totaled $2 billion, or one-fourth of the total contemplated in our 2016 ROE target. Below-plan M&A activity has also had a negative impact on returns. The acquisitions we have made have contributed approximately $200 million to earnings, or half of what was contemplated in our strategic plan. MetLife has consistently been a disciplined buyer, and we will not relax our acquisition standards simply to boost ROE in the short term. The 10-year Treasury yield has been hovering around 2%, the regulatory environment remains uncertain, and it is unlikely that M&A will contribute as much to earnings as we had hoped. With only eight months to go until 2016, we believe it is appropriate to reflect these realities in the ROE outlook. As a result, we estimate that MetLife's operating ROE will be approximately 11% next year. An 11% operating ROE would mean a return that is approximately 9 percentage points above the current 10-year Treasury yield. A 9 percentage point spread over the 10-year would be close to the pre-financial crisis levels, while the quality of MetLife's ROE has improved, largely due to lower leverage and derisking in the U.S. business. Despite macro and regulatory challenges, we are optimistic about MetLife's prospects. This optimism is underscored by our board's willingness to increase the common stock dividend. As you know, on April 28, we announced a 7% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend per share. With this increase, our annual common stock dividend will be $1.50 per share, and based on MetLife's current share price, the dividend yield will be 2.9%. We have now raised the common stock dividend for three consecutive years, resulting in a cumulative increase of 103%. Going forward, it is our goal to increase the common stock dividend as our earnings grow. Turning to regulatory issues, I would like to begin by restating one of the core principles that guides our thinking on these matters. Simply put, it is that regulators should preserve a level playing field for all of the companies in the life insurance industry. Regulators in the United States and Europe correctly point out the virtues of competition in an antitrust context. We believe that same commitment to robust competition should apply to insurance regulation, and for the same reason. Competition provides consumers with the best products at the best prices. We were pleased when the Federal Reserve recently made clear that it will develop a single capital standard for all of the insurance companies it supervises through a formal rule-making process. If the Fed had elected to establish prudential standards for insurers by order rather than by rule, the result could've been different orders for different companies, with potentially harmful effects on competition. Developing capital standards through a rule-making process will address one threat to competition by holding all federally-regulated insurance companies to the same standard. However, there's still a risk that these additional capital rules for federally-regulated insurers will put them at a competitive disadvantage to companies regulated exclusively at the state level. So it will be important for regulators to ensure consistency across multiple and potentially conflicting capital regimes. In closing, MetLife had a good quarter, especially considering the pressure from low rates and the strong dollar. Looking forward, we believe MetLife will continue to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns on equity. Finally, I am pleased that we have been able to offer higher current income to shareholders by more than doubling our common stock dividend over the past three years. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses, and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. Operating earnings in the first quarter were $1.6 billion and $1.44 per share, both up 5% from the prior year period and 10% on a constant currency basis. This quarter included one notable item in our P&C business. We had higher than budgeted catastrophe experience, partially offset by favorable prior-year development, which decreased operating earnings by $16 million, or $0.01 per share. Adjusting for the notable items in both periods, as disclosed in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement, or QFS, operating earnings were up 6% year-over-year and 11% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were business growth and underwriting improvement, partially offset by lower variable and recurring investment income. Turning to our bottom-line results. First quarter net income was $2.1 billion, or $1.87 per share. Net income was $490 million, above operating earnings in the quarter. Three items that explain most of this difference are, number one, derivative net gains of $394 million after-tax, which reflects changes in foreign currencies and gains from lower interest rates. Number two, investment portfolio net gains of $113 million after-tax, as credit-related losses continue to be modest in the portfolio. And these were partially offset by, number three, charges of $35 million after-tax associated with insurance contracts and other market value adjustments. Of the total $490 million difference between operating earnings and net income, we attribute $455 million to asymmetrical accounting and noneconomic adjustments. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $50.45 at March 31, up 6% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $41.32 at March 31, up 9% year-over-year. With respect to first quarter margins, underwriting results improved year-over-year by approximately $0.05 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. This was primarily due to improved mortality and morbidity experience in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, as well as better underwriting in Corporate Benefit Funding. These favorable results were partially offset by adverse claims experienced in Retail Life. Retail Life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 59.3%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 56.9%. Results this quarter were negatively impacted by higher than normal accidental deaths, particularly accidental falls, which we believe is related to this adverse winter weather. The Group Life mortality ratio, which now includes AD&D, was 90.7% in the quarter. This was favorable to the prior year quarter of 91.9%, driven primarily by lower Term Life claim severity. The Group Life mortality ratio is seasonally high in the first quarter. Therefore, we would expect the mortality ratio to be toward the top end of the 85% to 90% annual range. The non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio, which now excludes AD&D, was 77.0%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 79.9% and at the low end of the targeted 77% to 82% range. Dental had favorable margins compared to the prior year and plan due to lower utilization. We believe lower utilization was a function of adverse winter weather and anticipate some increase in utilization similar to what we saw last year. Disability was in line with the prior year period, and we expect improvement for the balance of the year. In property and casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 89.3% in Retail and 101.2% in Group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 79.4% in Retail and 89.7% in Group. The more favorable Retail P&C combined ratio reflects less exposure to the Northeast, which experienced particularly severe winter weather. Overall, P&C underwriting results were favorable versus the prior year due to lower non-CAT losses, partially offset by higher CATs. Turning to investment margins, please note annuity spreads in the QFS are now based on total annuities. The total annuities spread, which includes deferred annuities and single-premium immediate annuities, better depicts investment margins for the business than our prior disclosure of deferred annuities only. While investment margins have been resilient, we have seen some modest decline in spreads. The average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 211 basis points in the quarter, down 17 basis points year-over-year and one basis point sequentially. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 181 basis points, down six basis points versus the prior year and two basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower variable investment income and core yields. Pre-tax variable investment income was $371 million, within our 2015 quarterly guidance range of $325 million to $425 million. After taxes and the impact of DAC, VII was $241 million, down $33 million versus the prior year due to weaker private equity returns, partially offset by higher prepays. Core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average new money yields are running roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average yield on assets rolling off the portfolio. With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.1% and slightly favorable to 23.6% after adjusting for a legal settlement with New York in the first quarter of 2014. Gross expense saves were $244 million in the first quarter and net saves were $180 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $31 million and one-time cost of $33 million. I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Please note that our segment earnings in the current and prior year period reflected the changes discussed on our December outlook call. Retail operating earnings were $653 million, up 3% versus the prior year quarter and up 8% after adjusting for notable items. Growth in Retail was driven by favorable separate account performance in annuities and partially offset by unfavorable underwriting in Life. Life and other reported operating earnings of $203 million, down 20% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were tighter core spreads, higher corporate expenses, and lower closed block earnings. Underwriting, while below expectations, was only modestly unfavorable to the prior year quarter as adverse mortality and life was mostly offset by favorable P&C experience. Life and other PFOs were $2.0 billion, essentially flat year-over-year as growth in the open block was partially offset by the runoff of the closed block. Core Retail Life sales were up 23% year-over-year, driven by increases in Whole Life and Term. The performance this quarter supports our view that Life sales bottomed in 2014. Annuities reported operating earnings of $450 million, up 18% versus the prior year quarter and 22% after adjusting for excess variable investment income in the prior year. This strong performance was primarily due to separate account returns, which were 2.7% in the quarter and lower expenses. Variable annuity sales were flat year-over-year. As you know, we introduced our new VA-guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, on February 17. As the application process is typical for one month VAs, FlexChoice had little impact on first quarter results. GVWB reported operating earnings of $228 million, up 20% versus the prior year quarter and 27% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in the quarter was driven by underwriting improvement in most products. GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 3% year-over-year, and sales increased 5% due to strong growth in voluntary products. Voluntary sales accounted for 16% of GVWB sales in the first quarter of 2015, and we would expect this percentage to grow from this level. Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $369 million, up 9% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and business growth. CBF PFOs were $543 million, up 27% year-over-year due to pension closeout and structured settlements. On closeouts, we continue to see a good pipeline of small to mid-sized cases. Latin America reported operating earnings of $131 million, down 17% from the prior year quarter and 3% on a constant currency basis. Business growth and underwriting improvement were offset by lower inflation, higher taxes, and higher expenses in U.S. Direct. Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter and up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth across the region. Sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by Brazil, Mexico, and U.S. Direct. Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $327 million, down 2% from the prior year quarter and up 8% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth. Additionally, effective April 1, 2015, the government of Japan enacted a tax reform plan that would lower the Japanese tax rate by approximately 2%. As a result, the company expects to record a one-time benefit of $170 million to $180 million, which includes an increase in Asia's second quarter operating earnings by approximately $60 million. In addition, we expect this tax law change will favorably affect our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2015 by approximately 0.2% as compared to 2014. Asia PFOs were $2.2 billion, down 6% from the prior year quarter but up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth and solid persistency in core markets. Asia sales were 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by a 32% increase in accident and health sales in Japan. In EMEA, operating earnings were $70 million, down 1% but up 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth as well as favorable underwriting and lower expenses, both of which were better than expected for the quarter. Going forward, we believe underwriting margins and expenses will be closer to expectations. EMEA PFOs were $629 million, down 14% from the prior year period but up 2% on a constant currency basis. PFO growth was dampened by certain product and accounting reclassifications in 2014, which had no bottom-line impact to earnings but did impact the growth rate. Adjusting for that, underlying PFO growth was approximately 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong employee benefit sales in the last two quarters. Total EMEA sales increased 14% on a constant currency basis due to strong growth in employee benefits and A&H sales. As Steve noted, we had strong growth in A&H. In the quarter, A&H sales outside the U.S. were $1.2 billion, which was 23% of total combined sales in Latin America, Asia, and EMEA. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.7 billion at March 31. This amount reflects the completion of our buyback program, the issuance of senior debt to fund an upcoming debt maturity, cash contributions to our life insurance captives, which we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, and the payment of our quarterly common dividend. Turning to our capital position, the combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding Alico, at year-end 2014 was 410%. Also, our Japan solvency ratio was 1036% as of December 31. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.2 billion and statutory net income was approximately $1.3 billion. Statutory operating earnings were up 53% from the restated prior year quarter, primarily due to separate account returns and improved underwriting. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of March 31, up 7% from December 31. In conclusion, MetLife had a good first quarter. Investment margins remained healthy despite pressure from low rates. Expenses are well-controlled, and underwriting improved for the third consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong, and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: And our first question will come from Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to just ask some questions on the updated guidance, first, the new 11% guidance for 2016. In terms of a interest rate assumption, does this contemplate the 3.5% yield that you assume is part of your business plan for 2016, that you've laid out in the 10-K? Or does it assume flat interest rates through the end of the year – or through the end of 2016?
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Seth. We've assumed lower rates, as I mentioned, than our original plan that we put out in 2012. For 2015, we're assuming 2.46% for the 10-year Treasury and for 2016, 3.11%.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. And if we think about also M&A, you mentioned that accretion from M&A was roughly half of what was assumed back in that original plan. When we think about more limited M&A than what was planned, is this a function of the regulatory uncertainty or a function of availability of opportunities in the market?
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: The main thing is remaining a disciplined buyer. The regulatory uncertainty has some impact upon that as well, in the sense that, as a designated non-bank SIFI, we're mindful of considerations, in terms of that designation, related to our business model. So there's some things we'd probably be less likely to pursue in that environment than if that environment didn't exist. But the main reason why we did not, to-date, acquire businesses with earnings of the $400 million we were assuming in our original plan of 2012, really relates to being a disciplined buyer, looking at the marketplace. We've reviewed a number of transactions that were of interest to us, but the pricing that was attractive to us to move forward on did not ultimately end up being the pricing that the transactions went for. They went for higher numbers. So that's the main driver there. And let me just mention, on the interest rate numbers I gave you, those were year-end assumptions for the 10-year Treasury.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. My first question is just on capital deployment. And I think, Steve, you had mentioned last time on the call that you, given the regulatory uncertainty, might not consider doing an immediate buyback after the current one at the time had been completed. So now that it's done, what's your view on potential buybacks through the remainder of the year? Are you ruling those out, or would you still consider them at some point later this year?
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Jimmy, we have not made a decision yet as to whether or not we would do more share repurchases this calendar year. What I said before is that the most recent program was completed more rapidly than we anticipated, because we were buying more shares at – when the price of our stock was lower, below certain levels. So that program concluded more rapidly than we had anticipated, and we're going to take a pause for a while and reassess things further on in the year.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then, just one question on the Japan business. You had pretty strong sales in A&H. Can you discuss what drove this? Is it the new products you introduced last year, or something else? And to what extent do you view the results as an ongoing trend versus an aberration?
Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region: So, yes, Chris Townsend here. The A&H results for Japan were up 32%, and that helped lift all of Asia, from an A&H perspective, up 25% for the quarter. So we did bring in new products called Flexi Plus and Flexi Gold (34:08) a little over six months ago, and the performance has been very strong since we launched those products. So we expect to see continued good growth through the second and third quarter, but the fourth quarter will be more challenging from a comparison perspective, because we had a very strong fourth quarter 2014, given that we launched these products right at the start of that fourth quarter.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Steve, just one question. Why the update on the ROE guidance right now? Is it simply you're close enough to 2016 or – I'm just curious, why now? That's the first question.
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Tom, I think you answered it. We are now only eight months away from the start of 2016. And we have more visibility, obviously, not only to this year, but our 2016 plan and, given where rates are, given our view of where rates are likely to be, given the M&A issue I'd mentioned before, given what's realistic in terms of share repurchases in the current environment related to our SIFI designation. As you rerun those numbers, staying in that 12% to 14% range, it doesn't look likely. And certainly, analysts on the Street have already baked that into their projections for 2016 ROE. I think the average that we've seen out there is 11.1% for 2016 ROE for MetLife. So I think it's pretty well understood how the math works, given all these factors, most of which are not within our control here at MetLife.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Right. And I guess, Steve, that was going to be my point, too. I was just looking at where consensus numbers are, and I think most people have figured that out. So it clearly doesn't look like that estimates look out of whack. But the other question, just as a follow-up to that, did you say the interest rate assumption for year-end 2015 is 2.46% and year-end 2016 is 3.11%? Those are year-end figures?
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I have to correct myself. Those are actually average 10-year rates.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Those are average 10-year rates. And then, one, my follow-up is, I guess for Chris Townsend. Your strong Japan sales, particularly in A&H, was followed by – Aflac also had very strong A&H sales growth as well. Is the A&H market growing again? Or are you all taking share from the domestic competitors? Can you give a little color for what's happening there?
Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region: Sure. The products we launched were launched after fairly detailed customer insights, so they're pretty focused customer-centric products. They're effectively hospital cash products with a range of surgical benefits and the way they work is that we have some very low-cost options for certain types of customers and we have some products, which are more appropriate for the more discerning customer, which have some more specialized covers of. So I think the products are fairly broad in terms of their offering, which helps to drive growth overall. So probably the market for the A&H business is growing at about 3% to 5% overall. So as have been indicated, we've got well-positioned products which we're distributing through that multichannel approach which we've spoken to you about previously.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And not a sense for whether it's coming from share – share is being taken from the domestics or otherwise?
Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region: Yes, I think the market's grown probably about 3% to 5%. We're clearly outpacing that growth at the moment, but they're a new range of product. So we're comfortable with where we're at and we'll continue to drive pretty good growth out of these products for the rest of the year.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks.
Operator: And our next question will come from Erik Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about capital return relative to the free cash flow that you're generating? And should we view all free cash flow generated as being potentially available for redeployment? Or does your ROE guidance assume that there's some additional capital build at the holdco?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So this is John. And we view, ultimately, other than an appropriate buffer at the holding company when we find out what the capital rules are, that we will be living under, that that would be truly free cash flow. It is for common dividends, for buybacks or for acquisitions. So that's why we're quantifying that for you now on a regular basis, and once we finally know the capital rules, we can come up with an appropriate capital management plan.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. But I guess your revised ROE guidance, does that assume that there is further capital build at the holdco?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We are assuming a consistent conservative nature of capital in our projections.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then maybe one question just quickly on Latin America. Can you quantify the size of the loss related to the U.S. Direct business? And how we should think about the investment being made there in 2015?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division: Sure. Erik, this is Bill Wheeler. So remember, our U.S. Direct business is now being reported inside the Latin American segment. And the total loss for the quarter was up about $6 million year-over-year, $5 million I guess. Just keep in mind that that's different. We've now – all the direct activities that MetLife was pursuing in the U.S. are now pulled together under one management organization and being reported in Latin America. So that was a small reason for the decline in Latin American performance. But we expect losses in that segment as we're sort of investing in growth for the remainder of 2015. Sales growth is very good there, and we don't have the ability to capitalize the acquisition cost quite like we do in our more traditional businesses.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Would you expect the kind of expenses to continue at a similar run rate or increase as sales volumes pick up?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division: My guess is, if anything, they'll decline a little bit in terms of – the acquisition costs will be steady, I think, throughout the year. But the bottom line losses will probably drop a little bit.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. The $225 million of reinvestment spend that Steve mentioned, is that in addition to the $400 million per year that you've already guided to? Or is that part of the $400 million?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That is within – this is John. That was within the $400 million long-term that we're seeking for.
Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And then on the interest rate assumptions, you gave the 10-year assumption. I assume there's also some change in the shape of the yield curve which could impact your Corporate Benefit Funding business? Can you give any color there on what you're assuming?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We haven't given exact details, but we are assuming a flattening of the curve. If you look at – we based most of this on consensus outlooks, and you see the short end coming up throughout the next 18 months or so, up to the end of 2016.
Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And then last one if I could just revisit the question I asked last quarter now that the year-end statutory statements are finalized, you've been talking about the statutory capital impact over the last couple of years from being domiciled in New York. Can you give us any more detail on what the cumulative statutory capital or RBC impact has been to MetLife from the stricter New York insurance rules?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. This is John. For those of you who enjoy reading blue books, you'll see on page 19 of MetLife Insurance Company, there's a table that lists versus NAIC with the prescribed practices required by New York create the difference in reserves. And there's about a $1 billion difference between those two printed numbers. However, if you look at, as we've analyzed the impact of New York and other requirements that they request we follow, the total number is actually $3 billion difference in statutory reserves. This would include about $700 million in reserves because of the fact we did not use life captives. So that's within that $3 billion. The other point I would tell you on this is that the $3 billion difference in statutory reserves has very little tax impact, not very tax effective reserves.
Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Very helpful.
Operator: And our next question will come from Sean Dargan with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks. Looking at the group non-medical health loss ratio, 77%, I'm wondering how LTC did within that business. Was the, I guess, underwriting performance in line or better than you would've expected?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division: Sean, it's Bill Wheeler. Yes, LTC did perform better than expected. That was one reason that medical health overall loss ratio, 77%, was quite good. I think another, probably equally important reason is dental utilization. If you recall last year, the first quarter because of bad weather, we saw low utilization in the dental area, and then a catch-up for the remainder of the year. And I think it's going to happen the same way this year, where we saw low utilization because of poor weather, especially here in the Northeast. And there'll probably be a catch-up for the remainder of the year. So that's – look, I think the ratio would've been – the non-medical health ratio would've been good in any case. But these are the two factors that made it especially good.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And just one follow-up on LTC in terms of maybe some strategic options because you did write all that business out of a New York company and you're probably better reserved than most, and we saw a private capital transaction recently for an LTC block. Is this something that you would consider selling even if maybe the purchase price wasn't particularly high just to make it go away and never have to talk about it again?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division: Well, I would never exclude anything. I wouldn't put anything off the table. But I don't think that's likely or in the cards. Our block is significant. That transaction was quite small. And there's a lot of – in terms of if you think about price increases that we've been asking for through the state regulatory process, we're having a lot of success there. That's helping the block become I think more attractive over time, and so there's a lot of state of play there. And I wouldn't expect us to leave that on the table and transact anytime soon.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: All right. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from the Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So first question going back to the ROE target, the revised ROE target, now as it pertains to M&A, so I just want to clarify the $200 million of earnings as opposed to the $400 million that was expected, that is from M&A that was expected from 2012 on, so it has no bearing on the Alico acquisition or how that's performed?
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That's correct.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay.
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We were assuming $400 million of additional earnings by 2016 from acquisitions when we put the plan together in 2012.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And, Steve, you said that the non-bank SIFI designation has maybe dampened the appetite for some deals that you would've otherwise considered or some businesses you would've otherwise considered. Can you give us maybe a couple of examples of businesses that you find less attractive with this designation?
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I won't give you specific examples, but you can imagine things that would be considered in the process of designating a company as a SIFI, those kinds of factors went into our thinking in terms of what we would consider acquiring, and there were certain businesses and blocks of businesses that were for sale, particularly in the United States, that we were impacted by that factor.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And last question, Steve, given that the initial target of 12% to 14% by the end of 2016 has come up against a few headwinds that were clearly not foreseen in the beginning of 2012, have you and the board, have you had any discussions over the retirement age of 65, which I think would've probably brought to a change at the helm around the end of 2016? Have you considered maybe extending your tenure?
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: The policy you're referring to is a internal policy for senior management, executive management of age 65. Again, it's not in our bylaws, so it's something the board could waive if it chose to do so but no decisions have been made.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey. Thank you. Just on buybacks and kind of the regulatory piece. I understand the comments that your authorization's complete because you still are unsure what will happen with the rules. But I guess the question is, aren't things kind of going in the right direction? You got the Collins fix, the bank-centric draft rule that was a risk seems off the table now from the Fed. It seems like it's possible you're not going to know what these final rules are for some time, so I'd be interested in getting a sense of your increased confidence to maybe have to make decisions on capital deployment if you don't have kind of a final answer on the rules maybe by the end of this year.
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That has factored into our thinking to date. In other words, we had said we weren't going to do repurchases several years ago when SIFI designation was still being determined for us. And then because the rules were delayed in terms of being promulgated by the Fed, we took actions in two separate cases of each $1 billion of share repurchases. And we did that because the timeframe had shifted on us in terms of our expectations of knowing the rules. So I've said this before, it's art more than science when you don't know what the numbers are going to be, and there's no indications that you can rely upon in terms of what the capital standards ultimately are that you live under. So we have taken I think a measured approach in terms of both share repurchases and the issuance of a higher dividend on our common stock in light of what you just said, which is the delay in the timing that we were all expecting for knowing the rules.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: But I guess the core of the question is, I mean do you think things are going in the right direction? Or are these wins with the Collins fix and kind of making progress with the Fed, is that not material enough to change your decision-making process?
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: The amendment to Dodd-Frank that you're referring to that occurred in December of last year is encouraging. It gives the Fed the flexibility to write rules appropriate for the insurance industry, as opposed to their interpretation of the Collins Amendment, which they thought required them to use no less than bank standards, in this case Basel III standards, even on non-bank SIFIs. So that is encouraging. But all that does is give them the flexibility to write rules they think are appropriate for the insurance industry. We don't know yet what that methodology will be. We don't yet know how those rules may differ from state rules that we live under today. We don't know yet how the rules they come up with may impact us differently than the state rules, because they may look at certain aspects of our balance sheet differently than the state rules than the ASC (51:53) rules look at those assets and liabilities today. So there's no way for us to really have a good estimate of the amount of capital we need to hold under a regime the Fed has yet to put out, even in draft form.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray: Hi. Thanks. I just had one quick question for you this morning. If we look at the core adjusted for unusual items in the annuities segment, the after-tax ROA, if I look back over the past maybe three, four, five quarters, it's been averaging somewhere in the low to mid-70%s. In 1Q, it's – I think if my calculation's correct, it's about 85 or 86 basis points. It's a huge stair-step. Just a question for you, what drove that? Is that sustainable? Is there some outcome there on the expense side or otherwise that we should believe is trendable from here?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division: John, it's Bill Wheeler. So, I wouldn't think that that's a run rate, $450 million of earnings. And there's a couple reasons for that. Annuities had a number of smaller positive factors this quarter. One was separate account performance. Even though the S&P 500 growth was pretty modest this quarter, separate account performance was much stronger. The broader stock indexes did much better. The bond market did much better. Remember, a big percentage of our assets now in the separate accounts are actually fixed income.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray: Yeah.
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division: So separate account performance was 2.4%, and that obviously helped. The second thing is investment spread, you noticed that actually picked up a little bit this quarter, and there were some, I would say, some more unusual investment income which we don't think is repeatable. But there's also – part of the reason the investment margins went up is, when we collapsed our variable annuity captive, or Bermuda captive last year, there was a pool of cash which is now being redeployed into longer-term investments. So yields are up, so that's part of the reason, but the other part is some investment earnings which are not sustainable. So I think the right run rate's a little lower than $450 million, but overall, the annuity business is performing pretty well.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray: Thanks very much.
Operator: And our next question will come from Humphrey Lee with Dowling Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Good morning, guys. Just a quick question on LatAm – in the press release, you mentioned that there's some earnings sensitivity to low inflation, and I was just wondering if you can help us to kind of quantify the impact of low inflation in LatAm, and how that affect the earnings outlook, if inflation remained low in the region?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division: Yeah, so a little background here. Obviously, certain Latin America economies historically have been prone to high levels of inflation, and it's a risk that we need to take into account when we develop an investment strategy in those countries. Because in a couple of countries, we do sell longer-term immediate annuities, especially Chile. And so, in Chile, there is a portfolio of assets where the yields on the bonds is linked to the official inflation rate. And the inflation right now in Chile is quite low, and so that means that the yield on those bonds is near zero, and the overall impact – it was actually probably the biggest driver of under-earning performance in Latin America, was this low-inflation phenomenon. I'm trying to get the exact number here. Well, it's roughly $8 million after-tax, is what it cost us, in terms of the inflation rate in Latin America. So, this isn't just a Chile issue, but it's mainly in Chile.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. And then, in terms of the annuity sales outlook you talked about, there's a little bit of a timing issue when the FlexChoice product was being launched. How (56:30) the application process to date and the overall sales in the second quarter year-to-date, as you reported today, has been trending?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division: Yes, so applications are good. The product is getting good market acceptance. We had forecast, in 2015, a pretty meaningful increase in our annuity business sales, and a piece of that growth was driven by FlexChoice. It wasn't the whole reason for growth, but it was a big piece of it. And so we're seeing apps trending, and we're seeing a lot of good sales coming out of that, and a lot of, I would say, recapturing of sales where our own sales force was selling third-party business and now, instead, they're using FlexChoice as their key living benefit rider product.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: So, no change to your kind of 50% increase for 2015?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division: We still think that's a good projection.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Suneet Kamath with UBS.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could update us on what the current benefit you're getting from the interest rate hedges through – and investment income, and how are you thinking about that trending going forward?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi. This is John. We haven't given out that specific amount. I would say that they've held up quite well historically and into this year. We expect next year to see somewhat of a slight drop-off, but we have hedge protection on this going off well into the next decade, so into the early 2020s timeframe.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then just one more on the ROE. I'm just trying to reconcile the interest rate sensitivity on the ROE to what you have in the 10-K? Maybe I'm not thinking about it right, but if I look at the business plan that you have in your 10-K and where the rates are versus a 2% 10-year Treasury assumption, it looks like a bigger decline, obviously, relative to your current lowered interest rate assumptions, but even if I use that 10-K sensitivity, it seems like you're pointing to an operating earnings impact of $5 million, which for a company of Met's size is de minimis. So I must be missing something on the interest rate sensitivity in terms of why it's putting so much pressure on the ROE.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. So this is John. The 10-K update we give at the end of the year, and that's an outlook, what happens if rates stay kind of at a low level versus what we assume in our plan. Our plan had already been adjusted down, as Steve had indicated, to reflect a lower consensus already. And the other thing that's going on there, which you'll see in the segment sensitivities is compared to our plan, which assumes a more flattening of the yield curve, which reduces sec lending earnings, the scenario that's given assumes a steeper yield curve so the long end stays down but so does the short end, and so that causes a net benefit compared to the plan. So you'll notice that in the sensitivities we give, and CBF is actually a positive in the rest of the plan. So there's really a combination of things. It's a lower long end rate in that sensitivity, but the lower short end rate is a net positive when it comes to the sec lending book of business.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. And then just one quick follow-up for you, John. I think in response to Ryan's question when he was asking about being regulated by the New York regulator, I thought in your comments you had said that part of the differential is that you don't use life captives. Were you specifically referring to the VA or are you talking about XXX and AXXX as well?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That is not including any assumptions for variable annuity captives. It's only life insurance captives for AXXX and XXX.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. So you were just referring to the VA. In other words, the differential's not because you don't use life captives. You do use life captives.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We are limited in New York as to how much we can do in life captives. So if we were a non-New York-domiciled company, we estimate that the statutory reserves could be $700 million lower by the use of captives for Universal Life and Term Insurance that takes into account XXX and AXXX reserves.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC: All right. Thanks.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Edward A. Spehar - Head-Investor Relations, MetLife, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for your participation. Have a good day.

Operator: Welcome to the MetLife Fourth quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I’d like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements related to trends in the Company's operations and financial results and the businesses and the products of the Company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Edward A. Spehar: Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. During the Q&A session, in fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the fourth quarter of 2013. And operating earnings per share were $1.38, a 1% increase over the prior year period. Full-year 2014 operating earnings were $6.6 billion, a 5% increase over 2013. In operating earnings per share we are up 2% from the prior year period. Operating return on equity was 12% for the full-year 2014 and tangible operating ROE was 15.2%. We believe tangible ROE is a better measure of the business returns for MetLife, because it excludes purchase accounting adjustments, primarily goodwill. Our strong 2014 operating earnings came on top of above plan results for 2013. And we once again achieved an operating ROE at the low end of our 2016 target of 12% to 14%. I am even more pleased with MetLife's multi year performance which is a better measure of success in our long-term business. MetLife's operating earnings increase at a compound annual rate of 12.1% from 2011 to 2014. Over the same period, operating EPS grew at a compound annual rate of 9.6%. Operating return on equity averaged 11.8% from 2012 through 2014, only slightly below the low end of 2016 target range. Close to double-digit operating EPS growth, and 12% operating ROE, during the past three years our noteworthy accomplishments given that the 10-year treasury yield has averaged 2.2% since the summer of 2011 and our capital management actions have been conservative due to regulatory uncertainty. With a 10-year treasury yield now at 2%, the low interest rate environment remains a challenge for life insurance -- for the life insurance business. Over the long-term, we believe the 10-year treasury yield should be 4% to 4.5%, based on the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target and expectations for long-term economic growth. However, if interest rates remain low indefinitely, there would likely be a downward reset in return expectations across asset classes. Because equity returns are measured against a risk-free rate, the spread between MetLife's operating ROE and the 10-year treasury yield is a key metric. From 2012 to 2014, the spread between MetLife’s ROE and the 10-year treasury yield has averaged 9.6%. This compares favorably to an average spread of 6.9% from 2000 the year MetLife’s initial public offering to 2011. I’d now like to comment on capital management. We repurchased $557 million of stock in the fourth quarter, completing the $1 billion share repurchase program we announced in June. For the year-to-date, we’ve taken advantage of share price weakness and repurchased $693 million of the $1 billion program we announced in December. Given where the stock is trading today, it is likely that we will complete this $1 billion program soon. While we continue to believe that MetLife is well capitalized, uncertainties surrounding potential capital rules makes us cautious about share repurchases in excess of $1 billion in 2015. Turning to strategy. In 2014, we achieved two key elements of the strategy that we announced in May of 2012. We have derisked the retail business, which was a large part of our refocus the U.S business cornerstone of our strategy and we achieved net expense savings of $600 million pre-tax. Our retail business has undergone a transformation during the past few years as we’ve worked to reduce risk, create a more efficient operation, and improve the productivity of our distribution force. Derisking meant pulling back from the variable annuity market and exiting the lifetime secondary guarantee universal life market. Both of these initiatives had a material negative impact on sales. We believe that 2014 will prove to be an inflection point for annuity sales and anticipate profitable growth in 2015 and beyond. In variable annuities I am pleased to announce that we will launch a new guaranteed lifetime minimum withdrawal benefit product, Flex Choice on February 17. The income benefit for this product meets the current expectations of the marketplace. As we communicated on our December outlook call, we anticipate more than a 50% increase in total annuity sales in 2015. However, a projected rebound in annuity sales does not mean we are changing our overall strategy, which is to emphasize growth and less capital intensive protection oriented product lines. First, the projected sales increase is from a low base. Variable annuity sales were $6.3 billion in 2014, down dramatically from $28.4 billion in 2011. Second, we estimate that retail annuities will count for a smaller percentage of enterprise capital over time. Another key strategy milestone in 2014 was achieving our net expense savings targets of $600 million pre-tax. Our gross expense savings were $910 million last year close to the $1 billion strategy target. We are highly confident that we will realize the $1 billion gross savings target in 2015. The difference between gross and net savings in 2014 was a combination of one-time costs and reinvestment in the business. One-time costs will fade, but there will be a substantial increase in the reinvestment spend, which is largely technology related. Expenditures that represent an investment in the future including much of the work we are doing to update our technology may reduce current period earnings, but are necessary to drive profitable growth over time. Turning to regulatory issues, as you know MetLife has filed a legal challenge to its designation as a systemically important financial institution by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. As I said when we filed the challenge last month, MetLife had hope to avoid litigation in light of the substantial and compelling evidence we presented to FSOC demonstrating the company is not systemically important. The Dodd Frank Act is clear that size alone does not make a company systemic and we believe FSOC erred in designating MetLife. We believe we’ve a strong legal case to present to the court and look for to its eventual decision. As a former regulator, I want to emphasize that MetLife as always supported robust regulation for the life insurance industry. It has operated under a stringent state regulatory system for decades. However, adding a new federal standard for just the largest life insurers, while retaining a different standard for everyone else will harm competition. This will drive up the cost of financial protection for consumers without making the financial system safer. We believe the government should preserve a level playing field in the life insurance industry. If additional regulation is necessary, the government has a superior tool at its disposal, an approach that focuses on potentially systemic activities regardless of the size of the firm. FSOC has already embraced this activities based approach for the asset management industry. Litigation takes time to resolve. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve is now one of MetLife’s regulators. We are cooperating fully with representatives from the New York Fed, as they carryout their supervisory duties. At the same time, we continue to discuss with regulators and lawmakers in Washington the need for capital rules that reflect the business of insurance. With the enactment of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act in December, the Federal Reserve now has the flexibility it needs to properly tailor capital rules for life insurers. In closing, let me reiterate MetLife's commitment to creating long-term value for shareholders. We are focused on maintaining the appropriate risk profile, selling business at attractive rates of return relative to our cost of capital and most important improving free cash flow so MetLife can return additional capital to shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Hele, to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I’ll then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the prior year period. And operating earnings per share were $1.38, up 1%. This quarter included 4 notable items, which were disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS. First, consistent with the guidance from our December outlook call, we’ve strengthened our asbestos legal reserves in the quarter to reflect higher frequency and severity of claims. This resulted in an after-tax charge of $170 million or $0.10 per share. Second, we had favorable one-time tax adjustments in Latin America and EMEA, which increased operating earnings by $27 million or $0.02 per share. Third, we had lower than budgeted catastrophe experience and favorable prior year development, which increased operating earnings by $16 million or $0.01 per share. Finally, we had three actuarial related items that increased operating earnings by a net $5 million or less than a penny per share. The first actuarial related item a $66 million reduction in operating earnings was related to interest on unclaimed funds from life policies where we cannot locate the beneficiaries. These unclaimed funds are held by state government and a multi-state audit determined that MetLife owed interest on these policies. The impact was a $57 million in retail life and other and $9 million in group voluntary and worksite benefit. The second, a $48 million benefit to operating earnings was a reserve adjustment to correct the treatment of the disability premium waiver wider in a number of term life contracts in retail life and other. You may recall, we had a positive adjustment for this item in the second quarter of 2014 as well. The third, a $23 million benefit to operating earnings in Asia was an unlocking of deferred acquisition costs or DAC. This unlocking resulted from a lower expense assumption for certain life products in Japan. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 5% year-over-year and 9% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers on a constant currency basis were underwriting improvement, business growth, and lower taxes, which were partially offset by less favorable equity market performance. Turning to our bottom-line results. Fourth-quarter net income was $1.5 billion or $1.30 per share. Net income was $93 million, below operating earnings in the quarter. Four items that explain most of this difference are: number one, charges of $140 million after-tax associated with asymmetrical accounting treatment for insurance contracts and other market value adjustments. Number two, derivative net losses of $40 million after-tax, which reflects changes in foreign currencies partially offset by gains from lower interest rates in the quarter. Number three, a loss of $25 million after-tax related to certain variable annuity guarantees where the hedge assets are more sensitive to market fluctuations than the GAAP treatment for guaranteed liabilities. And these were partially offset by number four, investment portfolio net gains of $129 million after-tax as credit related losses continue to be modest in the portfolio. Book value per share excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $49.53 as of December 30, up 5% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $40.36 at year-end, up 9% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, operating ROE was 11.3% and tangible operating ROE was 14.1%.As Steve noted, we believe tangible operating ROE provides a better measure of the underlying business returns for MetLife. Turning to fourth quarter margins. Underwriting results improved sequentially and year-over-year by approximately $0.06 after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Year-over-year highlights include improvement in mortality and morbidity experience in the U.S., as well as strong results in property and casualty. Retail life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 53.9% in the fourth quarter, and 53.0% after adjusting for the net impact of the notable items discussed earlier. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter of 54.2% and within our targeted range of 50% to 55%. This marked the second consecutive quarter of normal claim activity for retail life after four volatile quarters. The mortality ratio in group life was 88.4% and 87.4% after adjusting for the interest and unclaimed funds. The adjusted ratio was favorable to 87.9% in the prior year quarter as well -- and well within the targeted range of 85% to 90%. The non-medical health interest adjusted loss ratio was 77.4%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 80.9% and the low end of the targeted range of 77% to 82%. Disability underwriting improved, while dental margins were favorable to the prior year as utilization returned to a normal level. In our P&C business, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 85.8% in Retail and 92.3% in Group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 81.5% in Retail and 90.8% in Group. Overall, P&C underwriting results were favorable versus the prior year due to the lower non-cat losses and expenses as well as favorable prior year reserve development. Moving to fourth quarter investment margins, the average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 215 basis points, down 26 basis points year-over-year and 21 sequentially. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 186 basis points, down 13 basis points versus the prior year and five sequentially. The sequential decline in spreads can be attributed to three primary factors. First, pre-tax variable investment income was $325 million at the top end of our 2014 quarterly guidance range. After taxes in the impact to DAC, VII was $211 million, down $62 million sequentially due to weaker private equity and hedge fund returns. Second, core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average new money yields are running roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average roll off yield on the portfolio. And third, there was a transfer of cash into retail annuity upon the completion of the four-way merger in November, which accounts for the majority of the 20 basis point decline in deferred annuity spreads in the quarter. We would expect to reinvest this cash in [indiscernible] securities over time. With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 25.0% in the fourth quarter as compared to 25.3% in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for asbestos and other legal reserves in both quarters, the operating expense ratio was 23.7% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 23.6% in the prior year period. Gross expense saves were $259 million in the fourth quarter, and net saves were $163 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $33 million and one-time costs of $63 million. I’ll now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $683 million, up 4% versus the prior year quarter and up 7% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in Retail was driven by Life & Other, which reported operating earnings of $321 million, up 13% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were lower expenses and favorable underwriting. Life & Other PFOs were $2.2 billion, up 2% year-over-year primarily due to growth in the open block and P&C, partially offset by the run-off of the closed block. Annuities reported operating earnings of $362 million, down 3% versus the prior year quarter and essentially flat after adjusting for excess variable investment in the prior year. Annuities PFOs were $1.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year primarily due to the higher income annuity sales. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $235 million, up 2% versus the prior year quarter and 9% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting was the key driver with improved results in disability, dental, group life and P&C. GVWB PFOs were $4.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year and sales increased 17% due to strong growth across all products. Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $374 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter and 10% after adjusting for notable items. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and business growth. CBF PFOs were $1.5 billion, down 5% year-over-year due to lower income annuities and pension closeouts. On closeouts, we remain active, but disciplined and continue to see a good pipeline of small to mid-sized cases. Latin America reported operating earnings of $187 million, up 8% from the prior year quarter and 26% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the notable tax item in this quarter, operating earnings were up 17% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth across the region partially offset by higher expenses. Overall, Latin American taxes were unusually low in the quarter even after adjusting for the notable tax item. Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, down 5% from the prior year quarter and up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $335 million, up 3% from the prior year quarter and 9% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both quarters, operating earnings were up 7% on a constant currency basis. Improvement in investment margins and business growth in the region were the primary drivers. Asia PFOs were $2.3 billion, down 3% from the prior year quarter, but up 6% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to growth in Japan, Korea, and Australia. Asia sales were down 30% from the fourth quarter of 2013. The decline was expected. As the prior year quarter had a large group employee benefit sale in Australia and elevated yen life sales in Japan in advance of pricing changes. Adjusting for these items, Asia sales were up 1%. In Japan, total A&H sales were up 21% year-over-year and 52% sequentially. We have seen good traction from our two new medical products launched in September which we announced touring the 2014 Asia Investor Day. In EMEA, operating earnings were $85 million, down 4%, but at 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable tax items in both periods, operating earnings were up 7% on a constant currency basis due to business growth in the Middle East and a $7 million from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting. EMEA PFOs were up $671 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. Total sales increased 22%, with 40% growth in emerging markets, including strong employee benefits sales in the Middle East and A&H across the region. Finally, the operating loss in Corporate & Other was $316 million, as compared to an operating loss of $278 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for the increase in asbestos legal reserves this quarter, the operating loss was $199 million, which was within the $175 million to $225 million operating loss range that we guided to during our third quarter earnings call. I’ll now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.1 billion at December 31. In addition, our 2014 free cash flow ratio was 44% better than our updated December estimate of approximately 40%. Next I’d like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not yet completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2014, we estimate our combined RBC ratio will be in a range of 400% to 420%. Our Japan solvency margin ratio which we file quarterly was 1,003% as of the third quarter and we estimate that our fourth quarter ratio will be comparable. For our U.S insurance companies preliminary fourth quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.4 billion and statutory net income was approximately $1.7 billion. For the full-year of 2014, statutory operating earnings were approximately $5.2 billion and U.S statutory net income was approximately $3.8 billion. U.S statutory operating earnings on a comparable basis were down $1.2 billion versus the prior year primarily due to less favorable equity markets and reserve strengthening. We said in our December outlook call, that we thought statutory insurance reserve increases at our New York subsidiary would be $400 million to $600 million more than we had initially contemplated. Although we’re still finalizing year-end statutory statements, we anticipate the increase in reserves will be in line with its revised expectation. Even though the assumptions for cash flow testing reflected the lower interest rate environment since the December outlook call. The year-end financials will also show capital contributed to our life insurance captives driven by low interest rates. This increase in capital will be funded by $670 million of cash from the holding company with a $225 million contribution last year and a planned $445 million contribution in 2015. Despite this cash contributions from the holding company, free cash flow was better than our forecast in 2014 and we still believe a 45% to 55% ratio is a reasonable expectation for 2015. We estimate that our total U.S statutory adjusted capital was approximately $28 billion as of December 31, up 13% on a comparable basis to the prior year. In conclusion, MetLife had a good fourth-quarter to close out a strong year. Investment margins remain healthy despite pressure from low rates. Expenses are well controlled and underwriting improved for the second consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator, for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Ryan Krueger, KBW.
Ryan Krueger: Hey, thanks. Good morning. MetLife is unique among the public U.S life insurers, in that your largest subsidiary is domiciled in New York and subject to some more conservative reserving standards. We’ve seen a lot of life companies in the last couple of years take statutory charges in New York that they do not have to take in their other subsidiaries. So I guess, given that it seems like your 400% to 420% RBC ratio might not be directly comparable to the other company, so I was hoping can you give us any sense of how much more is statutory reserve that you hold at this point, because you’re domiciled in New York? Is there anything you can help us quantify there?
John C. R. Hele: Hi, Ryan. This is John. Well, as we’ve mentioned I think on prior calls, New York we believe is more conservative than other states. And we have had added reserves over the years. We haven’t exactly quantified that for the market, but suffice to say that our 400% to 420% we believe is quite strong.
Ryan Krueger: Okay. All right. I guess, second one on the variable annuity hedging strategy so -- now that you can got rid of the captive and you have to use traditional statutory VACARVM rather than the modified GAAP I think that you used in the captive. Have you changed your hedging strategy at all because of that?
John C. R. Hele: Hi, Ryan. This is John again. We’ve changed it slightly sort of to optimize for the VACARVM and how it moves. But much of it remains the same with some regular delta hedging as well as some tail type hedging going on, on an ongoing basis. The overall cost of program has not materially changed. We fine tuned it as we have done continuously since the start of the program.
Ryan Krueger: Okay. And is it accurate to say to think about it as the traditional statutory rules are less sensitive to interest rate movements than kind of a fair value GAAP approach?
John C. R. Hele: Yes, that is true.
Ryan Krueger: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Tom Gallagher with Crédit Suisse.
Thomas Gallagher: Hey, good morning. John, you discuss the capital ratios in the subs, can you comment on the holding company cash liquidity position capital that sits there right now?
John C. R. Hele: Hi, Tom. As I said, we’ve got approximately $6.1 billion of cash at our holding companies and this is the amount that’s free and clear. We have not given what is capital or required capital or excess capital; because we really don't know what the binding capital rules will be on us. And so our strategy has been to be conservative when it comes to overall capital management and to have a good balance in cash at the holding companies.
Thomas Gallagher: And when you say that’s $6.1 billion, that's free and clear. Just remind us what your -- the buffer that you typically hold given interest coverage and debt considerations?
John C. R. Hele: Well, prior to MetLife being, considered to being a SIFI, and now been a SIFI I believe sometime ago MetLife did give some numbers. But since we’ve been under a review and now that we’ve been picked, we’ve not given a target number because we really don’t know what the binding constraints will be, we don’t understand the capital rules. We of course do our own internal stress testing, and we have some number in mind. But to give you guidance on it would be misleading, because we just don’t know where it’s going to be. So, with regard to that we have just been conservative in how much we hold both thinking through a strong capitalized position within all of our insurance entities as well as having a strong cash position at the holding companies.
Thomas Gallagher: Okay. And just one follow-up for, Steve, though I guess the way you described the fact that you’re going to complete the $1 billion buyback program soon, but then you’re cautious of doing more in lieu of uncertain regulation. It’s a bit of a change in tones, and maybe it’s just that. But is there something new that’s occurred, and obviously the law suite is out there. But is there anything else going on behind the scenes that we should be thinking about if why there’s more caution now, because I think the last couple of times you’ve described capital management its been somewhat more constructive.
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: Tom, I think I’ve been pretty cautious right along. We didn’t engage in share repurchases for some time. Then given how long it took for the capital rules to come forward which they haven’t come forward yet. We decided to do a relatively conservative share repurchase program in 2014 of $1 billion, and we announced another $1 billion for 2015. The completion of that program will probably occur faster than we had anticipated when you put that program in place, because our share price had dropped in the marketplace or the drop in a 10 year treasury, and that accelerated our purchases because we kind of -- our purchases are based upon our view of value in the marketplace of our stock. So, I think it’s really consistent what we’ve been saying to you. I think its pretty consistent right along.
Thomas Gallagher: Okay. And lastly, is there any formality right now -- since the fed is you regulator now but you have this other issue going on. Is there any formality that is required to execute on our capital return programs or you just share information with them at this point?
John C. R. Hele: What we share -- this is John with our fed regulator now all capital management actions we are planning to do, and we’re in active discussions with them at all times. So, if we were to at some point consider doing capital management actions we will be informing them.
Thomas Gallagher: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with UBS. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. A quick follow-up to Ryan’s question on the RBC; so first of all -- so what's now in that RBC? Is it basically everything that you have in the U.S. x the XXX and AXXX captives? That’s my first question.
Steven A. Kandarian: Yes, it would be everything in the U.S. with the exception of the XXX or AXXX life captives and -- well everything material there may be some immaterial little about there, but it’s everything that is material U.S. business.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. And then, the 400% to 420% just based on your comments about the conservatism in New York, should we just -- should we assume that that’s a level that you’re comfortable running with. I know a lot of companies talk about a 400% minimum but then tend to hold more than that. But should we expect you to run at 400% to 420%?
Steven A. Kandarian: We do try to target about 400%, so that’s where we are. But we do also think about the strength of the overall balance sheets that we have in particular having the New York Company.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. And then I guess for Steve, I just wanted to get a sense of where you’re going with your commentary in your prepared remarks about ROE versus 10 year treasury. You kind of gave us two numbers the 2012, the ’14 and then the 2000 and 2011, and then there is obviously a delta between those. So, I’m not sure if you’re trying to suggest that we should be thinking about the 2000 to 2011 range relative to the 10 year or the ’12 to ’14 range. Just want to get a sense of where you’re going with that?
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: Suneet, my comments really were not MetLife specific. They were really more in terms of what investors should be thinking about in terms of return expectations by any asset class right now. I think people have now locked into certain numbers of ROE expectations for equities that may have made sense in a different environment than where we’re in today. If you have low interest rates for a long period of time, those expectations should come down. That was really my comment.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. But not reflective of your ROE, I guess that was my mistake.
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: No, it would be reflective, I think of every ones ROE. The all asset classes, that’s my point.
Suneet Kamath: Okay. I mean, I guess, so if we’re in 4% to 4.5% 10 year treasury world then using your guidance, I guess we should expect 14% to 14.5% kind of returns?
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: We said 12% to 14% in a normal 10 year treasury environment, and 4%, 4.5% treasury yield when there is 2% inflation which is the feds target. And I would say roughly 2.5% underlying real GDP growth would result in that kind of a level of a treasury. And then you expect something like 12% to 14% for MetLife, a large life insurance company with a diversified group of businesses, but still a large business in the United States which is a moderately growing market.
Suneet Kamath: All right. Thanks.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to come back to the interest rate disclosure you’ve given in your outlook presentation where you show the potential present value GAAP interest rate charge of $3 billion if rates stay at 2% forever. Just had two questions there, I guess first, how narrowly do you define interest rate impact and is it just the direct impact of low rates on reserves or do you also include DAC and second derivative impacts like policy holder behavior? And then secondly, how sensitive is that number to a drop in interest rates below 2%?
John C. R. Hele: Hi, Erik, it’s John. So that number is total GAAP impact. It would include DAC. It would include any GAAP reserve strength in that might be required. Policy holder behavior is I don’t know how people annuitize more or less or enact their rights more or less depending upon where the 10 year treasury is. We haven’t seen any indication of that so far in our experience. So that’s something that we would just have to see how things develop on that. And we haven’t given more sensitivities to this than the two, it’s highly complex to do calculation and get all this done. We think this is pretty good disclosure giving you a sensitivity.
Erik Bass: Okay. I appreciate that. And I guess, just the one follow-up. How do movements in interest rates affect your expected free cash flow generation in 2015 and I know you reiterated the 45% to 55% target range. I believe in the past there has been some fluctuation based on kind of derivative marks and other things that have had an impact. So, is this how should we think about that?
John C. R. Hele: Well clearly a big piece of our free cash flow comes in particular from our U.S. statutory entities, and the statutory accounting, the operating earnings is more sensitive to movements in interest rates due to derivative movements than say GAAP is. So, that does impact it. It impacts at the following year though, because our dividend capacity is based on your earnings in a year, and that’s how much you can take up the next year. So, it’s kind of a bit of a delayed item. So in any one year interest rate moves will have an impact on the following year. That’s why we give you a range around this, but over a two or three year period we believe these things average out. Once you have the derivative gain or loss, if rates stay the same then you don’t have that repeating. But as we’ve seen rates have gone up and gone down in the past few years. So, there’ll always be some fluctuation with regard to this and that’s why we give you a range.
Erik Bass: Got it. But the 45% to 55% is still a pretty comfortable range for 2015?
John C. R. Hele: Right. As I said we are even with the reserved strengthening that we’ve taken due to low rates. We are still at the 45% to 55% for 2015.
Erik Bass: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions on your group business. First, if you can just discuss your comfort with your GAAP and stat reserves for the long-term inner block. We have seen a number of companies take actions recently. And then, second on the disability business, it seems like your non-medical claims, margins were actually pretty good. So maybe if you could talk about claims, incidence and recovery trends in that market -- in the disability business?
John C. R. Hele: Hi, this is John. I’ll do reserves, and turn it over to Bill for the claims. So, we have a closed block of long-term care, and we in stat the reserves are significantly higher than the GAAP reserves due to conservatism typically from the New York accounting and how we have to abide for this. The stat reserves do not assume future rate increases other than what have been already approved in the states. The GAAP assume a best estimate where we do expect to get some rate increases, but it’s not really a very material amount compared to the enforced reserves from the rate increases. And we have reserve adequacy in both the stat and GAAP reserves as of year end 2014.
Jimmy Bhullar: And the interest rate and assumptions embedded in those; are you assuming a pick up in rates over the next few years?
John C. R. Hele: Our GAAP reserves do assume a mean reversion, and the stat reserves of course are subject to cash flow testing that have a range of interest rates.
William J. Wheeler: Jimmy, it’s Bill Wheeler, with regard to kind of what's going on in -- long-term disability, group disability, the number itself is quite good this quarter. It’s much better than we have had for really any quarter in the last over a year. And I guess, I would describe the pieces of it are, incidence is stable, claims revolution is much improved as you would hope given the changes we put in place regarding our claims operations because I think I talked about it couple of quarters ago. And so, that’s good news. Its somewhat offset by social security offsets are soft. And they have been soft for a while now, and I think that has a lot to do with what's going on in the social security administration more than it does with MetLife. So, those are kind of it, that I would say the big pieces that are moving around. But the net result is it’s -- it was a good number this quarter.
Jimmy Bhullar: And pricing in that market, as you’ve gone through the renewal season for the beginning of the year, like how were overall pricing trends?
William J. Wheeler: Very favorable. We asked for significant renewals obviously based on our experience we thought that was appropriate, and I would say our achievement of those renewal rate increases was very successful with very modest lapse rates.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we do have a question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning. I have a follow-up question for Steve on the interest rate environment and kind of thoughts on ROE. I think in the past you had said that in the low ROE -- in the low interest rate environment there’s a 12% to 14% long-term target really moves down to 11% to 13%. Is that still the way we should be thinking about it? Hello?
John C. R. Hele: Hi. This is, John, I’ll just answer that. Yes we had tried to give you some guidance that if rates stayed low for a long period of time that it would be slightly lower by 2016.
Yaron Kinar: All right. Can you quantify that?
John C. R. Hele: It was about a 100 basis points.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Nigel Dally: Great, thanks. On annuities, can you provide some more details on your new Flex Choice product with high guarantees; is it fair to say that it has a lower return than your previous product? And if that’s true, if can you discuss where those anticipated returns come out?
Steven A. Kandarian: Nigel, I’m sorry. Can you just do that one more time?
Nigel Dally: Sure. With your new Flex Choice product with a high guarantee, is it fair to say that it has a lower return, and if that’s true can you discuss where those anticipated return to come out?
Steven A. Kandarian: Well, Nigel its -- so we are raising the underlying roll up rate from 4% to 5%, obviously on the 4% was our old [ph] GMIB and this is a withdrawal benefit. It does not -- we have not compromised the return on our variable annuity products. This product as you would hope meets our return expectations because there are a bunch of other features in the product which allow us to lower the capital charge, and so we’re excited about it. With the GMIB as you know there are, the policy holder has more choices about, what he wants to do. And of course we have to make assumptions about policy holder behavior and hedge accordingly, and that’s really not the case with the GMWB. There is less optionality in the product and therefore the hedging is much more straightforward. And so, and that contributes I think to the improvement in the return to lower capital allocation to the product.
Nigel Dally: Great. Thanks.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Seth Weiss: Hi, good morning. A question on the asset adequacy testing, you mentioned in line with expectations. Can you give us any color by products, how that asset adequacy testing looks?
Steven A. Kandarian: Hi, Seth. Well I’m sure our actuaries would love to give you all sorts of details on this. But for the second time, New York requires us to do cash flow testing separately for long-term care because it is a closed block, and that’s driving some of the numbers that I mentioned at our December outlook calls having to raise reserves due to the asset adequacy -- the reserve testing. But we do this across all of our businesses. We use the New York seven scenarios not only in all non New York companies, but even our life insurance captives, and that again -- I mentioned some more capital that we are putting up there for lower interest rates. We did use rates that were actually lower than where we saw year end 10 year treasuries. But it’s a little more complex than that because it’s not just a 10 year treasury it’s the shape of the yield curve and the reinvestment curve. And actually compared to few years ago we actually have a flatter curve, and the 30 year treasury is actually lower than we saw even a couple of years ago when we saw low interest rates prior. So that has impacted the asset testing because of these long dated contracts, it’s a very long reinvestment fund, so it does have an impact. So, as we mentioned, the testing that we’ve now just completed for yearend does reflect some more recent conditions, and it’s within the range that we had talked about in December.
Seth Weiss: Okay, great. And to clarify the 400 to 600 that’s on top, the 200 that you expected right? So 600 to 800 is the range we should think about?
Steven A. Kandarian: Yes, exactly.
Seth Weiss: Right. Thank you.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Eric Berg with RBC. Please go ahead.
Eric Berg: Thanks. So, I just wanted to return to an earlier question and clarify the response of share repurchase. Is the point Steve that you have announced two share repurchases each for $1 billion, and that its your intention at this point to complete both but that with respect to the second it would be unrealistic to expect sort of an increase on top of that. Second, share repurchase, is that what I heard?
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: Hi, Eric. What we said is that we are going to remain cautious given the capital rules have not been drafted yet or issued by the fed. So, we have not completed the second $1 billion repurchase program. So we haven’t made a final determination. We’ll see when that program concludes, what we know more about the capital rules at that point in time. But I was signaling that we’re going to remain quite cautious here until the capital rules come out. And my best guess is those rules will not be out before the second program concludes.
Eric Berg: Thank you. End of Q&A
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions in queue. Please continue.
Steven A. Kandarian: Okay. Thank you much for your participation. Have a good day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the businesses and products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Edward A. Spehar: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our press release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, Ed. And good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong third quarter results. Operating earnings were $1.8 billion, up 22% from the third quarter of 2013. And operating return on equity was 13.2%, an increase from 11.7% in the prior-year period. Notable items in the quarter were variable investment income above the top end of the normal quarterly range, favorable catastrophe experience and prior year loss reserve development in property and casualty, a positive impact from our annual review of actuarial assumptions and a modest net negative impact from tax adjustments. These notable items increased operating earnings by $107 million. Excluding notable items, operating earnings increased 14% from the third quarter of 2013. Favorable investment margins have been a consistent earnings theme in recent years despite low interest rates. In the quarter, the average investment spread for U.S. product lines was 236 basis points or within the approximately 220 to 240 basis point range of the past few years. Strong variable investment income more than offset the negative impact on investment margins from low interest rates. While the 2014 interest rate environment has been close to the low-rate scenario we provided in our 2013 10-K, the earnings impact has been more benign than we predicted, largely due to management actions. Investment margins in both Retail life and Latin America returned to normal levels in the third quarter. Underwriting margins in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits were the low end of the normal range but better than the prior year quarter. Within group, disability results improved year-over-year and sequentially. We anticipate further improvement in disability results from the operational changes and targeted price increases that we shared with you on the Second Quarter Earnings Call. Turning to expenses. We continue to deliver on the cost savings outlined as part of MetLife's strategy. The operating expense ratio of 23.0% in the quarter versus 24.3% in third quarter of last year. Operating expenses also remained well controlled on an absolute basis, up 2% from the prior year period compared to a 5% increase in adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues. Another key element of our strategy, growing in emerging markets, also showed progress in the quarter. Compared to the prior year period, sales in emerging markets were up 10% in Latin America, 31% in EMEA and 20% in Asia. On a per share basis, operating earnings in the quarter were $1.60, a 19% increase from the prior year period. Growth on a per share basis was dampened by the conversion of $1 billion of equity units into common shares in September 2013. The dilutive impact of these conversions was partially offset by our repurchase of $438 million of stock in the third quarter at an average price of $54.19 per share. Since we resumed our share repurchase program in late June of this year, we have repurchased a total of $756 million of stock at an average price of $52.53 per share. Our strong third quarter stands in contrast to our second quarter. We are pleased to see underwriting results improve after the second quarter's adverse experience. In addition, the Corporate & Other loss was modest, largely as a result of tax benefits and well below the elevated level of the second quarter. At the same time, it's important to remember that this is a long-term business and quarterly results will fluctuate. And as you have heard me say before, paying too much attention to quarterly performance could lead us to take actions contrary to the future health of the business. Running a business for the long term takes patience and a recognition that what managers choose not to do is often just as important as what they choose to do. Consider MetLife's strategy in the pension risk transfer market. As you know, MetLife did not win either of the 2 large pension closeout deals announced recently. We find the market opportunity in closeouts attractive, and MetLife has been winning profitable business from small and mid-sized pension plans. We will continue to bid on transactions of all sizes but will remain disciplined. We believe our bids on recent large closeouts would have created value for MetLife's shareholders, but the spread over our cost of capital was modest. The competitive landscape for large closeouts leaves little margin for error. Pension closeouts are long-dated liabilities that cannot be repriced, so a negative surprise relative to assumptions could impact returns for decades. We know that large closeouts can have a material positive impact on GAAP earnings. However, our philosophy is that near-term GAAP earnings accretion is not necessarily indicative of long-term value creation for shareholders. I would now like to provide a brief update on regulatory developments. As you know, the Financial Stability Oversight Council voted on September 4 to make a proposed determination that MetLife is a systemically important financial institution or SIFI. On October 3, MetLife requested an evidentiary hearing, which is scheduled for November 3, to contest the proposed determination. After the hearing, FSOC has 60 days to make a final determination as to whether MetLife is a SIFI. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, if MetLife is designated, the company has 30 days to decide whether to seek a judicial review of the designation in federal district court. With regard to the capital rules for nonbank SIFIs, the Federal Reserve announced on September 30 that it will conduct a quantitative impact study or QIS to "better understand how to design a capital framework for insurance holding companies and supervisors that has compliance with the Collins Amendment." Although MetLife is not under its supervision, the Federal Reserve accepted our request to participate in the QIS. It is important to note that the QIS assumes that the new rules will be compliant with the Collins Amendment, which the Federal Reserve interprets as requiring it to impose bank capital standards on all nonbanks under its supervision. We believe this underscores the critical importance of enacting the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act as quickly as possible. We are encouraged that the House and Senate have already passed identical language, providing the Federal Reserve with flexibility to tailor the capital rules for insurance companies. And we urge Congress to finish the job during the lame duck legislative session later this fall. To sum up, I am pleased that, in the face of economic and regulatory headwinds, MetLife continues to perform well in those areas under its control, including expense management, pricing discipline and investment performance. Performing well on the fundamentals is the clearest path to creating shareholder value over time. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele.
John C. R. Hele: Thank you, Steve. And good morning. Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. Operating earnings in the third quarter were $1.8 billion, up 22% from the prior year period. And operating earnings per share were $1.60, up 19%. This quarter includes 4 notable items, which are highlighted in our press release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS. First, variable investment income was $273 million after taxes and DAC, which is $62 million or $0.05 per share above the top end of our quarterly guidance range. Second, we had lower-than-budgeted catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development, which increased operating earnings by $38 million or $0.03 per share. Third, we had 2 tax items that mostly offset. The onetime impact from Chilean tax reform reduced operating earnings by $41 million or $0.04 per share, and this was largely offset by a favorable tax adjustment of $32 million or $0.03 per share related to the filing of our 2013 U.S. federal tax return. Finally, as a result of our annual actuarial assumption review, there was a $16 million or $0.01 per share positive impact to operating earnings. There were a number of small items that drove this result, and most of the benefit was in Retail. The total positive impact to GAAP net income from the actuarial assumption review was $105 million. In total, notable items included an operating earnings of $107 million or $0.09 per share. Turning to our bottom line results. Third quarter net income was $2.1 billion or $1.81 per share. Net income exceeded operating earnings by $239 million. The 3 most significant items that explain the majority of this difference are: one, derivative net gains of $187 million after tax and other adjustments, primarily from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar; two, an impact of $89 million after-tax from the portion of the actuarial assumption review that was not included in operating earnings; and three, net investment gains of $71 million after tax. Non-economic and asymmetrical accounting adjustments were $146 million of the $239 million difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter. Before I discuss margins and business segments, I want to highlight new metrics for book value and ROE included in the QFS. We are now disclosing book value excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments or FCTA, and tangible book value. Operating ROE will now be calculated using these 2 measures of book value. We believe operating ROE, based on book value excluding AOCI other than FCTA, is a better measure of performance than an operating ROE calculation based on book value excluding AOCI, as the former includes the impact of foreign currency in both the numerator and denominator. We are making this change because FCTA has become more significant and now distorts the ROE calculation. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $49.69 as of September 30, up 7% year-over-year but below book value per share, excluding AOCI, of $51.62. Operating ROE in the third quarter was 13.2% on book value excluding AOCI other than FCTA or 40 basis points higher than the 12.8% using book value excluding AOCI. Tangible book value and tangible operating ROE are also new disclosures this quarter. Tangible book value is calculated by excluding goodwill and other non-insurance intangible assets from book value excluding AOCI other than FCTA. These intangible assets were $10.9 billion as of September 30, and the vast majority was goodwill. Tangible book value per share was $39.95 as of September 30, up 7% year-over-year, and tangible operating ROE was 16.7% in the third quarter. We believe tangible operating ROE provides a better measure of the underlying business returns for MetLife. Turning to third quarter margins. Underwriting was favorable to the prior year quarter. Highlights included a recovery in Retail and Latin America from a weak second quarter, modest improvement in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits on a sequential and year-over-year basis and strong results in property and casualty. Retail life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 51.0% in the third quarter, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review. This ratio was in line with the prior year quarter and significantly better than the adjusted second quarter of 55.2%. Large claims returned to a normal level in the third quarter from an elevated level in the second quarter. In Latin America, underwriting results were similar to the prior year quarter but better than the second quarter. The sequential improvement was driven by Mexico worksite marketing claims returning to a normal level and the absence of negative onetime items. The mortality ratio in group life was 89.9% versus 90.3% in the prior year period. Results this quarter were at the top end of our 85% to 90% targeted range but only slightly above the 89.1% third quarter average during the prior 3 years, when adjusting for the -- a onetime item in the third quarter of 2011. The non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 79.0%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 80.6% and down sequentially from 82.6%. Disability underwriting results were favorable to the prior year quarter and improved sequentially, largely due to lower claim severity. Dental margins were unfavorable to the prior year, driven by higher utilization. On a year-to-date basis, dental utilization is unchanged compared to the first 9 months of 2013. In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 83.6% in Retail and 91.0% in group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 79.3% in Retail and 86.2% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting results were favorable versus the prior year due to the -- due to lower catastrophe and non-cat losses as well as favorable prior year reserve development. Moving to third quarter investment margins. As Steve noted, the average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 236 basis points, up 15 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 191 basis points, down 16 basis points versus the prior year and 4 basis points sequentially. While we have experienced modest compression in our recurring investment margins, this has been more than offset by strong variable investment income. Overall, we are pleased with our investment margins, particularly in this persistent low rate environment. With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.0% in the third quarter, as compared to 24.3% in the year-ago quarter. As Steve mentioned, expenses were up only 2% year-over-year. Adjusting for Provida as well as onetime regulatory and project costs, expenses were below the prior year level. Gross expense saves were $239 million in the third quarter, and net saves were $162 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $29 million and onetime costs of $48 million. While we caution against extrapolating any 1 quarter's results, the annualized effect of the net saves has reached our targeted bottom line benefit of $600 million, which was announced at the May 2012 Investor Day. In addition to our expectation for a modest increase in gross expense saves, we anticipate that, over time, the reinvestment spend will increase while onetime costs decrease. I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $699 million, up 6% versus the prior year quarter and up 2% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in Retail was driven by Life & Other, while -- which reported operating earnings of $350 million, up 48% versus the prior year quarter and up 15% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were favorable expense margins and underwriting. Annuities reported operating earnings of $349 million, down 17% versus the prior quarter -- year quarter and down 6% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were negative net flows and lower core spreads, partially offset by favorable markets and lower expenses. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $237 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter and essentially flat after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting results improved in group life and disability, partially offset by less-favorable dental results. GVWB PFOs was $4.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year. GVWB sales increased 10% from the prior year quarter due to growth in group life and disability businesses. Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $408 million, up 37% versus the prior year quarter and up 26% after adjusting for notable items. Growth was driven by improved interest margins and favorable underwriting results. CBF PFOs were $582 million, up 2% year-over-year due to growth in structured settlements and income annuities, partially offset by lower pension closeouts. We remain active but disciplined in the pension closeout market and continue to see a good pipeline of small to mid-sized cases. Latin America reported operating earnings of $152 million, up 14% from the prior year quarter and 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by the Provida acquisition and business growth across the region. Chilean tax reform, which resulted in a onetime charge of $41 million, was a partial offset. Latin America PFOs were $1.1 billion, up 24% from the prior year quarter and 31% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $306 million, up 19% from the prior year quarter on both a reported and constant currency basis and down 3% after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. Business growth and solid investment margins were muted because of positive onetime tax impacts in the prior year. Asia PFOs were $2.5 billion, up 3% from the prior year quarter and 5% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to growth in Australia. Asia sales were up 10% from the prior year period, driven by strong growth in Australia and China. Repricing of products in Japan explains an 18% decline in sales from the prior year quarter. We continue to focus on value over volume in Japan as new business sales are generating attractive returns relative to the prior year. In EMEA, operating earnings were $96 million, up 13% year-over-year and 20% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers in the quarter were business growth in the Middle East, a $10 million after-tax benefit from the annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, as well as an incremental $5 million benefit from the conversion of certain operations at calendar-year reporting. EMEA PFOs were up 3% from the prior year period and 4% on a constant currency basis. Total sales increased 12%, with 31% growth in emerging markets, including strong employee benefits sales in the Middle East. Finally, the operating loss in Corporate & Other was $73 million, as compared to $163 million in the prior year quarter. The improvement in Corporate & Other was mainly due to certain tax items. These items include the previously noted $32 million benefit related to the filing of the company's 2013 U.S. federal tax return, a $31 million year-to-date adjustment to reflect lower estimated tax rate in 2014 and a tax benefit from the timing of certain dividend payments from non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Corporate & Other line is difficult to predict on a quarterly basis, and we think that the third quarter loss was well below a normal level. We would expect Corporate & Other loss to be between $175 million and $225 million in the fourth quarter and within our guidance range of $550 million to $750 million for the full year. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6 billion at September 30, which is up from $5.5 billion at June 30. The increase from the second quarter was driven by approximately $1.5 billion of subsidiary dividends, less common stock dividends and share buybacks. For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary third quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1 billion, up 43% from the prior year quarter, and statutory net income was approximately $1.1 billion, up 140%. The increase in statutory operating earnings was primarily due to lower taxes and unfavorable mortality, partially offset by lower separate account returns. The increase in statutory net income was due to these factors and lower derivative losses. Next I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. As you know, we report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. Our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital is expected to be approximately $28 billion as of September 30, up 6% compared to December 31. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio is 1,018% as of the second quarter of 2014, which is the latest public data. In conclusion, MetLife had a strong third quarter. Investment margins remain healthy. Expenses are well controlled, and underwriting improved. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong, providing us with the flexibility to be opportunistic in managing capital as we seek to maximize shareholder value. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First, I had a question on just your spreads overall. They've been pretty strong throughout the year and even if you exclude variable investment income. So if I think about your guidance, I think you had talked about a 10-year Treasury yield of around 3.36% or so by the end of the year, so we're considerably below that. Just wondering how you think about that as you look into 2015 and look at your spreads and margins given the current interest rate environment.
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: Jimmy, it's Steve Goulart on. I'll start and in just thinking about rates. I mean you're right that rates are a lot lower than the consensus. And I think, even when we look at the outlook, I think the forecast within the year is 2 88 for the 10 year and 3 35 next year. We're probably still more conservative about that, but remember there are 2 legs to this too. So we've had strong VII. We continue to have good recurring income, but we are continuing to reinvest or roll off at rates, call it, 100 to 150 below the assets that are rolling off. So we're able to maintain the yield portion of this through strong VII and continued good ALM discipline, but remember the other piece of it is also pricing and crediting rates on products too. So a margin takes both pieces to work together, and I think the other pieces work together. And I don't know if Bill wants to add anything to that.
William J. Wheeler: Well, if you look at our businesses, I mean it's in the disclosure: Our crediting rates have been flat for a long time because we've reached product rate minimums in many of our products. And even though new sales generally have lower interest rate credit minimums, they're -- it's only changing the mix slightly. Therefore, I think you're going to see investment spread compression continue, barring some significant macroeconomic change in interest rates. So I think that's it's been a very gradual decline in terms of spread compression. And I think that will continue with maybe the same -- some offset from VII.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And on VII, can you talk about what asset classes did better than normal? Obviously, VII was a little bit higher than your -- the high end of your range. And which asset classes outperformed those that underperformed?
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: Sure. The trend continues, basically. We've had strong private equity performance for most of the year, and that happened again in the third quarter. Prepayments continue to be a little bit ahead of our projections too, both bond and mortgages. And hedge funds have sort of underperformed to plan. And I think, in looking at the fourth quarter, we generally expect that trend. I don't think you'll see the same strong VII results in the fourth quarter, but I would still expect this to be within our planned range of 2 25 to 2 75, maybe more toward the lower end, just looking at what's happened in PE and hedge funds in the last couple of months.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Crédit Suisse.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: First question, for John, just following up on your comment on corporate loss expectations going forward. So if I start with the dollar -- adjusted $1.51 number, stripping out the unusual items, I would then, I guess, adjust corporate other by another $0.07 or so at least. Any other adjustments that you would make when you think about run rate heading into 4Q?
John C. R. Hele: Yes, so I gave the range for the loss in the fourth quarter between $175 million and $225 million, and that's really getting out these tax -- mainly tax adjustments that we had in corporate in this quarter, with some of it was from last year which is notable that was taken out. And then the -- but there's still some catch-up in the tax rate that we made in this quarter to get at the effective tax rate for the year. So I think it's within the guidance that I've given.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, but no -- and I heard Steve Goulart's comment about his expectation for VII, so we can make that adjustment as well, but any other -- anything else that you don't believe as necessarily trendable, whether it's encaje returns within Lat Am or anything else, certain FX adjustments that you would make that you feel like are notable enough to not extrapolate this quarter into next or to make any adjustments?
John C. R. Hele: Well, Tom, I think we have a policy that we don't give guidance other than for some specific items like Corporate & Other and a few things and VII for the year. So we've given those pieces, but that's as far as we do. Thanks.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just one follow-up, I guess, for Steve. I saw the IAIS capital standard came out, I guess it was earlier this week, and was just curious -- or maybe it was late last week. Just curious if this is something that you all have been analyzing. And if so, what are your thoughts on it? And do you think there's any -- should we be thinking about that impacting what the Fed might do in terms of nonbank SIFI framework?
Steven A. Kandarian: Okay, Tom, thanks. I'm going to answer your question in 1 minute, but it was brought to my attention that I misread one of the words in my remarks. I had meant to say that underwriting margins in both Retail life and Latin America returned to normal levels in the third quarter, and I guess I said investment margins. I suppose that's a hazard of being a former Chief Investment Officer. But so Tom, in terms of the standards that just came out by the IAIS, they talked about basic capital requirements, which is where the starting point on which they will kind of develop higher loss absorbency requirements for global systemically important insurers. They will be named GSIIs. So that would include us. Now I will say it's still early days, but the key focus by us is on this HLL -- HLA standard, higher loss absorbency, and that has yet to be determined. They've talked about some principles, but it's still being worked on. So we are working very closely with regulators across the globe and with groups like the IAIS; through the IIF, the International Institute of Finance; and The Geneva Association; and others, and we're quite engaged in this. It's still early days, I'd say. And I think it's important to remember that these international bodies have no regulatory authority other than to make suggestions to the national or local regulators, who either adopt or do not adopt the standards they ultimately come up with. So it's a long way of saying we're still far from knowing what these standards will mean in terms of actual impact upon our company or the industry.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets.
Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I just have one question. As you think about your cost of equity capital and your discussion around pension risk transfer transactions, and you indicated that participating in some of these larger transactions would have created value for you but modest value for your shareholders, do you perceive -- as best as you can tell, do you perceive your cost of equity capital to be materially different from that of other large insurers?
Steven A. Kandarian: It's Steve. I don't really want to try to opine upon other people's cost of equity capital, but I think we have a pretty good understanding of our cost of equity capital, what impacts it. And we've taken steps from our strategy work to try and reduce that as well as increase our returns. And we look closely at all businesses, including the pension closeout business, to determine where we think we're creating shareholder value and where we're not. And we'll bid on that kind of business but we'll be very disciplined, as I mentioned in my remarks. And we can't really speak to what others' thought process is or what they think their cost of equity capital is, to simply make sure that whatever we do on our side is a value to our shareholders over the long run.
Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: One quick follow-up. Is it that the smaller end of the market, the smaller -- well, let's say, the mid-sized employer market for pension risk transfers is just less competitive and that has allowed you to achieve your targeted rates of returns, where you weren't able to do so in the larger market? What's different about the markets where you have achieved success in terms of winning business?
William J. Wheeler: Eric, it's Bill. So we ask that -- we've asked that question a lot internally ourselves about, geez, there's something going on with expenses or implementation costs for smaller deals that -- versus large deals. And the answer is it -- I think every transaction is a little different in terms of what we think the mortality experience is likely to be, the assets that are getting transferred over and or not. And so they're all a little different. My -- I would've assumed at one time that -- larger-case deals, because there are just less bidders, because there are less bidders avail -- able to take the larger transactions on their balance sheet, that those would have been somewhat less competitive. That has clearly turned out not to be true, at least in the last couple of years. And we have experienced a lot more success in the small end of the market than the large. And we were -- last year, for instance, in 2013, we were the market share leader in this category. There were not any large deals last year. And even after these 2 big deals were announced, we won shortly right after that 3 smaller deals. So it's hard to understand the competitive dynamics in terms of large versus big. I would just say there's -- I don't think, really, there's much difference.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America.
Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Two quick ones. First, just in terms of the ultimate goal for ROE, if we look at the new book value standard. It looks like it gives you about 30 to 40 basis points, at least this quarter, because of lower book value. When you think about your ultimate ROE objective, has that changed because of the rebasing of the book value?
John C. R. Hele: No. This is John. I mean the goal of our ROE was set out as a strategy, which was a basic return goal of return over equity, and you want to have that on the same basis. Currency has moved quite a bit since 2012. As I said, this just was not really a major impact in prior years. '13, it started to become more as continuing, so we thought it was important to make this adjustment. Most of our major competitors adjust for this already in how they quote and think about this. So it truly is the economic return that's happening to get apples and apples on the numerator and the denominator. So we think it's a better measure, but we are returning, with these measures we're publishing, to the goals that we set out of the 12% to the 14% ROE.
Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And if I could ask just one question on PRT. And Steve, I appreciate your commentary on the conservatism of your pricing. When you think about the sensitivity of your ultimate profitability of this business, is interest rates the primary and the overall variable that's really driving the sensitivity? Or is it mortality and other assumptions that also causes a lot of the sensitivity of your profitability analysis?
William J. Wheeler: Well, again, we look at -- this is Bill Wheeler again. We look at the -- anytime we -- a case of any size, we have to look at the underlying mortality experience and extrapolate from that in terms of -- because remember, the closeouts we're doing, they're almost all retired lives. They're not generally active lives. And retired lives, what's the age of the group? What -- there are lots of demographic issues which can change the mortality assumptions. You have to make a good assumption there. And then we have a target set of investments that we want to put up against these liabilities. We have a standard set, and that'll inform our investment spreads. Those are the 2 big drivers. It's really not administrative costs, though we have a very efficient administrative platform. Or it's not setup costs. It's -- that's the 2 big factors are mortality experience and then the investment spreads you're going to earn.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup.
Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: You used to discuss the sales trends you're seeing in group benefits and the level of activity in the market. I mean it's also -- are you starting to see any benefit from employment growth on plan enrollments?
William J. Wheeler: Yes, Erik, it's Bill again. The -- so we're having a good sales year. And I think John alluded to that, that sales activity is up year-over-year. We're -- we had a -- we've talked, I think, in previous quarters about exchanges. The exchange numbers that sales numbers came in, essentially where we think they're going to for the full year, but the adoption there is pretty slow, so I would say that's not a very big factor yet in the group marketplace. The -- we're also -- I would argue, I would contend we're having quite a good renewal season in terms of cases we already had that have come up for renewal pricing. We are generally achieving our targets there, and that's good. So that means the market is -- it's competitive but not overly competitive. And in terms of adding -- seeing increases due to payroll, I would say, right now, that's modest. And there is a little bit of growth there, but it's not very material.
Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then on just the underwriting results in group, can you give a little bit more detail on where you saw improvement this quarter and where you see additional opportunities?
William J. Wheeler: Sure. So there are 3 big drivers here. It's group life, disability and dental. Group life, a little better year-over-year, right at the -- just under the top end of our guidance range, so I would call it a so-so underwriting quarter. I think there's improvement left there, and I think you'll probably see that in the coming quarters the next year. Disability, pretty good improvement sequentially. And I think -- and I -- we are working through our -- I think, on the last quarterly call, we talked about some operational issues in one of our claims management sites. And we've seen some improvement in the metrics there, and I think that will continue. So I think there's opportunity for continued upside there. As John alluded to in the call, dental was soft this quarter. We're still seeing a catch-up in utilization. Remember, in the first quarter, we had a really poor weather. Nobody went to the dentist, and -- but they did eventually go see their dentists in the second quarter and also the third quarter. So utilization now is just where it was at the 9-month period last year, so I think we've had our catch-up. And so my guess is dental will -- should improve from here as well. So I see -- even though I think it was an okay improvement overall in group underwriting, I think there's more to come.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I had a couple of follow-up questions on interest rates. So first, if we think of the better performance than expected on the interest rate front, given that interest rates have come down and spreads have not weakened nearly to the degree that you expected back when you provided the 10-K assumptions, what else do you have? Are there any other things that you can do as you think of 2015 and a possibly lower rate environment there that could still mitigate the impacts from the declining rates?
John C. R. Hele: This is John. And our strategy, I think, will continue, that we have mitigated much of the decrease in the core spreads by variable investment income. And of course, we've been helped by good equity markets and other factors, but also the diversification of our asset structure helps mitigate this, as well as the derivatives that have been purchased some time ago. Unfortunately, as time wears on, that impact from those derivatives will slowly start to wear off and we will be faced with declining spreads if rates stay at these low levels. So it's there will be continued pressure on this, and we are doing our best to mitigate it.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, and that leads me to my second question, which really goes to -- back to the assumption review. So clearly, there was no real impact from a lower interest rate environment in the assumption review. And I know that the company had lowered it's expected total returns a couple of years ago. If rates remain kind of lower for longer, at what point do you have to revisit your current assumptions? Or are you comfortable with where they are today regardless of kind of the rate environment that we currently see?
John C. R. Hele: Right. So that's -- it's a very important question and something that we consider all the time. Rates are low. We even saw some quite low 10-year Treasury rates just a few weeks ago. And so the question always is does that make you change your long-term assumption. Our actuaries make assumptions that impact our business for the next 50-plus years, sometimes even longer, so you have to think about this over a very long time. And we look at recent trends, but we also look way back, over 100 years or 50 years or 40 years. And you think about your different economic cycles. So you have to take all those into account. We do target basically a 4.5% 10-year Treasury, which is a basis of the Fed inflation target of 2% and then a long-term growth return for the U.S. economy. We still think that is appropriate for the long, long term. We do great into that from where we are today. And we also have to remember that even though we have low rates, we just saw the announcement that the Federal Reserve is stopping bond buying, so an unprecedented buying within the market, so that's never been seen before by both the Federal Reserve and the ECB, which has a big impact on global markets. And I think the Fed said that they will be buying more, but they will keep their current balance the same, so they will buy. They will keep it up, so they won't even see that going down. And this has a large impact on what's happening to interest rates. We've also seen some global economic concerns, which there's always a flight to U.S. Treasuries whenever that happens. So I think you always have to take the current day's news, quarter's news, year's news into a total perspective and think about 40 and 50 years, which is a hard thing to think about, but that's what our actuaries have to do. And we would have to see some continued time and really get a fundamental differing view, long-term view, on the U.S. economy and inflation targets to fundamentally make -- to make some changes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.
Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Question on Retail. While the earnings were on track, sales came pretty soft on the life insurance and annuity side. So to hit your longer-term targets, I think we'll probably going to need to see that turn around. So can you discuss what's driving the current weakness and where you stand on product introductions? Or are there distribution initiatives to help drive stronger growth?
William J. Wheeler: Nigel, it's Bill. So there are sort of 2 stories here. Both life sales and annuity sales are down -- or variable annuity sales are down significantly year-over-year. And I would say almost all of that is product driven. We -- well, if I take variable annuity sales, we forecast all year. Or when we gave sort of our outlook call last -- late last year, we said that we expected variable annuity sales to be down and that '14 would sort of represent the dip year and then we'd see -- we'd start to see growth in '15. And that's even probably more true than we estimated at the time. I do expect to see growing VA sales, but I think they're going to be timed very closely to the new product rollout that we expect over the next couple of quarters. And we're not in a position to make product rollout announcements today, but there will be new product rollouts coming. And I think that'll strengthen our competitive position in that marketplace. And so I would say it's product driven, not distribution related. With regard to life, a couple things going on there. Again, the third quarter was a little soft, and seasonally, it's always going to be the softest quarter. It -- we changed pricing in term life in the third quarter. And I think -- when that got announced, I think people waited for the new repriced term to come out, and I think that probably made the sales look a little worse than we otherwise would have thought. So I think there will be a recovery in the fourth quarter in term. There is a new product in the competitive scene, indexed universal life, which is garnering a lot of sales. We don't sell that product. And of course, what makes the year-over-year comparison a little more difficult is the sale of no longer selling universal life with lifetime guarantees. There too, we have had some new product introductions, which I think have gotten a lot of interest. And I expect to see sales momentum starting to build in Retail life as well over the next, I would say, 4, 5 quarters. So a bit of a dip this year given all the changes we've made in the Retail business. And I don't think that's really surprising, but we -- but I think we're on the upswing.
Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That's helpful. Just a quick follow-up on the IAIS basic capital requirements. We're hearing that bid rules are likely to be similar. Interested to say whether -- or to hear whether you think that's right, or it's just too early to tell.
Steven A. Kandarian: Nigel, could you repeat that a little bit -- a little slowly?
John C. R. Hele: Let me just -- yes. Nigel, did you say that -- the IAIS capital rules, that it's expected the Fed will use these? Is that what you...
Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Yes, it'd be along the same lines, right.
John C. R. Hele: It is unclear what the Federal Reserve will do. Technically, right now, they're bound by the Collins Amendment, which the Federal Reserve is interpreting to apply basically Basel III to anything that is similar in an insurance company that a bank has. If the current bills in the House and Senate get reconciled and signed by the President, then the Federal Reserve has the freedom, they believe, to adopt different set of rules, but up to now, the Fed has not given any guidance as to how much tailwind that they expect to do. They have said that they will, of course, look at what the IAIS comes up with, in a very similar way that the Federal Reserve looks at what Basel does for banks. The Basel Committee passes basic global rules, Basel III. The Federal Reserve then looks to those rules, interprets them and comes up with standards that they believe are at least as strong as what the Basel III rules are. So I believe they'll be following a similar process when it comes to in rules that apply to nonbank SIFIs, but exactly how that turns out and where it ends up is unknown at this time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I had a question on expenses. So you've already achieved the $600 million net expense save target. So trying to get a sense of, as we look forward from here, how do you think about additional opportunities to improve the consolidated expense ratio going forward.
John C. R. Hele: Ryan, it's John. Yes, as I mentioned, we have realized our goal. I did say and we do expect to be continually focusing on our expense ratios. I think, when we gave our long-term guidance last fall -- last December and we spoke about the various business lines, in general, the goal from here on in is to grow revenues faster than expenses to get that growing margin growth. But the cost saves, the major program that we started in 2012, we are basically there at a run-rate basis.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Is it -- I guess, as a follow-up to that, I think I definitely remember in the international businesses that the goal is, in kind of each case, to grow. Do you expect expense growth to be lower than revenue growth? And it seemed like that might be less the case in the U.S. Should we expect it mostly to be driven by international, with U.S. kind of seeing less opportunity for improvement from here?
John C. R. Hele: Yes, well, we had -- in the fast-growth markets, we expect that to be better. And we do expect a slight improvement in certain of the U.S. businesses, but in some of the larger ones, really far less from this point forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Devine from Jefferies.
Colin Devine: With respect to where you stand in the regulatory front, it's been a pretty busy year, I guess, with New York, notwithstanding what's going on with the Fed. Are there any updates you can give us on where things stand with respect to your use of captive reinsurance? Or how are you looking at reinsurance usage overall now given the changes from New York, ditto on the XXX situation? And then also, perhaps for Steve Goulart, the NAIC is looking at a bunch of different changes to RBC capital requirements on the C1 charges both with the much broader range of bond categories, commercial real estate. How is that impacting your thinking about where you're going to be reinvesting next year even perhaps repositioning the portfolio but to keep the yield up?
John C. R. Hele: Colin, this is John. So when it comes to captives, of course, our variable annuity captive, which is now based in Delaware, will be merged into a set of statutory entities in November this year. This is what we announced last year, and we're on track for that. We have all regulatory approvals to proceed. So that means that sales of variable annuities will no longer be using any seeding to a captive. They'll be in the statutory entities, either the New York company for New York sales or the large non-New York company for non-New York sales. Life captives, we have existing ones in place, but for New York, we don't seed to captives at all. And we don't sell universal life for secondary guarantees anymore, which is what these captives are used for. We don't sell those any place in the U.S., so we have no real net use for the -- for the major use of these captives. There's a small amount of term insurance non-New York that might be used for that. And then I'll turn it over to Steve for the RBC question.
Colin Devine: One question, John, before you do that. Going forward, when you refer to MetLife's RBC, is it going to be just for the New York entity? Or will you start referring to it on a consolidated U.S. basis? Not -- but the[ph] international operations, obviously, but [indiscernible].
John C. R. Hele: Colin, we don't really give it for -- on a consolidated U.S. basis for our primary U.S. statutory entities, and that's the number that I quote on an ongoing basis. And that will be reflecting -- post the merger of all these companies, we'll then reflect the VA captive, which used to be offshore, in that number. So our RBC at the end of this year will reflect all the VA business within the statutory entities.
Colin Devine: Okay. And is there any update on the -- what -- how that will impact your RBC? Is it still the sort of 60 bps there?
John C. R. Hele: We have -- gave some time ago guidance that we expected it to be of above 400% RBC, and we still expect that to be the case.
Colin Devine: Okay. And Steve?
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: Colin, Steve. A couple of comments, I guess, on that. And obviously, we're following what's going on in RBC and potential ratings. It's always an important factor in our investment plan. My understanding, though, is on the -- at least on the bond side, I think there's still a lot of uncertainty on where the NAIC is going to come out on that. The one positive is actually on the mortgage side, where I think it looks like some of the re-ratings there are going to be positive. And of course, given the importance of real estate and mortgages to us, that would be a benefit.
Colin Devine: So you're specifically fine to to meet there [ph]. Is there -- what about also for owned real estate? I mean you've been very successful in it. Does that give you -- if they're going to drop the capital requirement that meaningfully, open up an opportunity to get back into that perhaps a bit more actively and also thinking that you don't face the same sort of mark-to-market fluctuations?
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: Well, I guess, at this point, I couldn't say it'll change our strategy. Remember, real estate equity has always been important to us, and it continues to be a good component of our overall investing strategies, probably more so than some of our peers. So I wouldn't say it would necessarily increase that because you still have to think about overall risk-return and capital requirements.

Operator: Welcome to the MetLife's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors sections of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, further developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Edward A. Spehar: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2014 earnings call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings press release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible, because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported second quarter results, with operating earnings of $1.6 billion. Earnings benefited from strong investment margins in a favorable market environment, but were negatively impacted by weak underwriting results. Operating earnings were essentially flat relative to the second quarter of 2013. Operating earnings per share were $1.39, a 3% decrease from the prior year period. Performance on a per share basis was dampened by the conversion of equity units issued in 2010 to fund the acquisition of ALICO. The final $1 billion tranche of equity units will convert in October of this year. Operating return on equity was 11.4% in the quarter. Investment margins were favorable in the second quarter, variable investment income was strong, driven by bond prepayment fees. And recurring investment margins were stable, even though interest rates were 50 basis points below what we had assumed at the beginning of the year. Despite low interest rates, investment margins have been resilient for 3 main reasons: effective asset liability management; good variable investment income; and income from derivatives, many of which were purchased in the mid-2000s to protect earnings in a low interest rate environment. Second quarter operating earnings were also helped by above average equity market returns. Results this quarter highlight the value of our balanced business mix. As strong investment margins and outperformance in market sensitive lines of business help offset unfavorable underwriting results in certain protection lines of business. I'd like to comment specifically on disappointing underwriting margins and our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits and Retail Life and other segments. Second quarter earnings for Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits were below expectations. The shortfall in this segment was primarily driven by results in disability and dental. In disability, claims severity and an operational issue at one claims management center location led to the underperformance this quarter. Claim severity was 3% above expectations. As for the operational issue, we have brought in new leadership and additional resources to improve claims management. We expect the issue to be corrected by year end. In dental, we believe that above normal utilization in the second quarter reflected the rescheduling of first quarter dentist appointments that were canceled due to the unusually harsh winter. Please recall that we noted low utilization on our first quarter earnings call. On a year-to-date basis, dental utilization is in line with plan. Weak underwriting margins were also an issue in Retail Life and other. While the second quarter was characterized by adverse mortality, the recent trend illustrates that mortality fluctuations can generate both positive and negative surprises to earnings. For example, Retail Life and Other exceeded our plan in the third and fourth quarters of 2013, when mortality was favorable, but fell short of our plan the past 2 quarters due to unfavorable mortality, after adjustments. The timing of large life claims can create earnings volatility in this segment. In the second quarter, we had one large claim associated with the death from a tragic accident, that reduced earnings by $13 million after-tax or $0.01 per share. Moving to capital management. I would like to provide an update on MetLife's program to repurchase up to $1 billion in common stock, which we announced on June 10. Through yesterday, we have repurchased $135 million of stock at an average price of $55.46 per share. Share repurchases were insignificant in the second quarter, given the commencement of the program in late June. As mentioned, when we announced the repurchase program, we will be an opportunistic buyer of our shares. Finally, I would like to comment on the regulatory environment. Uncertainty surrounding potential new regulation is the biggest issue facing MetLife today. However, policymakers in Washington are increasingly aware of the need to tailor the prudential rules for insurance companies. Our position on whether MetLife should be designated a nonbank systemically important financial institution and if so, what rules should apply has been consistent. First, MetLife should not be named a nonbank SIFI by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, because we do not meet the Dodd-Frank Act's criteria for designation. While MetLife is a large financial institution, financial distress at the company would not pose a risk to the financial stability of the United States. We are simply not interconnected enough with the rest of the financial system. Second, for any insurer designated as a nonbank SIFI, or otherwise regulated by the Federal Reserve, the related rules should be appropriate for the business of insurance. I am encouraged that members of Congress have shown broad bipartisan support for legislation to accomplish this goal. On June 3, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved a targeted amendment to Dodd-Frank, clarifying that the Federal Reserve has the authority to tailor capital rules for insurance companies. Companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives already has 182 cosponsors: 103 Republicans and 79 Democrats. In addition, at a congressional hearing earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair, Janet Yellen called the legislation useful, and said that it would "allow us greater latitude in tailoring appropriate regulations." We are hopeful that -- we are hopeful that legislation will be enacted into law this year. Imposing bank centric capital rules on life insurance companies would make it more difficult for Americans to buy products that help protect their financial futures. At a time when government social safety nets are under increasing pressure and corporate pensions are disappearing, public policies should preserve and encourage competitively priced financial protection for consumers. In closing, I would reiterate our view that MetLife's second quarter results highlight the benefit of the company's diverse business mix. Strong investment margins and a favorable market environment help mitigate the impact of a challenging underwriting quarter. We are also pleased to be repurchasing shares again. Something MetLife had not done since early 2008. We understand that returning capital is a key driver of shareholder value over time. And while we continue to take a conservative approach to capital management in light of regulatory uncertainty, I am encouraged by the growing appreciation that the Federal Reserve should have rules that are appropriate for the business of insurance. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. Operating earnings in the second quarter were $1.6 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, and operating earnings per share were $1.39, down 3% year-over-year. This quarter included 3 notable items. First, in Retail Life. We had a reserve adjustment to correct the treatment of the disability waiver rider in a number of term life contracts. This benefited operating earnings by $56 million after-tax or $0.05 per share. Second, in our P&C business. We had higher than budgeted catastrophe losses of $28 million after-tax, which was partially offset by favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million after-tax. Therefore, the net decrease to operating earnings was $21 million or $0.02 per share. Finally, pretax variable investment income was $342 million, reflecting higher bond prepayment fees. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $221 million, which was $11 million, or $0.01 per share, above the top end of our 2014 quarterly guidance range. Turning to our bottom line results. Second quarter net income was $1.3 billion, or $1.17 per share. Net income was $255 million below operating earnings in the quarter. Notable items that explain most of this difference are: number one, charges of $104 million after-tax, associated with asymmetrical accounting treatment for insurance contracts; number two, net investment losses of $81 million after-tax; number three, a loss of $62 million after-tax, related to certain variable annuity guarantees, where the hedge assets that are more sensitive to market fluctuations than the GAAP treatment for guarantee liabilities; and number four, partially offset by derivative net gains of $71 million, after-tax and other adjustments, which reflects the decline in interest rates in the quarter. Book value per share, excluding AOCI was $50.14 at June 30, up 2% from $49.34 at March 31. Turning to second quarter margins. Underwriting in the Americas was less favorable than the prior year quarter and plan. The mortality ratio in Group Life was 87.3% versus 86.5% in the prior year period. Severity was up year-over-year, but improved 6.3 points sequentially. We believe results this quarter were within the range of normal quarterly fluctuations and are in line with the second quarter results over the past several years. Retail Life also had an unfavorable mortality quarter, due to severity. The interest adjusted benefit ratio in Retail Life was 48.9%, reflecting the 6.3 point benefit as a result of the disability wavier reserve adjustment. Excluding this notable benefit, Retail Life interest adjusted ratio was 55.2%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 53.6%. We believe second quarter results reflect normal earnings volatility for this business. While the first 2 quarters of 2014 were characterized by poor mortality, the last 2 quarters of 2013 had favorable mortality. As a result, our fourth quarter average is in line with our long-term mortality results. Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio was 82.6%, unfavorable to the prior quarter of 80.0%. Disability underwriting results were unfavorable to the prior year, due to the lower net closures of existing claims and slightly higher severity. Dental margins were unfavorable to the prior year, driven by higher utilization. On a year-to-date basis, we remain on plan for the dental business. Underwriting in long-term care improved year-over-year, primarily driven by premium rate actions. In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes is 107.5% in Retail and 96.4% in Group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 83.6% in Retail and 86.8% in Group. Despite the higher catastrophes, overall P&C underwriting results were favorable to the prior year quarter, primary due to the lower non-catastrophe accident year losses and prior year development. Finally in Latin America, underwriting results were unfavorable due in part to notable items, including the reserve -- a reinsurance true up and litigation reserve, as well as some higher claims experienced in Mexico worksite marketing. Year-to-date, our Latin America business remains on plan. Moving to second quarter investment margins. The simple average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 221 basis points, which is down 23 basis points versus the prior year. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 195 basis points, down 20 basis points versus the prior year. Our investment margins have remained at attractive levels, despite a multiyear period of low interest rates. The current rate environment has been relatively consistent with the low rate stress scenario we discussed in our 2013 10-K. However, the negative impact on operating earnings in the first half of 2014 has been modestly smaller than what we would have anticipated. With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.2% in the second quarter, as compared to 23.4% in the year ago quarter. Gross expense saves were $211 million in the second quarter, and net saves were $149 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $15 million and onetime costs of $47 million. We were pleased with our expense performance and remain on track to deliver gross saves of $830 million to $860 million in 2014 and $1 billion in 2015, with net saves of $600 million in 2015. I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $652 million, up 12% versus the prior year and up 6%, when adjusting for notable items in both periods. The notable items include the reserve adjustment this quarter, as well as excess variable investment income, higher catastrophes and favorable prior year development in both periods. Retail premiums, fees and other revenues were $3.3 billion, up 8% year-over-year, due to separate account growth and higher income annuity sales. Life and Other reported operating earnings of $253 million, up 19% year-over-year and up 1%, after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The primary drivers were lower expenses, offset by less favorable underwriting. Annuities reported operating earnings of $399 million, up 8% versus the prior year. The primary driver was higher fees from separate account growth due to favorable equity market performance. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, reported operating earnings of $205 million, down 25% year-over-year, primarily due to less favorable results in disability and dental. GVWB premiums, fees and other revenues were $4.3 billion, up 6% due to business growth and experience-related adjustments on participating group life contracts. Corporate benefit funding reported operating earnings of $374 million, up 8% year-over-year, driven by higher investment margins as well as favorable expense margins. Premiums, fees and other revenues were $816 million, up 29% year-over-year, due to increased structured settlement sales and pension closeouts. Latin America reported operating earnings of $160 million, up 28% year-over-year and up 40% on a constant currency basis. These results reflect the Provida acquisition, which continues to perform well. Operating earnings for Provida were above expectations this quarter, primarily due to favorable encaje returns. Adjusting for Provida, operating earnings were down 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, due to onetime items and unfavorable underwriting, partially offset by growth in the region. Looking ahead, we expect tax reform in Chile to be passed in the third quarter. As discussed at our June Investor Day, the proposed tax rate change is an increase from 20% to 25%, phased in over a 4-year period. As a result, we anticipate a onetime charge related to the reduction of the deferred tax asset. This onetime charge is expected to reduce Latin America operating earnings in the third quarter by $40 million to $70 million. In addition to the onetime charge, we believe that 2014 Latin America operating earnings will be dampened by approximately $10 million, with most of that reduction in the third quarter. Premiums, fees and other revenues were $1.1 billion, up 16% year-over-year, 27% on a constant currency basis and 18%, excluding Provida, on a constant currency basis. The strong growth is due to higher premiums related to a government group life policy sale in Mexico, higher annuity sales in Chile and direct marketing in Argentina. Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $319 million, down 3% year-over-year and down 1% on a constant currency basis, primarily reflecting the weakening of the yen. On a constant currency basis, lower surrender fee income from foreign currency denominated fixed annuities in Japan essentially offset business growth in the region and favorable onetime tax items in the current quarter. Premiums, fees and other revenues were $2.3 billion, down 5% year-over-year and down 2% on a constant currency basis, also due to the lower surrender fee revenues in Japan. Asia sales were down 12% year-over-year. As pricing actions in Japan, that we've noted on prior calls, caused a decline in life sales and a related decline in accident and health sales, as A&H is often packaged with life products. Sales were strong elsewhere in Asia, primarily driven by A&H sales in Korea and China. In EMEA, operating earnings were $93 million, up 37% year-over-year, and 41% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers in the quarter were business growth across the region and onetime favorable items, including taxes of $7 million and a $5 million benefit to operating earnings, as a result of eliminating an accounting lag to adjust our businesses in Poland and Slovakia onto a calendar year basis. We would expect a comparable benefit to EMEA operating earnings over the next couple of quarters, as we eliminate the lag accounting in other countries. Premiums fees and other revenues were $712 million, up 3% year-over-year and 1% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in the U.K., Russia, Turkey and the Gulf. Excluding divestitures, mainly Belgium and the negative impact from the Poland pension reform, PFOs were up 6%. Sales for the region increased 3%, with emerging markets up 10%, driven by growth in Poland and Turkey. Finally, the loss in Corporate and Other was $213 million after-tax. This line is volatile, and we think that the second quarter loss was above a normal level. As you model our results for the balance of the year, I would suggest that you consider the average of the second quarter loss of $213 million and the first quarter loss adjusted for notable items of $156 million. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets of the holding companies were approximately $5.5 billion at June 30, which is up from $4.7 billion at March 31. The increase from prior quarter was driven by approximately $900 million of subsidiary dividends. We issued $1 billion of tenure senior debt in the quarter to fund debt maturities and redemptions. Also in the quarter, we paid our quarterly dividend and funded the closing of the Malaysian joint venture, as we discussed at our June Investor Day. Next, I would like to provide you with an update of our capital position. As you know, we report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we'll not have an update for the second quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin was 966%, as of the first quarter of 2014, which is the latest public data. For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary second quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.1 billion, up 72% from the prior year quarter and net income was approximately $900 million, up fivefold. The year-over-year increase in statutory operating earnings was primary due to changes in reserves, included a portion related to the disability wavier, higher separate account fees and favorable interest margins, partially offset by lower underwriting results. In addition to higher operating earnings, the increase in statutory net income year-over-year was also due to lower derivative losses. Our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital is expected to be approximately $28 billion, as of June 30, up 7% compared to December 31. In conclusion, MetLife had a solid second quarter, investment margins remain healthy, expenses are well-controlled, and we continue to focus on generating profitable growth. While operating earnings were dampened by weakness in underwriting, we believe the results reflect the normal volatility in our business. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong, providing us with the flexibility to be opportunistic in managing capital, as we seek to maximize shareholder value. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Ryan Krueger of KBW.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to touch on the group underwriting results. I think for a variety of reasons, they've been a bit soft for a few quarters now. Certainly, I heard your comments about looking to fix the claims management and disability. I guess, the question is that, at this point, do you still feel comfortable with the intermediate term outlook that you provided in December, which I think called for the midpoint of your underwriting target ranges? Or should we be revising that to be slightly weaker going forward?
William J. Wheeler: Ryan, its Bill Wheeler. So we forecasted an improvement in underwriting results year-over-year, at '13 to '14, and we gave those guidance ranges for Group Life and Non-Medical Health. And my expect -- and obviously, Group Life this quarter reverted back to the middle of the guidance range. My expectation is that with Non-Medical Health, while it was at the top end and just above the top end of the guidance range of 77% to 82%, that it, too, will fall in the second half of the year and move back inside the guidance range. Will get all the way to the midpoint? I'm not sure yet, but I do expect the ratios to improve for the latter half of the year.
Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then, a few weeks ago, there were some proposed backstop capital requirements that were released for global insurance SIFIs, which I know doesn't have direct supervisory authority, but I would appreciate any reaction you had to those?
Steven A. Kandarian: Ryan, this is Steve. I think those proposed rules are encouraging, they reflect the insurance business model and they dealt with the basic capital requirements that IAIS was proposing. And our hope is that, that approach is taken up as well in the United States, in terms of putting together an approach that provides the right kind of capital standards for insurance companies using an insurance framework, not a bank framework. However, I think we still caution people that there are other aspects to this kind of capital regime that is being -- which is evolving right now. And there are these higher loss absorbency standards that will apply for globally, systemically important insurers. And we haven't really seen a lot on that yet, so really more to come.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley.
Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just a question on Latin America. I understand you had the adverse mortality in Mexico a bit, but it seems like our results this quarter were mostly still under some pressure, so I'm hoping you can provide some additional data as to what's kind of driving that business.
Steven A. Kandarian: Nigel, can you just speak a little more slowly, because it's breaking up on our side.
Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Sure, so a question on Latin America. I understand you had the adverse mortality in Mexico but still same slight results, even excluding that we're under some pressure. So hoping you can provide some details as to what's driving that? Is it a reflection of, say, more volatile markets, spending on growth initiatives? Any color there would be helpful.
Steven A. Kandarian: Sure, Nigel. So a little color on Latin America in terms of the underperformance. So as John Hele mentioned, we had both relatively weak underwriting in our Mexican worksite marketing business. Now this is a business we've obviously been running for a long time, and it's actually very steady. But we do see some movement in volatility and mortality volatility. And we had a blip up this quarter. So that obviously was a big portion of the difference versus expectations. As I think, it was also mentioned, we had a -- just a group of, I would say, smaller onetime adjustments, things like a reinsurance true up, a litigation reserve. In total, they would have been something in the order of $10 million to $15 million after-tax in terms of results. So I think when you kind of reflect both of those variances in the quarter, you realize that otherwise Latin America had a relatively good quarter or a quarter of near expectations. And obviously, a part -- a big part of that is Provida, and Provida obviously is doing very well and had a very, I don't know if I would -- how unusual I would call it, but certainly a strong quarter with regard to encaje performance.
Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Great. Then just a question on long-term care. One of your peers saw a sharp increase in severity. Yes, I know that you actually had improvement in underwriting results from the previous year, but any shift that you're seeing with regards to severity trends, which potentially could emerge as a concern for your operations?
Steven A. Kandarian: Nigel, could you repeat the last part of that question, please?
Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Sure. Any shifts in severity, that you're seeing in severity across your operations, which potentially could emerge as a concern?
John C. R. Hele: This is John. According to long-term care, we've not seeing any major changes other than what we've been expecting, as we have seen an increase in earnings, and we are getting the rate increases that we had assumed generally that we had hope to get. We don't get it in every state, but it is according to our plans that we've laid out so far. And so it's really where we had expected it to be.
Operator: Our next question will come from Mr. Tom Gallagher of Crédit Suisse.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: First, just a quick question on the disability claims handling issue. Steve, you had mentioned that, you would expect that to be corrected by the end of the year. So does that imply that we're going to see margins overall and the group business remain on the soft side? Meaning, are we likely to see disability loss ratios remain high there, for the next couple of quarters here?
William J. Wheeler: Tom, it's Bill. I do think disability results will improve, even in the third and fourth quarter. Again, they probably won't get back to our original expectation that we laid out last December, though we didn't, obviously, mention disability specifically, but there -- but I do think disability will probably improve in the third and the fourth, mainly because of some IBNR reserves we put up in the first and second quarter, and those won't recur in the third and fourth quarter. And so given everything else, that should be see some improvement our way. But I don't -- but I think it's right that we -- in terms of the operational issue and then its impact on our financials, you won't see an improvement, really, in probably until 2015.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And Bill, how material were those IBNR reserves you've put up in 1Q and 2Q, for disability?
William J. Wheeler: Well, they weren't -- they don't -- they only -- they explain a part of the variance in our disability performance. There -- I would say if you think of the 3 -- the other reasons that Steve laid out with regard to claims severity and also our operational issue, there -- that would be the third to the 3 reasons.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just my follow-up is, on the corporate side, the loss this quarter was above the high end of guidance, if you just spread it out and looked at it on a quarterly basis. So I guess, for John, should we still take the initial guide that you put up in corporate and other to be a reasonable range? Meaning, are we likely to see the corporate other experience in the loss shrink meaningfully from current levels or can you -- any help with that?
William J. Wheeler: Sure. So corporate's a very hard thing to forecast, obviously, and there is a lot of pieces in there. This quarter we said was above what we think is a normal run rate. We had some onetime expenses with various cost-saving programs. We had a tax booking in there that was more a timing issue. So what I said in my text was that if you take the -- this quarter, the 2013 and the first quarter, adjusted of for notable items, we talked about in the first quarter, that would be $156 million and just sort of average that, within that would be the more appropriate sort of run rate.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And actually, if I could just sneak in one more for Bill Wheeler. The -- a competitor of yours reported exceptionally strong sales in their group business last night. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the sales front in the group business, whether its life insurance, disability or dental?
William J. Wheeler: Yes, I would say that the environment is okay and it's constructive. I don't think it's -- I would not say it was very aggressive. Our sales levels in group have been good so far this season. And so -- and where we need to get renewal increases, we've been able to get them. So I think it's -- I would view the overall environment as pretty good.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Seth Weiss of Bank of America.
Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I wanted to just ask about Latin American sales, and I know that was a big one timer in terms of group contracts sold in and I believe in Mexico, but outside of that, could you give us a sense of how sales growth looked like in Latin America?
William J. Wheeler: Sure, Seth. It's Bill again. So we obviously had very high reported sales growth, well north of 50%, or I think the number actually might have been close to 80% sales growth. But that was really driven by a very large government group contract in Mexico. If you just adjust for that and nothing else, then sales growth will look pretty flat. It increased 3% year-over-year. And so a couple of other data points I'd give you, because that's -- obviously, 3% is not our normal expectation, but we didn't try to kind of smooth sales for any other lumpy sales we might have had, either in this period or the year ago period. In the first quarter, for instance, we had sales growth year-over-year of 13%. And if you look at our revenue growth in Latin America year-over-year, it's obviously very good and even when you would take out things like Provida and adjust for currency, it's still double digit. And that's our expectation in terms of top line growth in Latin America, both sort of for sales and for revenues is that we would have double digit. And even though, this sales -- the quarter of this sales level was a little low, adjusted for the big contract, I think double digit is sort of the right level that we should get going forward.
Operator: We have a question from the line of Joanne Smith of Scotia Capital.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division: Yes, in terms of the corporate expenses, I just want to go back that for a minute. What are you doing in terms of regulatory and compliance spend and in terms of gearing up to potentially meet the challenges of being a nonbank SIFI?
John C. R. Hele: Joanne, this is John. So within some of these numbers are some of our costs for this. Right now, of course, we're still in stage 3 with the FSOC and they've asked us for a lot of information. We've been providing that to them. But that's really the extent of it. We have a lot of planning underway, of course, if we are named, but it's still early days right now for us to really understand the true cost impact over time. We also have costs in there for FATCA and some other renew regulations that are taking effect right now as well. But so it's -- it is included, but as I said, the $213 million this quarter is above our normal -- our current running rate for this year.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division: John, have you looked at some of the spending at the banks to comply with the new capital regime? Because it seems to me that the expenses have been a lot higher than I think anybody had anticipated, and they continue to go up. So when you're doing your planning, have you taken that into consideration?
John C. R. Hele: We're taking a wide range of thought into consideration. It is unclear as to how much regulatory burden it will be for insurers, compared to some banks. I mean, we're in different businesses. It's different, I think, for banks even if you're in retail versus wholesale, and it varies from bank to bank and from place to place. So it's still a learning experience, I think, for all insurers who are SIFIs or who maybe designated as SIFIs.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division: Okay. And then, I just wanted to go back to the disability issue real quick and just -- have you determined that there are any pricing or other underwriting changes that need to be made? I understand the claims issue, but is there a pricing issue as well?
William J. Wheeler: Joanne, it -- I wouldn't say there's a pricing issue per say, but we're obviously, at this renewal season, where we have cases that are underwater and not performing at expectations. We're seeking renewals that will alleviate that issue. And I would just say, in general, we are being more aggressive about disability pricing this sale season than we have been in recent years.
John C. R. Hele: Joanne, this is John. In our last call, we had -- I had mentioned that we were putting through selective price increases in the disability line.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division: Okay, but nothing beyond what you said in the last call?
Steven A. Kandarian: That's right.
John C. R. Hele: Yes.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of John Nadel of Sterne Agee.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I just had a question. Gosh, I hate to beat up on corporate this much on your call, but if we're averaging the first half of the year, it looks like the full year is going to be at the upper end of your range in terms of loss. I just want to clarify, does that still include $160 million to $200 million of after-tax sort of onetime costs related to expense initiatives? Is that still your expectation for 2014?
John C. R. Hele: Well, I would -- I think your calculations seem to be correct. It's within the range. It's why we gave a large range. Corporate and Other does vary from quarter-to-quarter, from year-to-year. And it is the total inclusive of all the expenses and information that we put into Corporate. So the answer is yes.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Yes -- no, I just wanted to confirm that the $160 million to $200 million is still a good -- is still the reasonable number, in terms of those onetime costs?
John C. R. Hele: Yes, it's in that ballpark, I mean, and it's within the total range of what we had said.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, maybe a bigger picture question, coming back to the regulatory front. The Wall Street Journal ran an article, I think it was earlier this week, might have been late last week that discussed maybe a hangup as it relates to tailoring rules for insurance companies, that Dodd-Frank is essentially would prevent the use of ratings or rating agency ratings as a means of determining the risk associated with the fixed income holdings. I'm just curious whether you guys think that, that's a real issue. And if so, what kind of workaround that issue has been discussed with regulators?
Steven A. Kandarian: John, it's Steve. Dodd-Frank does limit the use by the Fed of third party rating agencies. We do think that risk rating of assets is likely to be part of the model they use when they regulate insurance companies. And we think there will be some sort of a workaround. The banks have internal rating systems. The Basel Committee is looking now at harmonizing these kind of systems across the bank regulatory regimes. And I think there will be an evolution in this area that will occur over some period of time that will take into effect the risk weighting of assets. It will surprise me if regulators didn't take into effect, as they regulated entities for soundness and safety, the riskiness of the assets that they were holding. So I think there will be some way to address this issue that was raised in the article you noted.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. I mean, we did see during the financial crisis, PIMCO and BlackRock were used a third-party source for some of the asset backed securities. So that seems to me this can be worked around, too. And just a last quick one. I don't suppose there's anything to announce in the conference call, but there was speculation that FSOC was going to vote on Met either yesterday or today. Is there any update you can provide?
Steven A. Kandarian: John, we don't know when FSOC will vote. They don't tell us that.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Suneet Kamath of UBS.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: John, in your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned an earnings benefit from a true up of a lag. I think some of your operations were on a -- I don't know if it's a 1 month lag or whatever. So I'm just wondering if you can go through that again, and then also, are there any other significant operations that are still reported on a lag basis that might be trued up in the future?
John C. R. Hele: Yes. So some of the businesses actually from ALICO are driven on a -- reporting on a lag, a 1 month lag there. It's small. It's immaterial for the whole group. We are working to move these through. And we have seen it here in EMEA, this quarter has a $5 million benefit, and we expect the benefit in the next few quarters as we take more countries in EMEA off the lag.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, but there's nothing major in terms of regions that still on a lag that can be trued up?
John C. R. Hele: These ones are small. So they're just -- it just flows through operating earnings, because it's immaterial to the whole company. The one remaining group that does -- or was still -- is still on a 1 month lag is Japan. We expect that would be off for 2016, but that will flow through the balance sheet, that change, because it's a large amount.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then, I think in your prepared remarks, also John, you'd mentioned that the impact from lower rates was smaller than what you would have expected in the first half of the year. Is that simply because variable investment income was better? Or what were some of the drivers behind that?
John C. R. Hele: Well, I think our sensitivity, we published in the 10-K, was 2.5% flat for the year and rates weren't 2.5 on average in the first quarter. They were a little above that. And so it wasn't quite as bad as we had put in our sensitivity.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And have you changed your outlook for rates in the balance of the year? I think your original expectation was that the 10 year would be -- I forget what the number was -- but 3 something by the end of this year. Have you changed your thoughts around that?
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: It's Steve Goulart. You're right. I think our original plan was based on Bloomberg consensus at that time, which, I think, was 336 [ph] on the 10 year. Obviously, consensus has come down during the course of the year. And we sort of reflect that as we go through our projecting process. Our view has been that the consensus was probably a little bit more aggressive on rates rising than we thought would happen anyway. So I'd say that we've been operating as we expected for most of this year, and our outlook continues to reflect that.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Randy Binner of FBR Capital Markets.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: I want to go back to the disability issue. I guess, I may have missed this, but the claims management operational issue that was referenced, could you expand on exactly what that operational issue was and kind of what can be done to turn it around? It sounded like from the commentary that things turnaround pretty quickly. So just trying to get some understanding of what that operational issue was.
Steven A. Kandarian: Sure, Randy. So we manage group disability claims out of 4 locations. And there -- and in one of our offices, we've seen a real slip in, and I would see our claims management metrics. And we feel that this is operationally driven, not underwriting driven or anything else. And so what we've done is we've brought in our best claims management people in the company, change the managerial structure there. And I think we're just going to -- you're going to see a focus in terms of our procedures regarding claims management over the next 6 months. We -- it's a manageable issue, and our expectation is that it can be adjusted pretty quickly.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay. So nothing outside of just folks not following, I guess, the best procedures, so just kind of standard claim stuff, nothing outside of that?
Steven A. Kandarian: Yes, that's right.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: I wanted to try one on just on buyback real quick, if I can. I heard the equity units' commentary in the opening description and there's 1 billion authorization. I think that's ostensibly to kind of offset the dilution, but I mean, imagine that we continue to have regulatory uncertainty, which seems to be a good assumption, is -- can Met operate a buyback program kind of beyond just offsetting equity unit dilution? I mean, this is capital management in the form of buyback something that can be explored, assuming there's continued regulatory uncertainty?
Steven A. Kandarian: Randy, as you know, we were cautious and remain cautious in terms of capital management, because of the uncertainty. And we give -- the reasoning behind the program we have currently, the $1 billion, which we think is a modest program, because of the delay in both the ruling around designation in MetLife potentially as a nonbank SIFI and also seeing a draft of the rules. And at this point, we really can't say much more because we, again, have not seen the rules. We've not been designated as of yet. And until we have more information, it's been difficult for us to answer that question. I will simply say that as I noted in my prepared remarks, returning capital to shareholders is a high priority for us. We had to do that consistent with the regulatory environment in which we find ourselves. And as we learn more about that, we'll have more to say.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Sean Dargan of Macquarie.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research: I had a question about the Japan sales outlook and the impact of the pricing increases?
Christopher G. Townsend: The Japan sales increase in what?
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research: I'm sorry, the outlook for Japan sales, was there a reference to the impact of a pricing increase in the prepared remarks?
Christopher G. Townsend: Yes, there was. And this is Chris Townsend for Asia. So the reference that John made was just in repricing of our yen life-based products, which was -- the actions were taken at the backend of last year, and that will drag through this year in terms of the sales impact going forward. So what you're seeing there is that sales for Asia are down about 12%. We've had pretty good growth in non-Japan Asia, particularly, areas like China, which is up about 30%. But in Japan itself, the actions we've taken have been not only of the pricing, but we've also changed some of the commissions to make sure that the behaviors we want are representative in terms of long-term persistency of relationship with our clients. So as the life sales are impacted because of that repricing, there is an impact, obviously, in terms of the package and what you've spoken about before. But going forward, what you'll see, and this will be about September time of this year, we will relaunch one of the yen-based life products, which will be more competitive and will be very much in the acceptable return area and also a range of A&H products and medical products, which will help the competitiveness and help some of the features and benefits. So sales will drag through third quarter, they will -- but they'll rebound by the end of the year and give us a good fast start into 2015.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research: And then, just a question about EMEA. Has there been any noticeable impact from the conflict in Ukraine and Russia?
Michel Khalaf: Sean, this is Michel Khalaf. So we have seen a drop in sales in Russia. That's primarily due to the slowdown in the economy. And that's reflective of the fact that our overall growth for the region is below the level that we expect it to be at. So we are obviously -- and we have a diverse business in Russia and multiple channels and multiple product lines. We are seeing an impact and -- but we're also able to adjust our expense structure. So as long as the impact is short term, it is not impacting our bottom line in Russia. We are obviously monitoring the situation very closely.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Chris Giovanni of Goldman Sachs.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: PFC earlier talked about suggestions or proposals they're making on pension reform in Chile. I'm wondering what your views are and what you're communicating to regulators on that topic?
William J. Wheeler: Chris, it's Bill Wheeler. So we're engaged in a very big -- along with Principal and the other members of the industry down there, we're engaged in a big dialogue with the Chilean government. They've convened, I guess, I'd call it a blue ribbon panel of experts, both Chileans and from then the rest of the world, to study issues regarding the pension system there, which has really been a success, but they're looking for ways to make it better. And do things like improved coverage and making sure that all members of Chilean society participate and things like that. And so this blue ribbon panel is in the middle of -- they're holding hearings. We've recently testified before the panel, giving our opinion about what should happen. And what we think is -- it works and needs to improve. And I think Principal did too, as well as other members of the industry, they're going to release a report in the fall sort of with sort of observations. And then in January, the expectation is that they will then release the report with recommendations, which will form the basis of what the government might do in terms of making changes to the pension system. So I think it's a thoughtful process, and I think the Bachelet government, based on the discussions we've had with them are, they want to make sure that the pension system continues to be successful, but they at the same time, want to make sure that there are improvements. I would not call this the Bachelet government's highest priority in terms of what they want to get through legislatively. They have a number of other agenda items they want to work on. So I don't -- this isn't a centerpiece of what they're focused on, but it's -- that's the process that's going on.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then for Steve, when you were a bank holding company, you obviously were subject to stress testing and bank capital ratio metrics. I know, at the time, you disagreed a bit in terms of where your internal ratios maybe came out versus the Fed. But I'm wondering if you still update those estimates and if so, how those bank ratios have maybe changed over the past few years?
John C. R. Hele: Well, this is John. We have our own internal stress testing system that we run from a government's point of view. We used to have to provide this information when we were governed under the New York Fed, when we had a bank. We don't have a bank anymore. We don't provide anything to them. Basel I calculations don't make any sense for an insurance company, and nor that Basel I is even used anymore. So we have our own internal system, but we've not done things that are in sort of a bank sense for the Basel III. And we don't know what the capital rules will be, that the Federal Reserve will be introducing, nor when they might introduce them. So we will have to wait and see when they come up with something. Obviously, if we become a SIFI, we will start to do those calculations and see how all that works out, but it's still too -- way too early to understand what's going on there.
Steven A. Kandarian: Okay. We are just about 9:00. So thank you for your participation and have a good day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we like to thank you for standing by and welcome to the MetLife's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements relating to the trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the  forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission including the risk factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.
Ed Spehar: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's first quarter 2014 earnings call. We’ll be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles so called non-GAAP measures reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found in the Investor Relations portion metlife.com in our earnings press release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment income and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management including Bill Wheeler, President of the Americas, Chris Townsend, President of Asia and Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA and Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer. With that I would like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Kandarian: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report solid first quarter results with operating earnings of $1.6 billion, which exceeded our plan. Favorable investment margins and well-controlled expenses more than offset fluctuations in underwriting and $57 million after-tax charge to settle a licensing matter in New York. We anticipate that underwriting margins will improve and consider the New York settlement to be an unusual item. While operating earnings were better than our expectations results were down 5% from a strong first quarter last year. Operating earnings in the prior year quarter benefited from a weaker dollar and stronger equity market returns. Operating earnings per share were $1.37; a 7% decrease in the prior year period. Performance on a per share basis was dampened by the conversion of equity units issued in 2010 to fund the acquisition of Alico. The final $1 billion tranche of equity units will convert in October of this year. Operating return on equity was 11.4% in the quarter. First quarter operating earnings benefited from strong variable investment income driven by returns in private equity. The operating earnings impacting variable investment income was $63 million above the top end of our expected range or $0.06 per share. Investment margins had been resilient despite a prolonged period of low interest rates. Our margins continue to benefit from effective asset liability management, good global investment income and income from derivatives many of which were purchased in the mid-2000s, protect earnings in a low interest rate environment. Lower operating expenses had a positive impact on earnings in the quarter driven by expense control in all three geographic regions, the Americas, Asia, and Europe, Middle East and Africa. We feel good that our cost savings initiatives are translating to improve bottom line results. Underwriting margins were lower than expected in retail life and group voluntary and worksite benefit largely because of adverse mortality. We believe underwriting margins will improve for two reasons. First, our analysis suggests that most of the adverse experience in the first quarter was a result of normal volatility. Second, there is seasonality in our business with underwriting margins typically weakest in the first quarter of the year. Given the underwriting performance this quarter, it is worth reviewing, how we think about risk associated with protection oriented products. Our strategy to shift the sales mix away from market sensitive products, protection oriented products should translate to a more balanced risk profile and a reduction in so-called fat-tail risk. For protection products, we think the primary risk factor is earnings volatility as policyholder claims will sometimes exceed pricing assumptions. We view the balance sheet risk associated with protection products as relatively modest. This is true in group insurance where we have the ability to reprice the in-force book of business in the near-term. Overall, protection oriented product lines have a favorable risk profile in a relatively low cost of equity capital. Although, it may seem counterintuitive, in this case, low risk does not mean lower returns. For example, group voluntary and worksite benefits remains a high return segment, even with the less favorable underwriting results experienced in recent periods, largely because of relatively low capital requirements. A healthy spread between ROE and the cost of equity capital is particularly important in the current environment were capital requirements remain uncertain. Our strategy to shift MetLife's sales mix to a protection oriented products was clearly evident in our first quarter results. Group voluntary and worksite benefits sales rose 18% and emerging market sales were up 14%. Variable annuity sales were $1.6 billion in the first quarter, down 54% year-over-year. However, the decline was only 4% sequentially, even though first quarter sales are typically weaker than fourth quarter sales. Since 2012, we're focused on rightsizing our variable annuity business to achieve an appropriate risk profile. Consistent with the December outlook call, we anticipate that variable annuity sales would decline this year. Looking forward, we are now in a position to pursue sales growth with our redesigned mix of products to have a more attractive risk return profile. We remain committed to the annuity business as we see a substantial retirement savings opportunity in the United States. Next, I want to address the legal settlement in the licensing matter in New York, which is related to our global employee benefits business. Let me start by noting that I'm limited in what I can say the terms of the settlement agreement. New York officials investigated whether companies we acquired for the 2010 Alico transaction were conducting insurance business in the state without a New York license. The company's MetLife acquired are in a business that provides insurance to the non-U.S. employees of multinational companies. This insurance is sold through affiliates and partners that are licensed in the countries where the insurance policies are issued. Under the terms of the agreement with the New York Department of Financial Services, we can continue to have meetings and discussions in New York with multinational clients and prospects about the capabilities of MetLife's non-U.S. affiliates and partners. We're pleased to settle this issue with the Department of Financial Services particularly because our largest operating subsidiary is a New York regulated insurer. Finally, I want to close the discussion of required capital and capital management. MetLife remains under states to review by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the potential designation as a non-bank Systemically Important Financial Institution or SIFI. We believe the evidence clearly demonstrates that MetLife does not pose a threat to the financial system of the United States. However, if MetLife is designated a SIFI, we will be subject to enhanced credential standards by the Federal Reserve because those standards have not yet been written, there is uncertainty surrounding required capital levels for MetLife. As a result, we've been conservative on capital management. Some shareholders have been frustrated by this cautious approach to returning cash. We share their frustration. Our philosophy is that excess capital belongs to our shareholders. The challenge is to strike the right balance between adherence to our philosophy and recognition that record capital levels for MetLife remain unknown. We had anticipated that proposed capital rules would have been known by now. But, recent comments from the Federal Reserve suggest that it will be 2015 before you'll see draft capital rules for life insurers designated as SIFIs. We will continue to take the conservative approach to capital management until there is clarity on these matters. But, we also recognize the need to consider the timing of those rules as our capital base continues to grow. The announcement last week of a 27% increase in MetLife's common stock dividend illustrates the importance that we place on returning cash to shareholders. In closing, 2014 is off to a good start. The increase in the common stock dividend illustrates our confidence in the earnings power of the company. By significantly increasing the dividend, we are delivering on our commitment to take steps to enhance long-term shareholders value. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John Hele: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. As Steve noted, operating earnings were $1.6 billion, down 4% year-over-year and operating earnings per share were $1.37 down 7% year-over-year. This quarter included two notable items. First, pretax variable investment income was $429 million, reflecting strong private equity returns. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $274 million which is $63 million or $0.06 per share above the top end of our 2014 quarterly guidance range. The second item was a legal settlement with New York, which reduced operating earnings and corporate and other by $57 million after tax or $0.05 per share. Turning to our bottom line results, first quarter net income was $1.3 billion or $1.14 per share. Net income included in investment loss of $343 million after tax from the previously announced sale of the U.K. pension risk transfer business. This was modestly below the $350 million to $390 million after tax range we previously disclosed. In addition, net income included net derivative gains of $223 million after tax. The net derivative gains in the quarter were driven primarily by three items that we consider to be either non-economic or the result of asymmetrical accounting treatment. Number one, a decline in long-term interest rates, number two changes in foreign currencies and number three, the MetLife own credit impact associated with our VA program. The decline in long-term interest rates in the quarter contributed approximately 70% of the net derivative gains, while foreign currency and MetLife's own credit combined for most of the remaining balance. Book value per share excluding AOCI was $49.34 at March 31st, up 2% from $48.49 at December 31st. Turning to first quarter margins, underwriting in the U.S. was less favorable than the prior year quarter and our plan. The mortality ratio in Group Life was 93.6% unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 91.3% and above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. First quarter mortality is usually higher due to seasonality. We experienced an  elevated number of large claims in determining group variable universal life, which we believe was still – was in the range of normal quarterly fluctuations. Retail Life also had unfavorable mortality quarter due to the three primary factors. One, two large claims in variable and universal life; two, higher than normal incidence in traditional life; and three, a reinsurance adjustment related to prior periods. On the last point, we'd incorrectly recorded policies that were term life conversions as reinsured over several years and as a result now had to reimburse reinsurers for claims that occurred between 2006 and 2011. This catch-up adjustment reduced operating earnings by $16 million after tax in the quarter. We're not normalizing for this reinsurance adjustment as we typically do not normalize for mortality related items. In the quarterly financial supplement, you will note a change in how we are showing mortality experience. We have replaced the historical Retail Life direct mortality ratio with an interest adjusted benefit ratio. The historical ratio reflected direct claims experience as a percentage of expected. The new ratio measures claims experience net of reinsurance and changes in future policyholder benefits net of interest relative to premiums fees and other revenues. We believe the new ratio will better demonstrate the relationship of mortality experience to premiums earned and prove your ability to model this business. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Retail Life was 56.9% in the first quarter, which is unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 52.1% and our target range of 50% to 55%. While we are changing the mortality metric, we will discuss with you going forward, there is no change in the expected mortality experience for our Retail Life business. We've also changed the non-medical health benefit ratio in the QFS to an interest adjusted loss ratio. The primary reason to the changes to provide a better indication of the underlying performance of our run-off launch and care insurance block of business. On the old basis, it would've been upward pressure on the benefit ratio as premiums declined and investment income increased and this upward pressure would have nothing to do with the underlying performance of the business. The new ratio adjusts for this by removing the impact of interest on reserves, and therefore, provides a clear picture of morbidity margins. The non-medical health interest adjusted loss ratio was 78.8% favorable to the prior year quarter of 79.6% and within our target range of 77% to 82%. The 77% to 82% target range for the interest adjusted loss ratio is consistent with the old range of 86% to 90% on premiums. General margins were favorable to prior year and plan due to lower utilization. Disability underwriting results were unfavorable to prior year and plan due to lower net closures of existing claims. As part of our normal review process we're pursuing modest price increases in disability. However, it is important to keep in mind that dental is the primary driver of our results in non-medical health. Dental accounts for more than 60% of our non-medical health interest adjusted loss ratio, while disability only accounts for 20%. Long-term care, which accounts for approximately 10% of the ratio, had favorable underwriting versus prior year quarter and plan driven by premium rate actions and lower incidence. In our P&C business, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 94.3% for retail and 98.2% for group. The combined ratios excluding catastrophes were 89.3% in retail and 94.3% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting results were unfavorable to the prior year quarter and plan primarily due to non-catastrophe launches as a result of the winter weather. Moving to first quarter investment margins, the simple average of the four U.S. products spreads in our QFS was 233 basis points including variable investment income and 192 basis points excluding VII. This result showed only a modest seven basis points decline versus the prior year quarter of 240 basis points including VII. Excluding VII, there was a 19 basis points decline versus the prior year quarter due to the low interest rate environment. With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 24.1% in the first quarter as compared to 24.0% in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for the New York legal settlement, the normalized operating expense ratio was 23.6% better than plan than the prior-year quarter. Gross expense saves were $200 million in the first quarter and net saves were $124 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $39 million and one-time costs of $37 million. We are pleased with our expense performance as we remain on track to deliver gross saves of $770 million to $800 million in 2014, and $1 billion in 2015, and net saves of $600 million in 2015. I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $612 million, down 2% versus the prior year quarter and up 1% when adjusting for notable items in both periods, included in net positive DAC and reserve adjustment in the prior year quarter an excess variable investment income in both periods. Life and other reported operating earnings of $244 million, down 4% year-over-year and down 5% when adjusting for excess and variable investment income in both quarters. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting partially offset by lower expenses. Annuities reported operating earnings of $368 million, down 1% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding a net positive DAC and reserve adjustment of $29 million in the prior year quarter an excess variable investment income in both periods, operating earnings were up 5%. The drivers included lower DAC amortization and higher fees from separate account growth. Group, voluntary and worksite benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $188 million down 18% year-over-year due to a less favorable underwriting in Group Life disability and property and casualty partially offset by improved underwriting results in dental and long-term care. GVWB sales were up 18% up year-over-year with group sales up in the mid-teens and voluntary and worksite sales up more than 30%. Even though we're modestly increasing disability pricing over the next year, we believe that first quarter GVWB sales would generate an attractive return on investment. Corporate benefit funding reported operating earnings of $355 million, up 21% year-over-year driven by higher variable investment and return income as well as improved underwriting. Latin America reported operating earnings of $183 million, up 28% year-over-year and 43% on a constant currency basis. These results reflected the ProVida acquisition, which was in line with expectations and favorable market and tax impact partially offset by less favorable underwriting and higher expenses due to business initiatives, inflation adjustments and volume related growth. Premiums fees and other revenues were up 9% year-over-year, 22% on a constant currency basis and 12% excluding ProVida on a constant currency basis. The strong growth across the region was primarily due to higher annuity sales in Chile and worksite marketing in Mexico. Sales were up 19% year-over-year and 15% excluding ProVida driven by growth in the agency sales force higher annuity sales, direct marketing and group medical in Chile as well as group medical in Mexico. Turning now to Asia, operating earnings were $328 million, down 2% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, operating earnings were up 8% driven by business growth and lower expenses partially offset by return to more normal surrender levels in Japan. While Asia operating earnings were strong this quarter they did benefit from the timing of certain expenses. Premiums fees and other revenues were down 6% year-over-year but up 6% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth in Japan, Korea and Australia. Asia sales were up only 2% year-over-year dampened by results in Japan. Japan sales were flat as a strong rebound in retirement products was offset by decline in yen life sales due to pricing actions we discussed on our fourth quarter call. As a result, the volume mix is favorable for expected returns. Finally, in EMEA, operating earnings were $88 million, up 1% year-over-year and 2% on a constant currency basis. The prior period benefited by $8 million from unusual items increase. Adjusting for these items, operating earnings were up 12% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth across the region. This was a strong quarter for EMEA and we would expect lower operating earnings in the remaining quarters of the year. Premiums fees and other revenues were up 5% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis driven by growth in Turkey, Russia, the Gulf and Poland. Sales increased 4% driven by 9% growth in emerging markets led by the Gulf, Turkey and Poland. I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding company were approximately $4.7 billion at March 31st. As expected, this decline from year-end was primarily due to the $1 billion of senior debt that matured in February. Turning to our capital position, the combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies excluding Alico at year-end 2013 was 450%. Also our Japan solvency ratio was 945% as of December 31st. For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $760 million, down 4% from the prior year quarter and net income was approximately $666 million, up 18%. The year-over-year decline in statutory operating earnings was primarily due to higher taxes, while the increase in net income was primarily the result of lower derivative losses. Our total statutory adjusted capital is expected to be approximately $27 billion as of March 31st, up 4% compared to December 31st. In conclusion, MetLife had a solid first quarter with operating earnings better than our plan. Investment margins remain healthy, expenses are well-controlled and we continued focus on generating profitable growth. Although underwriting was weaker than expected in the quarter, we expect results to improve during the balance of the year. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Ed Spehar: We are ready to take questions operator.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session of our conference. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Gallagher of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse: Good morning. Steve, first question for you just on your follow-up to your comments on the environment for capital rules and how you expect clarity around non-bank SIFI to be pushed out to 2015. There is currently legislation running through both the House and Senate to clarify Collins' amendment. If that legislation passes, will that change your view in terms of having to wait or will that give you enough confidence that you'd be able to do something less conservative? That's my first question.
Steve Kandarian: Hi, Tom. Yes. There's legislation now proposed both in the House and the Senate and then there is Susan Collins from there's an amendment named in Dodd-Frank, which is Section 171 of Dodd-Frank was interpreted by the Federal Reserve as requiring them to use no less than bank standards for non-bank SIFI such as insurance companies. And there is now a bill that Susan Collins, Sherrod Brown and Mike Johanns in the Senate have coalesced behind S.2270. There is an identical bill now in the house HR 4510, again, bipartisan support by representatives Gary Miller and Carolyn McCarthy. That's all encouraging news, but of course, these be a vehicle by which this would turn into legislation not just a bill and to-date there has been resistance to any amendments to Dodd-Frank, a bill that's been promulgated now for four years this summer. So our hope is that there will be some softening of the position of not opening up Dodd-Frank for amendments. And it's not unusual for a very complex bill to have technical amendments after some period of time. And our hope is that Congress can find a way to navigate these issues and get these kinds of technical amendments or non-partisan, excuse me, bipartisan non-controversial through Congress and signed by the President. That's our hope and we're working hard to try to support those efforts. If such a bill were to pass, that would be very favorable news, but I don't want to over blow it either. All I would say is to the Fed that you're not constrained, you are hands are not tied in terms of opposing Basel rules on the insurance industry. It doesn't say what rules they would apply but presumably they would be more tailored to the insurance industry I think that certainly would be a net positive so that would be a positive piece of information that we certainly would take into account as we thought about capital management.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse: So if it does pass positive directionally, maybe, maybe not enough for you to change your plan for now? Is that a fair way to characterize it?
Steve Kandarian: I wouldn't phrase it that way. I think there would be positive news and certainly that we take that into account as we thought about capital management and that could have an impact upon how we would move forward.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one I guess business question from the standpoint of so Met and the rest of the life insurance industry now this quarter have had pretty weak mortality results across the board. We've seen more pockets of this over the last few years. Any thoughts overall about whether this is truly just seasonality and randomness of more deaths this quarter? Or do you think we're seeing something more structural in terms of seasoning of more aggressive pricing years any help or color on that would be appreciated.
Bill Wheeler: Tom, hi, it's Bill Wheeler. So we ask ourselves that question when we have a quarter like this. We look at the claims and the data, our overall book, we look at, we always go back and look at the last five years or 10 years and say gee, am I missing a trend here, is there something I should be paranoid about in terms of our underwriting or pricing. So we examine this really carefully. And I think our conclusion after this quarter is, there isn't a trend, there isn't something that we need a deeper concern that we need to be worried about. What we saw was some increases in severity, both in the Individual Life block as well as Group Life. And maybe just a slight increase in frequency in Retail Life, which probably brought on by the weather. And we know that happen, right? We see quarters occasionally like this where you have a big pop in severity. And of course, this quarter in Retail Life, which wasn't very good, just remember the third and fourth quarter last year we're extraordinarily low in terms of mortality experience very good mortality experience. So I think we just have to appreciate that this can be a volatile business. And as Steve said in his prepared remarks, it doesn't mean, it's not a good business and with great returns on capital, but mortality over the short-term can be volatile and so you've just got to take a little longer term view.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse: Got it. So Bill, no cohort years and anything along those lines as you vandalize the data to raise alarms?
Bill Wheeler: That's right.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of John Nadel of Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Steve, I have a question about the recent CCAR results for the large bank financial institutions. I'm just curious whether you and the Board and the rest of management have any real sort of learnings or takeaways from the recent CCAR process. And maybe particularly with the focus on Citigroup's "failure" which appear to be, at least this is my sense driven in part by sort of the global nature of their business. And I'm just sort of wondering, if you're incrementally thinking about implementing any changes or anything incrementally to your enterprise risk management as a result of what you saw?
Steve Kandarian: John, I think you raise a good point, which is we're in uncharted waters here. Dodd-Frank passed in 2010; implementation really is in the very early stages, everyone's learning how to work together both on regulatory side and in this case in the bank side. I think people are going through the learnings of all this. And I think as of now there's not a great deal of transparency in terms of how all these calculations get done on the regulatory side. So I think people are trying to figure out how to operate within that environment. And it's obviously been difficult in some cases and we're mindful of that. And we are certainly building out our capabilities in case we are designated a SIFI on a final basis and regulated by the Federal Reserve. So it is something that we've spent a great deal of time discussing internally at the management level with our Board. And we certainly are taking steps at MetLife to make sure that we are prepared going forward should we'd be finally designated as a SIFI.
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee: Okay. That's helpful. I mean obviously, it was a little surprising, right? And my sense is that management at a couple of these companies in particular Citigroup were also may be taken by surprise in terms of the result. So I know you guys had a little experience with that. The next question is more, it's about Asia. And I was just hoping we could get a little bit better detail on some of the underlying trends that more of the product level maybe first sector in Japan versus third sector, what you like and what you saw on the sales side, what you're sort of unhappy with you. If you can just give us a sense there that would be great.
Chris Townsend: Sure, Tom. It's Chris Townsend here. So the sales for Asia as John mentioned were up 2% year-on-year and they were down 34% sequentially. So if I take that sequential plan of first of all, we wrote a very significant account in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2013 plus there was some high sales of two yen-based life products before they were repriced. It was repriced both of those products, one in October, one in December and then now at or above our return hurdle rate. So what you've seen is following that repricing a significant reduction in terms of the first step, the life sales and because of some of the packaging element which we spoken to you before about there has been a knock on impact in terms of the third sector as well. The persistency overall is good, revenues are up both sequentially and year-on-year. The cancer product is selling very well. We launched a new cancer product last August and we're just about at 100,000 new customers for that product now. And the cancer sales overall are up about 120% year-on-year. Going forward, what you'll see is that we'll tweak slightly to – one of the short pay periods, the life product and also in the second half we'll launch a range of new A&H products and riders as well. So that will lift sales towards the second half of the year. I think Dave (sic) John, the other couple points to mention here is that we've spoken a number of times about the multichannel benefits of our business in Japan. And I would just like to point out that the bank channel sales of return significantly as we've got greater stability in the yen dollar and there's sort of a reduction and the increases in the Nikkei and the Topix. We have seen that bank channel come back very strongly in 100% growth year-on-year. And the final point here is, collectively as you think the repricing of those actions have turned into very positive margin for us and we're up about 300 or 400 basis points quarter-on-quarter.
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee: That's really helpful. And Chris maybe just one more quick one, any expectation, way I guess maybe sort of what's your view reading tea leaves if you will have any chance for in Japan for the government to make some changes incrementally to co-pays? 
Chris Townsend: I don't have a view on that right now.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Erik Bass of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass - Citigroup: Hi. Thank you. First, can you provide an update on your thinking about the equity units? And I know you've been clear certainly that you don't want to do a buyback and then have to issue equity of capital requirements change, but is your view on equity units at all different since you are essentially issuing equity if you don't offset the dilution?
Steve Kandarian: It was our intent when we issued those securities that we'll buy them back in the marketplace and we mentioned that before. And again, the capital considerations that we're analyzing, because of the uncertainty of the rules which are not yet in draft form for us to review has resulted in us to date not buying back those equity units. But certainly philosophically that is something that we had intended to do when we engaged in the Alico transaction back in 2010 and issued those securities.
Erik Bass - Citigroup: Okay. And then it's on the group business, can you comment a little bit more on just to what's driving the strong sales so far in kind of current activity and pricing trends in the market? And I guess the strong sales is like coming more from new accounts or an expanded product offering?
Bill Wheeler: Eric, it's Bill. I would say that the answer is both. Remember, we talked a lot about our strategy of growing our group business, but going down marketing growing at what I would call the middle market. We have a very strong presence in the large company marketplace in the U.S. and going down market with what I would say our broad product offering, which means not only our base coverages, but also all our worksite products. And we're having a lot of success down there. So we have seen increased sales and I would say the middle market as well as strong worksite sales, and that's consistent with I think the strategy that we've laid out here in terms of shift to more protection product. And in terms of just that I would say the tone of pricing, the pricing environment is I would say relatively good. I mean the guys who run that business are always sort of flinch when I say that because they always feel there's somebody out there who has been a little aggressive. But I would say today the pricing environment is relatively attractive and for the worksite portion of the business we think it's quite attractive.
Erik Bass - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you for the color.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Mark Finkelstein of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Mark Finkelstein - Evercore: Hi. Good morning. Actually sort of a follow-up to Erik Bass' question. Steve, in your opening remarks I think you addressed to palm kind of the evolution of the rules and some of the legislative actions. But you also talked about draft rules not coming out until 2015. And in your comments you actually used the words take into consideration the timing of the rules when you think about capital deployment. So the question is, I mean how was the timing influencing or how is your thinking evolving in terms of the timing in terms of those actions?
Steve Kandarian: Hi, Mark. Well, I think you saw it with our dividend announcement. I think that's fairly aggressive increase in the dividend given that we had a large dividend increase one year earlier. And $1.40 a share for dividend for MetLife that translates to 2.7% yield, and roughly a 25% payout ratio. So I think you're seeing we're taking actions now that we think makes sense for us given the delay in the pronouncement of the draft rules of the Fed. And when we first engaged in this analysis and discussion internally two years ago or more, we anticipated that we would have greater clarity by now about capital rules. So as time goes on and cash accumulates in the company, if we're trying to find that right balance between making sure that we have adequate capital imposed rules by the Fed on one hand, if we're finally designated. And on the other hand making sure we're here to our philosophy of returning excess capital to our shareholders. So the dividend increase, I think is reflective of that consideration of the timing being pushed back and further accumulation of cash and again, you saw effectively another capital action back last year in the fall when we acquired ProVida for $2 billion in cash without issuing any shares in that acquisition. So we're trying to again strike that right balance. And certainly in terms of what we're thinking about in the future, we have to really look at all these things from a perspective of both timing, how much cash we're accumulating, merger and acquisition opportunities for us, acquisition opportunities for us and our dividend levels and so on. So everything is really kind of part of a more complex equation that we consider as we look at capital management.
Mark Finkelstein - Evercore: Okay. That's helpful. And then just two very quick business questions. In Asia, you referenced favorable expenses. How much did that positively influence the Asia earnings? And then in EMEA, if you talked about maybe the run rate being lower. How should we think about that as well?
John Hele: Hi. This is John. It's about $10 million for the Asia earnings on the expenses in the quarter as it's really just a matter of timing. I'm sorry but I missed the second part of the question?
Mark Finkelstein - Evercore: A similar comment on EMEA that the run rate was likely should be going forward is a little bit lower? Just trying to frame out how we should think about EMEA earnings?
John Hele: Slightly lower.
Mark Finkelstein - Evercore: Slightly lower. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Giovanni of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs: Thanks so much. Steve, you made the comment about VA where you think you now might be in a position to grow with the better risk product. Is this still with 4% roll-up product? Are you looking to maybe re-risk the product to get back more in line with peers? And then and thinking about kind of the growth year, I think one of the concerns you had with VA was uncertainty over the capital treatment for separate accounts the way the current bank framework is written. So if you're looking to now grow VA again, has this changed? What's changed I guess in terms of your confidence, the bigger VA book won't be an issue in federal oversight?
Steve Kandarian: So Chris let me take the first part of your question regarding the capital treatment of VAs. Then I'll turn it over to Bill for the business discussion about our strategy going forward. Again, the rules are not written so we don't know exactly how the Fed will treat separate accounts. However, I'd say conversations we've been having with them and others in Washington are encouraging from the following perspective. I think they better understand today than they did a couple of years ago, how our business now differs from that of a bank. And I think they understand that the non-guarantee portion of VA is the true separate account component really it's not a risk to MetLife on its balance sheet. And banks don't have this separate account situation on their balance sheet. So there is even if the Collins amendment is not modified, I think an opportunity for the Fed to say bank rules just don't apply in this particular instance about separate accounts. So it is possible it's up to them obviously not me but it's possible for them to look at separate accounts and not assess significant capital charges or significant capital charges for the non-guarantee portion of that business for us. And there's no indication by them one way or the other, but I would simply say the conversations we've had indicate more and better understanding on their part about what the risks really are associated with that part of our balance sheet which is virtually zero, if it's someone else's money that has been accounted for in our balance sheet. So with that I'll turn it over to Bill for the business question.
Bill Wheeler: Chris with regard to VA pricing and competitiveness, I know you know this, but obviously, you've seen a real hardening of that market in terms of product features and investment options and the roll-up rate is an important consideration, but it's really only one living benefit rider there is other things going on. And I think the other thing that's happened of course is, you've seen a lot of sales now much broader diverse group of sales where there is no living benefit rider where the main motivation is tax efficiency or other things. And so our plan going forward is really to pursue all those of avenues, not just oh, we got to have a more aggressive living benefit rider, it's we've got to make sure that we are in all the other kinds of variable annuity products to meet specific customer needs. And so when we talk about our strategy, that's a big piece of it. Now we're always looking at how we can change our living benefit rider and my guess is, we'll modify that as well but there is nothing to talk about at the moment. But that kind of gives you a little color on our thinking here.
Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Those comments helpful. And then just one on ROE, Steve, you made the comment that the group business despite some of this adverse underwriting is still generating good returns. And I know you don't want to get into kind of segmented allocation of capital. But clearly you are focused on growing certain lines of business. So how should we be thinking about the returns on kind of the in-force that you're generating on those kind of core businesses that you guys have? And then what's maybe the drag that you're seeing from those run-off blocks that you've clearly deemphasized around long-term care and SGUL?
Bill Wheeler: Well, I'll give you a little color on that, Chris. Our protection businesses, we're talking mid to high teens ROEs and they have always been that way honestly that's the – even in what I would say a tough underwriting period. And obviously Group is really the leader there and it's quite attractive ROE business. I would say the asset intensive businesses right now especially with the longer-term liability there go a long-term care and where there's been really low interest rates those ROEs are underperforming. And that's our challenge going forward as to – sort of work on the risk profile of those particular products, but at the same time grow the higher ROE business. And I would say obviously another factors in emerging markets ROE there is protracted this way.
Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs: And Bill with those be point drags to ROE or basis point drags to ROE just speaking kind of an aggregate?
Bill Wheeler: You mean, you're asking order of magnitude of the drags?
Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs: Yes. I mean thinking about long-term care in SGUL, I mean clearly they are underperforming but is there kind of reducing aggregate ROEs by a point or are we talking basis points?
Bill Wheeler: Well, the long-term-care block in and of itself isn't that big. So it's relative to the size of MetLife. So I'm sure that would be bps not full basis – full points. But, yes, I would say in general, sure, those bigger – those more asset intensive long guarantee businesses have the impact on the ROEs point.
Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks very much. The underwriting in 2013 was in some quarters quite challenging. And now you have another quarter of it although you have said that really relates to – now being there’s no trend here. That doesn’t necessarily tell you that you, that you got things are okay you might have a broader problem. My question is, when will we, when will you be in a position to sort of sound the all clear sign? If we have another quarter or two more quarters, how many quarters, how many quarters of normal underwriting results do you need before you can conclude that there is no problem? Thanks. That’s my first question.
Bill Wheeler: Yes. Eric, you broke up a little bit, but I think I got the gist of your question which is, group underwriting experience last year was a little soft and now we’ve had a soft quarter in the first quarter of 2014. How long until we feel better about it? There is, if you look back at our history especially in Group Life over time, in the first quarter we often run a mortality ratio of 90% plus, that’s not that uncommon. This was a little worse than that, obviously, and so I would see this, I kind of view the Group Life experience as really kind of a seasonal quarter, but a tough seasonal quarter, tougher than normal. In terms of the future, look, we – our expectation is that our underwriting, especially in Group Life should start, should revert to the mean in the second quarter. And if it doesn’t, that’ll be another data point, which would cause us concern. But that's our – that's why we kind of view this really as a blip, and there are definitely blips in these, in this experience, not a trend. So I – my expectation is, I should see improvement in the second quarter and if I don't I should be worried. And so that's kind of our feeling.
Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets: Very helpful. And, Steve, one follow-up question. On a global basis, it feels like the top line, and by the top line, I don't mean sales, I mean premium fees and other deposits, is growing at about 5% pace excluding the effect of currency. Is that consistent with your expectations? And how do you feel about that level of top line growth? Are you satisfied with that? Or should it be better? Do feel it's appropriate given the markets in which Met is competing, or do you feel it should be better still? Thank you.
Steve Kandarian: Eric, I think it's consistent with what our expectations are. But I also would point you to the my remarks a little bit earlier talking about essentially us pivoting from trying to get the risk profile of right of the company to now focusing on growth going forward. And I think that is – this is the right time for us to really think about those opportunities throughout MetLife's business platform, meaning through geographies, different products, and so on and to press on the issue of growth going forward. So we've spent the last roughly three years trying to make sure that we had a risk profile in the right place, the products designed the way that we felt offered good value to our customers on the one hand, but also a fair return to our shareholders on the other hand, and didn't result in significant fat-tail risk in the future. That was sort of step one of the strategy here, in step two now that we're pivoting to what is, is finding ways to further grow the business.
Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: Thanks. John, can you give us a bit more insight on the sources of the net cost savings in 2015, the $600 million you broadly outlined?
John Hele: Sure. So these costs are really throughout the entire company. We've been focusing on many different aspects and taking out over the last few years layers of management particularly in the U.S. as well as the reorganization we've done in retail in the United States and moving people to Charlotte. In the technology side, we've created a new center in Raleigh-Durham. And so you're starting now to see some of these flowing through, whereas in 2012 and 2013 we had more restructuring charges that were flowing through so the net basis was less. You're starting to see these cost saves flow through the entire company not just in the U.S. but also even in Asia and other areas we're seeing continued cost discipline. I think this is something that is starting to stick in our company and you're starting to see the results in our financials.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: Is there a certain metric we should focus on in terms of trying to track that level of improvement in 2015 and beyond?
John Hele: It's the expense ratio. However, you do need to adjust a little bit if we had some material moves in our mix of business. So for example, in Latin America by the acquisition of ProVida that runs at a higher expense ratio very profitable business but a higher expense ratio. Without a mix change and for the whole company, it takes quite a bit to really shift that. So on a quarter-by-quarter basis you'll see that ratio be a very good measure. But I just caution you to adjust your models for when we do major material changes in the mix different businesses have slightly different expense ratios.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: Okay. Then separate topic, I guess more for Steve and Bill. On variable annuity sales growth, you mentioned the likelihood that you could start growing VA sales growth again now with the new product in place and the new mix and less reliance on living benefits. Should we think about that as a low, mid-single-digit growth opportunity or perhaps something larger?
Bill Wheeler: I think if you think about the overall revenue of the business, yes, I'd say it's, I don't see this being a double-digit grower. Obviously, it somewhat depends on what's going on with the capital markets. But assuming those are benign, I don't expect it to be a double-digit grower.
Jay Gelb – Barclays: Is that starting in 2015 though?
Bill Wheeler: Well, I don't think we're – I think we’re a little ahead of ourselves in terms of kind of giving specific forecasts for 2015 yet. But, I think what we're trying to do is make sure it's clear that we're still committed to the annuity business.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: Makes sense. Thank you.
Ed Spehar: Okay. We're at 9 o’clock. Thank you all for your participation, and have a good day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission included in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Edward A. Spehar: Thank you, Gail, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings press release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year results for 2013. Fourth quarter operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2012; and operating earnings per share were $1.37, a 10% increase over the prior year period. Growth in the per share basis was dampened by the conversion of equity units issued in 2010 to fund the acquisition of Alico. Operating return to equity was 11.5% in the quarter. Full year 2013 operating earnings were $6.3 billion, an 11% increase over 2012; and operating earnings per share, which were also affected by the conversion of equity units, were up 7% from the prior year period. Operating return on equity for the full year 2013 was 12% or at the low end of our 2016 goal of 12% to 14%. Operating earnings benefited from the favorable capital markets environment last year. Equity market performance added 50 basis points to return on equity in 2013 and above planned variable investment income added 40 basis points. In addition to strong variable investment income, recurring investment margins were above our expectations, with the favorable variance equating to 50 basis points on 2013 operating ROE. Together, recurring investment margins and variable investment income explain the resilience of MetLife's investment spreads despite a prolonged period of low interest rates. Recurring investment margins have benefited from effective asset liability management and income from derivatives, many of which were purchased in the mid-2000s to protect earnings under a low interest rate scenario. However, there were also factors that depressed operating ROE in 2013. The combination of weaker-than-anticipated underwriting results, elevated legal costs and some pressure from currency weakness exerted a drag on ROE of almost 100 basis points. While MetLife's results benefited from a favorable capital markets environment in 2013, achieving the low end of our 2016 operating ROE target 3 years early is nevertheless a noteworthy accomplishment. MetLife's financial performance last year highlighted the strength of our diversified business model. In addition, I believe the quality of MetLife's operating return on equity has improved because the upward trend in ROE has been accompanied by a decline in balance sheet leverage. Operating return on equity increased from 9.8% in 2010 to 12% in 2013, while the ratio of common equity to assets increased from 8.1% at year end 2010 to 9.9% at year end 2013. This ratio, which excludes separate account assets and the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income, is one way to look at leverage. We believe it is appropriate to exclude separate accounts from the leverage calculation because the investment risks and rewards of these assets are borne by the contract holders. To the extent there is a guarantee in these contracts, the associated reserves are held outside of the separate accounts. These reserves and the related capital are included in the leverage ratio calculation. We have taken a cautious approach to balance sheet leverage because of uncertainties surrounding potential capital requirements, if MetLife is designated a nonbank systemically important financial institution or SIFI. In particular, we are concerned about the risk of bank-centric capital rules. MetLife remains under Stage 3 review by the Financial Stability Oversight Council for potential designation as a SIFI, and the timing of the decision from FSOC remains unknown. We believe the evidence clearly demonstrates that we do not pose a threat to the financial system of the United States. At the same time, we continue to make the case that, if designated, applying bank-centric capital rules to the business of insurance would constrain our ability to issue guarantees and increase the cost of financial protection for consumers. Turning to our strategy. We made significant progress in 2013 on our efforts to shift MetLife's business mix away from capital-intensive, market-sensitive products to our protection-oriented products. Our full year 2013 variable annuity sales of $10.6 billion were down 40% and were consistent with the $10 billion to $11 billion target we provided in December of 2012. In contrast, emerging market sales, which consist predominantly of protection-oriented products, rose 28% in our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment and 18% in Latin America. 2013 was also a good year for our strategy to grow emerging markets. In addition to a significant increase in sales, we expanded our geographic footprint through partnerships and acquisitions in Asia and Latin America. In December, we reached a deal to acquire a stake in the insurance business of AMMB, Malaysia's fifth largest bank. The deal complements agreements reached earlier in the year to enter fast-growing markets in Vietnam and Myanmar. In Latin America, we successfully completed our acquisition of Provida, the largest pension plan administrator in Chile. The earnings contribution in the quarter from Provida, which closed on October 1, was in line with our plan, and our outlook for earnings remains $190 million to $210 million for 2014. The acquisition of Provida is a great example of what we believe is a prudent approach to capital management given the uncertain regulatory environment. We used cash to acquire a fee-based business with limited market sensitivity and strong free cash flow. We priced the acquisition to create value based on our stock price in the high-30s, so the assumed cost of capital was higher than it is today. I also want to provide a framework for how we think about share buybacks versus dividends during this period of regulatory uncertainty. We are not repurchasing shares at this time because we want to avoid the potential need to issue equity if there is an adverse regulatory outcome. With regard to the dividend, however, an increase typically represents a much smaller dollar commitment than a share buyback. For example, even though we increased our dividend almost 50% last year, a sizeable move because we have not raised the dividend since 2007, the incremental annual capital outlay was only $400 million. It is our practice to review MetLife's dividend policy with the Board of Directors annually. Finally, I want to comment on recent concerns about volatility in emerging markets and the potential impact on MetLife's earnings. Recent turmoil in certain emerging markets does not change our view of the long-term attractiveness of our emerging markets business. Nothing has changed regarding the key macro drivers of middle-class growth and low levels of insurance penetration. Also, we believe that reforms instituted since the crises of 1990s should lead to less volatile economic cycles in emerging markets. These reforms include floating currencies, more independent central banks and better banking regulation. In addition, we believe emerging market sovereign debt is less risky today as a result of reduced external ownership, more longer-dated maturities and less reliance on foreign currency denominated funding. Volatility in emerging markets could mean more currency translation risks in the near term, but we expect the immaterial earnings impact relative to our plan for 2014. Our exposure to a diversified basket of currencies explains a limited risk from recent moves in exchange rates. For example, the largest currency exposure in EMEA is the euro, which has strengthened modestly relative to the U.S. dollar for the year-to-date. As I said in the third quarter earnings call, we know we must accept risk to earn an appropriate return for our shareholders, but determining the type of risk is a critical management decision. On balance, we believe the emerging market risk is acceptable for MetLife because it is diversifiable and the products sold in these markets generally have more favorable risk return profiles and growth outlooks than those sold in developed markets. In closing, let me reiterate that 2013 was a strong year for MetLife. Full year operating earnings were up 11%, which followed the increase of 22% in 2012. Operating ROE improved from 9.8% to 12% over this 2-year period. While regulatory uncertainty remains a challenge, we feel very good about our fundamental business prospects. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele, to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. As Steve noted, MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.6 billion, up 14% year-over-year; and operating earnings per share of $1.37, up 10% year-over-year. This quarter included a few notable items: First, pretax variable investment income was $460 million, reflecting strong private equity and hedge fund returns, as well as higher mortgage and bond prepayments. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $296 million, which was $101 million or $0.09 per share above the top end of our 2013 quarterly guidance range. The second item relates to the strengthening of our asbestos litigation reserves, which reduced operating earnings in Corporate & Other by $101 million or $0.09 per share. As noted on the December outlook call, we have asbestos litigation reserves as a result of claims related to certain research and other activities by MetLife from the 1920s to the 1950s. As the frequency of severe claims related to asbestos has not declined as expected, additional reserves were required. The third notable item relates to an increase in other litigation-related reserves, which reduced operating earnings in the Americas by $46 million or $0.04 per share. The final notable item -- items were in our P&C business and EMEA. In our P&C business, we had a $15 million benefit from favorable prior year reserve development and lower-than-budgeted cat losses, while EMEA had an $11 million benefit from tax-related items. In total, these 2 items increased operating earnings by $26 million or $0.02 per share. Turning to our bottom line results. Fourth quarter net income was $877 million or $0.77 per share and included net derivative losses of $242 million after tax. The net derivative losses in the quarter were driven primarily by 3 items that we consider to be either noneconomic or a cause of asymmetrical accounting treatment: number one, an increase in interest rates; number two, changes in foreign currencies, principally the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the yen; and number three, the MetLife own credit impact associated with our VA program. Changes in interest rates in the quarter contributed slightly to more than 50% of the net derivative losses, while foreign currency in MetLife's own credit impact combined for most of the remaining balance. The combination of these derivative losses and other asymmetrical accounting impacts explains most of the difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $48.49 at December 31, up 1% from $47.99 at September 30. Turning to fourth quarter margins. Underwriting in the U.S. improved on a year-over-year basis but was less favorable than planned. The mortality ratio in group life was 87.9%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 84.6%, which included a benefit of 2.7 points from 2 nonrecurring reserve refinements. The ratio this quarter was within the target range of 85% to 90%. The mortality ratio in Retail Life was 74.8%, better than our expectation and the 99% ratio in the fourth quarter 2012, which experienced a number of high face amount claims. The mortality ratio this quarter reflects favorable direct mortality results and the benefit of nonrecurring items. However, mortality earnings were not as strong as the direct mortality ratio would suggest because the favorable experience was concentrated in claims that were more heavily reinsured. The nonmedical health benefit ratio was 90.8% favorable to the prior year quarter of 91.6%, but worse than our plan and just above the top end of the target range of 86% to 90%. The shortfall versus planned was caused by an increase in utilization in dental and lower-than-expected offsets in our open block of long-term disability claims. Disability incidents and closure rates were within expectations. In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 88.6% for retail and 97 -- 93.7% for group. Year-over-year results were slightly better in both Retail and group versus the prior year quarter, which was adversely impacted by Superstorm Sandy. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 85.2% in Retail and 92.9% in group. Moving to fourth quarter investment margins. The simple average of the 4 U.S. product spreads and our quarterly financial supplement was 241 basis points, including variable investment income; and 199 basis points, excluding VII. This result showed only a modest decline versus the prior year quarter of 246 basis points, including VII; and 206 basis points excluding VII. The story is generally the same on a full year basis. As Steve mentioned, the resiliency of our investment spreads is attributable to effective asset liability management, good variable investment income and income from derivatives. With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 25.4% in the fourth quarter as compared to 22.4% in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for the onetime asbestos and other litigation-related expenses, the normalized operating expense ratio was 23.7%, in line with our expectations but still slightly higher than the prior year quarter. There were several factors that contributed to the higher ratio this quarter, including opportunistic reinvestment in the business such as higher advertising and IT projects. In addition, costs associated with new business such as Provida and U.S. Sponsored Direct, as well as the impact of lower closeouts, higher pension expenses and timing of certain items contributed as well. For the full year of 2013, the operating expense ratio was 24.3% versus 23.8% for 2012. Excluding the negative impact from the asbestos and other litigation-related items, the expense ratio would have been 23.8%, equal to the prior year and slightly better than our full year plan. For 2013, gross expense saves were $571 million, which is consistent with the target we discussed on our December outlook call. Net saves were $332 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $56 million and onetime cost of $183 million. Overall, we are pleased with our expense performance as we remain on track to deliver gross saves of $770 million to $800 million in 2014 and $1 billion in 2015 and net saves of $600 million in 2015. I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $658 million, up 4% versus the prior year quarter and up 15% when adjusting for notable items in both periods, including net positive DAC unlocking and higher catastrophes in the prior year quarter. Life and other reported operating earnings of $285 million, up 67% year-over-year and 17% when adjusting for notable items in both periods, including higher catastrophes of $37 million after tax in the prior year quarter. The primary drivers were more favorable underwriting, higher net investment income and lower DAC amortization. Annuities reported operating earnings of $373 million, down 19% versus the prior year quarter. Adjusting for a positive DAC unlocking of $133 million in the prior year quarter and other notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 13%. The drivers included higher fees from separate account growth, resulting from strong investment performance and lower DAC amortization. The initial market impact was favorable to operating earnings by $32 million after tax, which was $11 million higher than the prior year quarter. Variable annuities sales were $1.7 billion in the quarter, down 53% year-over-year and 38% sequentially. As Steve mentioned, full year VA sales were $10.6 billion and within our planned range of $10 billion to $11 billion. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $231 million, up 38% year-over-year and essentially flat when adjusting for notable items in both periods. The prior year quarter included favorable reserve releases, higher catastrophes and intangible write down. The primary drivers in the fourth quarter of 2013 were higher net investment income offset by higher expenses, primarily due to pension and postretirement benefits. Underwriting results were essentially flat year-over-year, with an improvement in long-term care offsetting less favorable performance in group, life and dental. Corporate benefit funding reported operating earnings of $358 million, up 17% year-over-year and 25% when adjusting for access variable investment income in both periods and a legal reserve increase in the current quarter. The year-over-year growth was due to favorable investment margins, primarily driven by Capital Market investment products. Latin America reported operating earnings of $173 million, up 17% year-over-year and 22% on a constant currency basis. These results reflect the 2013 Provida acquisition, which was in line with expectations and improved underwriting in Mexico, partially offset by higher expenses due to business initiatives, inflation adjustments and volume-related growth. Premium fees and other revenues were up 28% year-over-year, 34% on a constant currency basis and 23% excluding Provida. The strong growth across the region was primarily due to worksite marketing in Mexico and growth in our agency and group business in Chile. Sales growth was also strong in the region, up 27% driven by Mexican group and worksite marketing, as well as growth in the agency sales force and direct marketing in Chile. Turning now to Asia. Operating earnings were $324 million, up 64% year-over-year and 74% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, which included negative DAC unlocking in the prior year quarter in Japan and Korea and excess variable investment income in the current quarter, operating earnings were up 19%, reflecting higher investment income and business growth. Premium fees and other revenues were down 8% year-over-year, but up 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Japan, Korea and Australia. Sales were up 44%, primarily driven by a large group case in Australia, as well as higher life sales in Japan. In Japan, we experienced higher-than-planned sales in the fourth quarter in advance of pricing changes on 2 of our yen-denominated life products. These products were not achieving our targeted return as a result of low interest rates in Japan and mandated regulatory reserve changes. Adjusting for the Australia group sales, which can be lumpy, and the higher-than-planned sales in Japan, Asia sales would have been essentially flat year-over-year. Finally, in EMEA, operating earnings were $89 million, up 51% year-over-year and 48% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for favorable tax items in the quarter, operating earnings were up 32%, driven by business growth across the region. Premium fees and other revenues were up 3% year-over-year and 2% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Russia, Poland, the U.K., the Gulf and Turkey. There are items in both periods depressing year-over-year growth. Adjusting for these items, underlying growth was 8% and consistent with the near-term guidance we provided during the December 2013 outlook call. Sales declined 1%, driven by regulatory developments in the U.K., which we discussed on the second quarter 2013 earnings call. Sales from emerging markets increased 21% due to growth in the Middle East, Russia and Poland. Now I will discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets of the holding companies were approximately $5.9 billion at end of the fourth quarter, which is at the top end of the range that we provided at our May Investor Day after adjusting for the benefit from $1 billion of senior debt issued to prefund 2014 maturities. In addition, our 23 -- our 2013 free cash flow ratio was 36%. Turning to our capital position. While we have not completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2013, we estimate our combined RBC ratio will be in the 440% or 460% range. Our Japan solvency margin ratio, which we file quarterly, was 945% as of the third quarter, and we estimate that our fourth quarter ratio will be above 900%. For our domestic insurance companies in the fourth quarter, preliminary U.S. statutory results are operating earnings of approximately $900 million and net income of approximately $800 million. For the full year of 2013, U.S. statutory earnings were approximately $3 billion, and U.S. statutory net income was approximately $2 billion. U.S. statutory operating earnings were down $1.4 billion as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher taxes, reserve strengthening on our long-term care business in New York due to mandated lower investment return assumptions and increased legal reserves. Our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital is expected to be approximately $26 billion as of December 31, 2013, down 9% compared to the prior year as dividends for the holding company and unrealized losses and derivatives more than offset statutory net income. In conclusion, MetLife had a good fourth quarter, completing a strong 2013. Our margins remain healthy, and we continue to focus on generating profitable growth. The financial results MetLife delivered in 2013 demonstrate the strength of the franchise, the benefit of diversification and the ongoing successful execution of our strategy. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Crédit Suisse.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: First question, just on group benefits, I guess, for Bill or John. Can you comment on the increase in claims on dental and disability? On the dental side, I hear what you said on -- just higher claims being submitted. In disability, it sounds like it's more lack of social security offsets. Do you think those issues stay with you for a bit here, or is there some reason to think those are going to lessen over the near term?
William J. Wheeler: Tom, it's Bill. So we'll take them one at a time. With regard to dental, yes, dental claims experienced was a little higher than we would normally predict. And the reason for that is we saw higher dental usage at the lower end of the market with small employers. And we -- I guess our theory about that is that it's likely due to employees who are worried about losing their dental coverage because their companies will either change their benefits because of the Affordable Care Act or something is likely to happen. And so I think they felt, while they still had their dental coverage, they'd go get some work done. The -- we do see this kind of behavior from time to time. And I guess, while there's no assurance that it'll abate in 2014, our expectation is it probably will a little bit. You do generally see higher utilization at the end of the year anyway for kind of the same reasons. So -- and that, by and large, was not the biggest driver of the ratio. With regard to disability, let's be clear. So the block, in my mind, actually performed quite well. And by that, I mean incidents rates were good, severity was good, claim closure rates were fine and reopens of closed cases were also fine. So all that was sort of in tolerance, if you will. What the -- but the significant difference was our, as you alluded to, our social security offsets were quite low. And they're always low in the fourth quarter, but they were extremely low this time. And we -- obviously, we've listened to some of our competitors in terms of what they've talked about in the quarter. A few of them have mentioned the same -- having the same experience. We know some others have as well. So I don't -- the question is, is this systemic, or is this sort of a kind of a blip? Because occasionally, the Social Security Administration does have a blip in terms of its claim approval rates. And our feeling is that this is just an unusual quarter and not indicative of what's likely to happen next year. And I guess, I also think that therefore, the kind of recovery and underwriting that we've been predicting for 2014, I think that story is still intact.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So no backing away from the guidance you put out back in December about what you expect from group?
William J. Wheeler: No. You know, look, we're obviously a little wary, but no. We aren't backing away from that guidance.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just -- if I could shift to Chris Townsend, just a question on Asia and Japan in particular. Can you comment a bit about what's going on behind the scenes between first sector and third sector sales there? I believe you guys have a push of a new cancer product. It sounds like sales are flattish right now in that market. Is that still the expectation there?
Christopher G. Townsend: The cancer products we launched in the third quarter of the year is going very well for us. The sales in November, we sold about 20,000 products. And the good thing is that we are not cannibalizing any of the rest of our business. So as you well know, we make a good amount of our operating earnings in Japan out of the third sector products. Overall sales were relatively flat quarter-on-quarter, but for the fourth quarter, we believe that, throughout 2014, the sort of numbers we're looking at probably are low- to mid-single-digit growth for the third sector, which is probably in excess of the market growth we'd expect there.
Operator: We'll go to the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Steve, a question for you. At your opening commentary, you focused a bit on leverage there and why we should maybe be looking at leverage excluding separate accounts. While I think most of us on this call and most of us that have been following you in the industry certainly agree with that. I guess, the question I'd pose is do you think you're gaining some traction with the regulators in Washington around this issue?
Steven A. Kandarian: John, I think it's still early days to make any predictions on what comes out of Washington. First, we have not been designated at this point in time, we're still in Phase III. And as of now, there are no drafts outstanding regarding what the rules will look like. So that's why we're remaining cautious at this point in terms of our leverage. And as we mentioned in the call today, that not only did we achieve a 12% ROE, but we are less leveraged today than we were several years ago. So both earnings are up as well as the quality of earnings in our judgment.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. Turning to the international operations. I just wanted to think about tax rates here just a little bit. And I know your overall guidance for 2014 -- I believe, if I recall correctly, it's a 27.5% effective rate on a consolidated basis. Should we think about the tax rates that we saw in 2013, even adjusting for the $11 million item in EMEA, as a reasonable run rate for the international operations, Asia, LatAm, and EMEA, respectively? Because even if I adjust for that EMEA tax item this quarter, it looks like the rates outside the U.S. were pretty low. Can you help there?
John C. R. Hele: This is John, John. I would caution you, the consolidated is correct on our business. And, of course, it's 35% in the U.S. and essentially 35% in Japan, but EMEA has had some lumps this year due to APB elections and it's had some gains throughout the year. So they're going to be in the mid-20s, I believe, is the sort of combined EMEA tax rate for the year.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then is there any -- LatAm looks -- Latin America looked pretty low this quarter as well. Is there anything there that was really driven by Provida? Or just some onetime items and we ought to think about the tax rate as being higher going forward there as well?
John C. R. Hele: So it's the same story. We've had some lumpy gains here and there. You know how taxes work, so you have to average it out over the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Actually, I want to go back to the leverage question. And Steve, you articulated how you've taken down leverage. I think you gave ratios of 8.1% to 9.9%. And what I'm curious about is, do you have an objective of where you'd like to get that ratio to? And what I mean is, on the one hand, you're talking about more opportunities, say in the pension closeout market which add leverage maybe a little bit on the non-VA annuity side, but you're also looking to -- you've also taken down the leverage ratio. So how do those 2 balance? And what are your objectives going forward?
Steven A. Kandarian: Mark, we don't have a specific number as a target going forward. We just think that, overall, it made sense for us to take the actions we've taken and not take certain actions that we may have taken absent the Dodd-Frank consideration. So by now, we would've engaged in share buybacks most likely. But given the uncertainty, we've held back and, obviously, that's added to our balance sheet, and it has resulted in less leverage for the company at this point in time. So I don't want to put any specific numbers out as a target because it is a fluid situation and is very dependent upon the environment in which we're operating from a regulatory perspective.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And maybe just on the pension closeouts. I think, on the outlook call, you talked about a study by Towers Watson talking about 40% of sponsors looking to divest of plans under $1 billion or -- I can't recall the exact number. But there's obviously a time line in getting these things done. Are you seeing more opportunities, more activity? And what is the pipeline looking like in that area?
William J. Wheeler: Mark, it's Bill. So the general answer to your question is yes, we see a kind of momentum building in this sector, and there is sort of a couple of ways to think about momentum. You know there are the big jumbo deals that come very sporadically. And I don't think the industry right now sees any big jumbo deals that are out there ready to get bid on anytime soon, but we don't have, obviously, complete transparency into the next 12 months or so. In terms of what I would call the more normal flow business, clearly, momentum is building. Clearly, the pipeline is growing. We did, I think, $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion in pension closeouts in 2013. By the way, that made us the market share leader in 2013. So obviously, no jumbo deals in -- last year. But there's still a nice flow business that we can bid for with good returns. We do see this as an area of growth and I think in the U.S., and I think that's going to continue for quite some time.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just finally, John, cash at the holding company, I don't recall that being mentioned at year end.
John C. R. Hele: Yes. So I mentioned $5.9 billion, which is in the high end of our range. We prefunded -- we issued some debt to prefund a redemption, a maturity coming due in 2014. So the guidance we had given before was at the high end of the range of $4.9 billion. So we're essentially, on a net position, right at our high end of our range.
Operator: Next question will come from Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners.
Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC: Just first, a quick follow-up on the holding company liquidity. Is the target still about $1 billion at this point or has that changed over the last year or so?
John C. R. Hele: I'm sorry. I couldn't hear what you said at the very end of your question.
Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC: Is the holding company liquidity target still $1 billion or has that changed in the last year?
John C. R. Hele: We haven't given precise numbers on that recently. With the uncertainty with the regulatory framework and everything else out there, we are just reporting how much cash we have at the holding company. We're happy with the amount of cash we have at the holding company, but that's all the guidance that we feel comfortable right now. Just the rules are so uncertain, we don't know what's going to happen with federal regulation, the whole potential of that. So for now, until we have certainty on regulatory frameworks, we're just going to report the cash we have.
Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC: Okay, understood. And then a question on annuity earnings. I think if I adjust for the items, as well as the equity market lift, it was about $328 million or so normalized, which was down a bit from more like $350 million in the last couple of quarters. Can you just comment on the driver of that? And should we view the 4Q earnings as a better run rate looking forward?
William J. Wheeler: Ryan, it's Bill Wheeler. So with regard to earning -- annuity earnings, I think, and I -- somebody really pressed me on the -- on our fourth quarter guidance call that we did last December. And I think we said, look, the earnings rate in the third quarter is pretty consistent with what we see at the outlook given sort of moderate stock market growth over the next year. So I -- and obviously, in the fourth quarter, performance was very consistent with that. A couple of things you always got to keep in mind: one is we had DAC -- we had positive DAC unlockings both in the sequential comparison periods as well as the year ago period, and that kind of obviously makes the numbers a little hard to compare. Secondly, remember now that half -- almost half of our separate accounts in the variable annuity business are not in equities anymore. It's a much more diversified asset mix with a lot of fixed income. So the S&P 500 is not going to be the only driver of variable annuity earnings performance. It's much more conservative than it used to be. And so I think that gives you a little feel for what's going on in the annuity business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with UBS.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I wanted to talk about spreads, particularly in the Corporate Benefit Funding business. I think, in your prepared comments, you had mentioned that they were strong both including and excluding variable investment income. So I just was wondering what the underlying drivers are, and if there's any change to your thought process in terms of what that might look like going forward versus the outlook conference call.
William J. Wheeler: Okay, I guess, I'll take that one. The -- so with regard to Corporate Benefit Funding spread, yes, they were strong. Yes, it was driven by both strong variable investment income, but honestly, the underlying investment performance is strong as well. The strong variable investment income, and maybe my colleague Steve Goulart will comment as well, is really -- obviously, hedge funds performed very well in the quarter. We also had very strong mortgage loan prepays experience. And so -- and I guess when you think about our outlook for the next year, we -- so we had -- I guess I'd say we had quite a good beat with regard to variable investment income in the quarter. We don't have -- the reason we call that out is we don't necessarily think it's sustainable. It's not in our base projection. And with that, maybe I'll let Steve talk a little bit about the outlook.
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: Sure. Thanks, Bill. We do have a solid outlook. I think we talked a little bit on the earnings guidance call about our plan for 2014. We've said that we expect $900 million to $1.3 billion in VII for next year or $225 million to $325 million a quarter. Obviously, the fourth quarter was very strong, Bill went through some of the highlights. Nearly every component of VII outperformed our expectations and plan in the fourth quarter. Both sets of alternatives hedge funds and private equity as well has very strong prepayments. Looking forward to the first quarter, though, we don't expect to see that same sort of performance, but we're still very confident about our plan and our outlook for the first quarter and for all of 2014 as well. Remember, there's a lag in private equity and obviously, there's a strong fourth quarter in the equity markets. I think that will help us through the first quarter. But again, I think we're very confident of being within our plan for VII for '14.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. I -- and then maybe for John. Can you remind us about how we should think about the glide path for the interest rate derivative sort of roll-off? I know we talked about this a couple of years ago, but I don't know if we've gotten an update in a while.
John C. R. Hele: We haven't -- it really hasn't changed much. It's quite long. It's -- we've had small amounts. It's been quite small actually impacting us so far up until -- including 2013. And as we hit 2015, in the next 5 years or after, it starts to slowly glide down over the 2020, unless Steve wants to add more to that? That's -- yes. And I just wanted to add on Corporate Benefit Funding. The -- also, I mentioned in my comments about -- it was helped also by Capital Market investment products, both [indiscernible] and some other products. We've been able to fund it at cheaper rates because they're short in [ph] the curves and there's been solid demand for products, so that's helped our earnings on a year-over-year basis.
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: It's Steve Goulart again. Let me just add a little bit on the derivatives piece that John just commented on. I guess -- the thing I'd point out, I think there have been some questions, "Gee, we're in a rising rate environment now. But yet, you're still having strong derivatives income. What's going on?" The thing to remember about this is this is all part of our asset liability management process, and it's a dynamic process. So we're always looking at what are the needs within our portfolios, what are the market opportunities that are available to us, and so the program is actively managed. Just keep that in mind.
John C. R. Hele: Thanks.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes, got it. And then maybe on the same topic. Can you talk about your new money investment rate in the quarter, and maybe how that compares to sort of the overall portfolio yield on a book basis and also, the yield on maturing securities?
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: Let me start with that. Again, I think our new money yield was kind of in line with the market. I think $329 million is what we've said in that order. And, of course, our portfolio continues to run off with higher yielding securities. So there's probably, call it, 100 to 150 basis points difference between new money yield and what's rolling off in the portfolio. But that's sort of as we would expect. Again, we make -- we've made up for a lot of it. And when you look at our portfolio yield being sort of flatter or even up quarter-to-quarter, a lot of that was due to the VII performance that we saw in the fourth quarter. So the yield roll-off is as we expect, and we're making up for it so far in different pieces like VII.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Schuman with KBW.
Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I just want to ask a couple of top line questions. I think there was a large group sale in Australia. I was wondering how much that was, and wondering how we should sort of think about that in the context of a lot of difficult challenges in the Australian group market. In particular, I'm wondering if this was deeper annuation related.
Christopher G. Townsend: Yes, let me take that question. It's Chris Townsend here. The -- there was one single account which was a little over $200 million, and it's a mixture of both life and total permanent disability. And the mix is about 60/40 in favor of TPD in terms of the mix of risk we take. And I guess your question is in relation to the reserve that we took in the third quarter. So we -- there's been a fair amount of dislocation in the market in terms of competitors coming in and going from the market and a fair amount of change in the reinsurance market as well. And I can assure you that we're very careful in terms of pricing to make sure we meet the appropriate hurdles, and we have a number of sets of eyes on every significant risk we write there. So it's our country team in Australia, it's our regional team based out of Hong Kong, and it's Maria Morris's team at Employee Benefits that assist us globally as well. So there are a number of people looking at it to make sure we're getting the appropriate return on our capital in terms of the pricing we're deploying.
Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I mean, is it safe for us to assume that the pricing is much differently than it would have been before developments over the last year or so?
Christopher G. Townsend: That would be a safe assumption, that there's a significant increase in that particular account.
Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: All right. Then in Group and Voluntary, I think PFO growth was 1%. I think the outlook for 2014 was mid-single digit, so a bit of a spread there. I'm just wondering how you feel about sort of accelerating that into 2014 and whether it's dependent on some economic assumptions that we should be sensitive to.
William J. Wheeler: Jeff, it's Bill. The -- keep in mind that a lot of our -- certainly, at the large end of the market, a lot of our sales are already done, right? So we have a pretty good feel for therefore, what will flow through on the income statement. And what we've seen is there's a kind of increasing momentum in group now for a couple of years. A couple of years ago, I think our group revenues actually shrunk. And so you're seeing a much more benign regulatory environment -- or competitive environment, not regulatory, competitive environment. And that means that pricing is more attractive, and we're getting a fair amount of that business. So that's already a little bit in the can already. The second thing that's driving the revenue growth is really our Voluntary Benefits & Worksite strategy. And that is -- we have some pretty aggressive goals there. I would say, in 2013, we did a very good job of hitting those goals. Maybe the best example of what's going on is in auto insurance. We are the largest provider of auto and homeowners at the Worksite. And our revenue growth there was over 5% last year, and we actually expect that to grow faster this year. So -- and that's -- for a pretty mature market -- the auto market hardly grows at all -- that's quite strong performance. So there -- so I would say a lot of the growth, we already kind of know. And -- but obviously, at the Voluntary Worksite part of it, we have some ambitious goals but good momentum.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So first, a question for Steve. You mentioned not wanting to buy back stock and then have to issue equity at SIFI standards that have [ph] 2 owners. But your stock was trading below book value for an extended period, also, relatively attractive now in valuation. So buying back earlier and issuing later wouldn't really be so bad. So just trying to get a sense of how long will you continue to accumulate capital if there's no visibility on SIFI standards this year. Would you, at some point, if you don't find any deals, decide to reevaluate your decision or not? And then, secondly, on pension closeouts, you signed the ASCO noble pension closeout deal this quarter, but maybe, Bill, if you could talk about -- you spoke about the pipeline, but maybe talk about what type of returns you're getting in this market, what the competitive environment is, have you seen other companies sort of pursue this business more aggressively. And then, lastly, on the annuity business, you're obviously pulling back from variable annuities. Fixed annuity sales are still modest, but they more than doubled from the previous quarter. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of this was indexed annuities and what your goals are for the traditional fixed and the fixed-index annuity business over the next few years.
Steven A. Kandarian: So I'll start, Jimmy. As to capital management, it is fluid. We are observing what's going on in the regulatory environment. We did, as you know, raise our dividend by nearly 50% last year. I did mention that we looked at the dividend on an annual basis. I have nothing to report, obviously. I have to talk to my board before announcing anything on that front. We did spend $2 billion in cash on Provida a few quarters ago, so we are I think managing capital within the context of the environment in which we're operating today from a regulatory perspective. And I think you'll see us continue taking actions that make sense in the coming quarters and years as this regulatory environment unfolds. And it's taking a while, obviously, for things to unfold around Dodd-Frank, and we have to be sensitive to what potentially can come out in terms of rules. And right now, there is just very little visibility. We've had comments coming out of people from the Fed, in hearings on Capitol Hill, saying they would like to tailor the rules to be appropriate for the insurance industry, but they followed that up with comments about the Collins Amendment, so-called Section 171 of Dodd-Frank. It ties our hands to some degree in terms of how much they can tailor those rules. That just leaves a lot of uncertainty in terms of how much capital is going to be required of us if we are designated a SIFI and if any appeals we take aren't successful. So I think we have to be prudent here. We have to do what makes sense for the company, not just in the long term, but we have to look at the near term here as well. And we don't want to be in a position where we buy back shares and then end up reissuing equity down the road. We think that would be a bad outcome.
William J. Wheeler: It's Bill again. So let's see if I get all your questions answered. So with regard to pension closeouts, yes, we did a pretty large transaction in the fourth quarter, a little under $700 million of deposits. So that was a big deal. However, just keep in mind, when you think about revenue growth rates and stuff, that in the year ago period, we did a $1 billion pension conversion, which flowed through as revenue on our GAAP income statement. And so even there -- even though we did a big one this quarter, it's-- revenue from pension closeouts actually still look like it was down year-over-year. With regard to returns, the block -- and I don't like to give or -- the block is actually performing very well. I don't like to give ROIs on new sales, obviously, because that's a competitive issue, but we think they're attractive and above our cost of capital, though, I would say at the smaller end of pension closeout market, it's much more competitive, I think, than it would be necessarily for jumbo deals. There's a half a dozen or so players who compete for this business, and I'm not sure if pricing is getting more aggressive or not. I would say it's pretty stable, but it's a pretty competitive, efficient market. And with regard to kind of the fixed annuities end of the business, a couple of things are going on there. One is we've repriced our SPIAs, our retail SPIAs, in that we had increased sales there. Remember the way a SPIA works is the whole deposit comes through as GAAP revenue. And so that sort of accentuates how much that impacts our income statement that you could see it in the sales numbers. So SPIA sales were better. We expect that to continue, frankly. We've also -- we have introduced an indexed annuity product earlier this year called Shield. Shield sales so far this year are, I would say, a little weaker than we would have liked. We've -- it has been a little slow getting approval for Shield in a number of big states, but we're building momentum every quarter there, and I think Shield will end up being a fairly big seller for us in 2014. So the strategy here is to continue to diversify our product portfolio. It isn't just about a guaranteed income benefit writer all the time. It's -- we want to make sure we meet a variety of client needs with regard to annuities and tax deferral and investment performance.
Steven A. Kandarian: Okay. Thank you very much. We're at 9:00, and we'll talk you soon. Thank you.
Operator: Well, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T TeleConference service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the MetLife's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's obligations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Edward A. Spehar: Thank you, Marla, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings press release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another good quarter. Third quarter 2013 operating earnings were $1.5 billion, up 6% over the third quarter of 2012, and operating earnings per share were $1.34, a 2% increase over the prior year period. Growth on a per-share basis was dampened by the conversion of equity units issued in 2010 to fund the acquisition of ALICO. Operating return on equity was 11.4% in the quarter. Operating earnings exceeded our plan but were down from the level reported in the second quarter. As anticipated, certain favorable developments highlighted in the second quarter did not repeat in the third quarter. For example, we said on the second quarter earnings call that variable investment income was expected to decline in the third quarter. Pretax variable investment income was $236 million in the third quarter versus $312 million in the second quarter, a reduction in operating earnings of $0.04 per share. Despite this decline, investment margins were favorable again this quarter. The average investment spread across all U.S. product lines was 221 basis points, which is in the middle of the approximately 200- to 250-basis-point range on the past few years. MetLife's investment spreads have been resilient despite a prolonged period of low interest rates. This performance has resulted from an effective asset liability management, good variable investment income and income from derivatives, many of which were purchased in the mid-2000s to protect earnings under a low-interest-rate scenario. Our strategy to right size the variable annuity business and grow emerging markets was evident in the third quarter results. Variable annuity sales were down 41% from the prior year period, while emerging market sales rose 21% in our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment and 4% in Latin America. Growth in Latin America was below trend as a result of a large case sale in the prior year period. Excluding this large case, sales growth would have been 11%. In addition to higher sales from existing businesses, our grow emerging market strategy will benefit from 3 recent developments. The first, our acquisition of AFP Provida in Chile, will have an immediate positive impact on earnings. The other 2, a start-up operation in Vietnam and a representative office in Myanmar, are consistent with our long-term strategy to expand MetLife's footprint in Southeast Asia. We closed on the acquisition of Provida, the largest pension provider in Chile, on October 1. Our accretion estimate is roughly $0.15 per share in 2014, consistent with the outlook we provided when the deal was announced in February. Accretion in 2013 will be less than anticipated because the deal closed 2 months later than we had assumed. As a result of this transaction, MetLife's earnings from emerging markets are expected to increase from 14% of total company earnings to 17%, putting us well on the way to our 2016 goal of 20%. In late September, we signed an agreement with the Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam, or BIDV, to establish a life insurance joint venture in Vietnam. This joint venture with Vietnam's third-largest bank includes an exclusive bancassurance distribution agreement to sell MetLife products through BIDV's 120 branches and 500 transaction offices. In addition, on October 7, we received approval from the regulatory authority in Myanmar to establish a representative office in the country. While these developments in Southeast Asia are immaterial for earnings in the near term, we are excited about the long-term potential in these fast-growing Southeast Asian markets. Let me now turn to a discussion of risk and return. Without upward moves in equity markets and interest rates, we have been asked recently if better return prospects and variable annuities increase our appetite for this business. Given this question, it is timely to provide perspective on how we think about risk and return overall at MetLife. We know we must accept risk to earn an appropriate return for our shareholders, but determining the type of risk is a critical management decision. Relative to a few years ago, we have been actively diversifying MetLife's risk profile. Our strategy to grow emerging markets and shift the sales mix away from market-sensitive products to protection-oriented products should translate to a more balance risk profile. Less concentration of risk and reduction in so-called fat-tail risk should result in a lower cost of equity capital. A lower cost of equity capital, coupled with targeted ROE improvement, should be positive for our valuations over time. We want to limit our exposure to any one risk factor, even if current returns are attractive in the related line of business. For example, while we are pleased with new business returns in variable annuities, we have to be mindful of the size of our in-force business when we establish our risk budget for future sales. While balance sheet risk is a primary consideration for capital-intensive products such as variable annuities, we think that earnings volatility is a primary risk factor for protection products and that political risk is a primary consideration for emerging markets. For protection products, policyholder claims will sometimes exceed pricing expectations and cause an earnings shortfall. For example, this quarter, we had below planned underwriting results in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits and a reserve increase on group disability contracts in Australia. While protection-oriented businesses may miss earnings from time to time, we believe that these businesses pose modest balance sheet risk relative to more market-sensitive, capital-intensive products. Furthermore, returns are very attractive in a number of our protection lines of business. For example, Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits is one of our highest-return segments, even with less favorable underwriting performance of this year. For emerging markets, political factors will sometimes generate earnings headwinds. Recent examples would be the potential loss of future earnings related to proposed changes in Poland's pension system, which we discussed on the second quarter earnings call and fiscal developments in Mexico, which John Hele will discuss later on this call. We're willing to accept political risk in emerging markets because we believe this risk is diversifiable and because the products sold in these markets generally have a more favorable risk return profile and growth outlook than products sold in developed markets. Importantly, a balanced approach to risk should produce better and more predictable free cash flow, which is a critical driver of shareholder value. Next, I'd like to provide a brief update on U.S. regulatory matters, which impact the level and timing of capital management. As we discussed last quarter, MetLife remains under Stage 3 review by the Financial Stability Oversight Council for a potential designation as a non-bank systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. While we do not believe that MetLife is systemically important, we continue to make the case to policymakers that applying bank-centric rules to the business of insurance will constrain our ability to issue guarantees and increase the cost of financial protection for consumers. In light of Prudential Financial's decision not to challenge its SIFI designation in federal district court, I suspect you may be wondering what MetLife intends to do. Although it is too early for us to make that decision, we were not ruling out any of the available remedies under Dodd-Frank to contest a SIFI designation. Finally, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing plans for our December investor call. We are taking a different approach this year and will no longer give earnings per share guidance. Instead, the call will provide information that should improve the market's understanding of MetLife's businesses, including our outlook over a multi-year period. I do not believe that we should continue with the practice solely because it is the way it has always been done. After careful study and deliberation, we have determined the EPS guidance no longer makes sense. Others in the financial services industry seem to share this view. Half of our North American peers and most of our global peers do not provide earnings guidance. In addition, the largest U.S. banks do not provide earnings guidance. Our new approach for the December call will be consistent with our internal emphasis on long-term strategic and financial goals and then should shift the discussion to our business model, which is the real driver of shareholder value over time. Also, it is difficult to predict earnings for life insurers with large capital-market-sensitive businesses. So guidance has historically had limited value. While we are rebalancing our business mix, we will still have meaningful exposure to the capital markets for the foreseeable future. We will continue to provide the investment community with our view of run rate earnings along with important earning sensitivities. In addition, we will increase transparency by expanding our discussion of key financial metrics and business drivers. In total, all of these inputs should create a more informed view of MetLife's future prospects. In closing, let me say that after several consecutive quarters of solid performance and results this year that are above plan, we feel very good about our fundamental business prospects. With that, I will turn the call over the John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. As Steve noted, MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.5 billion, up 6% year-over-year and operating earnings per share of $1.34, up 2% year-over-year. This quarter included 3 notable items. The first relates to our group insurance business in Australia. As Steve referenced, we have strengthened group total and permanent disability, otherwise known as TPD, claim reserves in Australia, which reduced operating earnings by $57 million net of reinsurance or $0.05 per share. Our decision to increase the TPD reserve by 45% this quarter was based on the review of our own recent claims experience and consideration of the worsening trend for the industry. We believe there are several factors driving this trend, including economic stress, increased claim size and greater awareness of benefits. The second notable item resulted from our annual actuarial assumption review, which we accelerated from the fourth quarter to the third quarter to be in line with our annual goodwill testing. While there was no charge related to goodwill, there was a modest above- and below-the-line impact from the assumption review. The portion related to operating earnings was a favorable $28 million or $0.03 per share. However, the total impact, including the favorable impact to operating earnings, was a $69 million reduction of net income. Although we had various assumption changes in the quarter, the only meaningful update was in retail annuities. Assumption changes in retail annuities resulted in a $41 million increase in operating earnings and a $48 million reduction of net income. The positive impact above the line primarily relates to an increase in some of our persistency projections and lower expenses. Higher persistency is a positive for operating earnings because of higher expected base contract fees but can be a negative for net income because of potential claim from living benefit guarantees. We have made no further changes to our GMIB dynamic lapse function, and emerging experience is still consistent with the change that we made last year. The third notable item was in our P&C business. We had lower-than-budgeted catastrophe losses of $14 million after tax and a favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million after tax. Therefore, the total benefit to operating earnings was $21 million or $0.02 per share. Turning to our bottom line results. Third quarter net income was $942 million or $0.84 per share and included net derivative losses of $355 million after tax. The net derivative loss in the quarter was driven primarily by 3 items that we consider to be either noneconomic or a cause of asymmetrical accounting treatment: number one, an increase in interest rates; number two, changes in foreign currencies, principally the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound and euro; and number three, the MetLife own credit impact associated with our VA program. Changes in interest rates in the quarter contributed about 60% of the net derivative loss, while foreign currency and MetLife's own credit impact combined for most of the remaining balance. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $47.99 at September 30, up 2% from $47.20 at June 30. Turning to margins. Underwriting was mixed but generally unfavorable again this quarter. The mortality ratio in group life was 90.3% in the quarter, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 88.1% and at the top end of the target range of 85% to 90%. The less favorable mortality was driven by large claims in Group Universal Life and Variable Universal Life. The mortality ratio in retail life was 73.1%, better than our expectation and the 91.3% ratio in the third quarter of 2012. This result was due to favorable direct claims experience in both variable and universal life and traditional life. However, the benefit accrued more to reinsurers than MetLife in the quarter because of the nature of the claims. We expect both the direct mortality ratio and the percentage of claims reinsured to return closer to plan levels in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, useful rules of thumb are a 1% point change in the mortality ratio equals to a quarterly operating earnings impact of $8 million to $10 million for group life and $2 million to $3 million for retail life. Retail life underwriting margins in the quarter were not as favorable as the direct mortality ratio would suggest, partially because of the reinsurance impact and adverse experience in individual disability. The non-medical health benefit ratio was 90.5%, up 2 percentage points from the prior year quarter of 88.5% and just above the top end of the targeted range of 86% to 90%. The primary driver for the increase in the ratio was weaker underwriting results in group disability due to higher severity. Incident rates were generally in line with the prior year quarter and plan. As a reminder, a 1-percentage-point change in the non-medical health benefit ratio equates to an operating earnings impact of approximately $10 million on a quarterly basis. In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 92.6% for retail and 90.2% for group. Year-over-year results were better in retail and somewhat weaker in group. Overall, as mentioned earlier, catastrophes were lower than budget in the quarter by $14 million or $0.01 per share. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 86.3% in retail and 87.5% in group. Next, let me turn to investment spreads. As Steve noted, investment spreads have remained strong and within the range of the past few years. However, we did experience a sequential decline in 3 of the 4 product spreads reported in our quarterly financial supplement, with the simple average declining 23 basis points including variable investment income and 8 basis points excluding variable investment income. In the third quarter, pretax variable investment income was $236 million or $153 million after DAC and taxes, slightly below the midpoint of our 2013 quarterly guidance range. Variable investment income was down from the second quarter, which was at the top end of our guidance range, primarily due to weakness in hedge fund performance and a return to more normal private equity returns, partially offset by higher bond prepays. With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 24.3% in the quarter versus 24.4% in the year-ago period. Excluding the impact of pension and post-retirement benefits and closeouts, the operating expense ratio was 23.6% versus 23.8% in the year-ago period. We are pleased with this performance, as it reflects progress in our strategic goal to reduce gross expenses by $1 billion and net expenses by $600 million. Through 9 months of 2013, gross expense saves were $394 million, while net saves were $269 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $28 million and onetime cost of $97 million. I will now discuss some of the business highlights in the quarter and focus on areas where our results seem to differ from analyst expectations. Retail operating earnings were $659 million, up 34% versus the prior year quarter, driven by strong performance in both life and other and annuities. Life and other reported operating earnings of $237 million, up 16% year-over-year. The primary drivers were lower DAC amortization and lower policyholder dividends. These are partially offset by less favorable catastrophe loss experience from an exceptionally good prior year quarter and lower variable investment income. Annuities reported operating earnings of $422 million, up 47% versus the prior year quarter. The drivers included higher fees from separate account growth, resulting from strong investment performance, lower ongoing DAC amortization and favorable assumption unlockings. The initial market impact was favorable to operating earnings by $27 million after tax, which was $3 million less in the prior year quarter. As a forward-looking rule of thumb, a 1-percentage-point change in the S&P 500 equates to approximately $5 million to $7 million of operating earnings annually. Variable annuity sales were $2.7 billion in the quarter, down 41% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. We expect full year VA sales to be at the top end of our $10 billion to $11 billion target. As of September 30, the net amount of risk for all of GMIB riders was down to $931 million, which compares to $2.5 billion at March 31 as presented at our May investor day. The net amount of risk for all GMIB Max contracts is only $2 million. In addition, only 7.3% of total GMIB contracts were in the money as of September 30, which compares to 17.9% at March 31, which is also presented at investor day. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $226 million, down 20% year-over-year. The primary drivers were weaker underwriting results in group life and disability, higher expenses due to reinvestment in the business and less favorable catastrophe experience versus a favorable result a year ago. Latin America reported operating earnings of $133 million, down 13% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency basis. These results reflected the impact of favorable onetime adjustments, particularly in the prior year, higher expenses due to sales initiatives in the region and weaker underwriting results partially offset by net favorable market impacts. Premium fees and other revenues were up 14% year-over-year and 17% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth across the region. Sales growth was only 4%, but excluding 1 large group case in the prior year quarter, growth would have been 11%. I want to comment on 2 topics that are important to consider for future earnings for Latin America: Provida and fiscal policy changes in Mexico. As Steve noted, we closed on the acquisition of Provida. With the completion of the tender offer on October 1, we currently own 91.4% of Provida at a cost of approximately USD 1.85 billion. Provida is performing well and in line with our expectations. Our ownership percentage is less than we had modeled, but this is fully offset by a lower opportunity cost of funds. In Mexico, we are assessing the potential impact from fiscal policy changes currently being implemented. We believe the annual impact could dampen operating earnings by approximately $25 million. Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $257 million, down 1% year-over-year but up 7% on a constant currency basis. Operating earnings were dampened by the previously discussed reserve strengthening in Australia and an unfavorable impact from the assumption review, partially offset by a tax benefit in Japan. Adjusting for these items, operating earnings were 17% driven by business growth and lower expenses. While we were pleased with the underlying performance in the quarter, we do not believe that 17% is a sustainable growth rate. As anticipated, surrender activity of non-yen fixed annuities in Japan returned to a more normal level in the third quarter. We believe a more normal level of quarterly earnings for Asia is approximately $280 million to $300 million. Finally, in EMEA, operating earnings were $85 million, up 37% year-over-year and 28% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by business growth across the region, especially in Russia, Poland and Turkey, lower expenses and certain onetime items. This was a strong quarter for EMEA. A more normal level of quarterly earnings is in the low to mid-$17 million range. Premium fees and other revenues were 8% -- were up 8% year-over-year and 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth in Russia and the impact of the Aviva acquisition in the third quarter of 2012. Overall sales growth for EMEA was 10%, driven by emerging market growth of 21%, most notably in the Gulf, Turkey and Russia. Now I will discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.8 billion at the end of the third quarter. As you know, we report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. In Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 913% as of the second quarter of 2013. For our domestic insurance companies in the third quarter, preliminary statutory results are operating earnings of $720 million and net income of $475 million. Statutory operating earnings were down $382 million from the prior year, primarily due to higher taxes of $365 million in the current quarter as a result of various tax adjustments. For the first 9 months of 2013, statutory operating earnings were $2.1 billion and statutory net income was $1.2 billion. Total adjusted capital for our domestic insurance companies is expected to be approximately $27.6 billion as of September 30, down 5% from December 31, primarily due to dividends paid of $1.3 billion, unrealized losses essentially offset net income. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners.
Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC: I had a question about Health Care Reform. Wondering how meaningful of an opportunity you think that could be for MetLife over the next several years and also, what your strategy is to participate in private exchanges.
William J. Wheeler: Ryan, it's Bill Wheeler. So there's a lot of aspects to Health Care Reform, so I'd break it down in a couple of ways. One is we are -- our dental product is on a number of the state exchanges that are up now or selling now. Obviously, our sales there are pretty nominal. But -- and we have also put our products, not just dental but a broad array of products, on a number of private exchanges. I think we are up to 10 private exchanges. And our expectation has been for a number of years is that employers are going to start and employees are going to start using these exchanges to buy benefits and to give employees more choice in the type of voluntary worksite benefits they provide. And so a big strategy for us, which we've laid our previously, is to expand our product set and our enrollment capabilities in the voluntary worksite aspect of the business. And so we think that is a big opportunity for us and a big source of growth in our group area. Now I guess, I will also just say that the last thing that I think is happening right now is, of course, the Affordable Care Act is having a lot of difficulty, and I think one interesting aspect is I believe that you're going to see a lot of employees really start to value their employee benefits and the benefits they get from their employer and I think be -- and value them more highly. And I think in the long run, that's going to be a really good thing for our group business.
Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC: And just a follow-up, in addition to your typical suite of group and voluntary benefits, will you be looking to be a bigger player in supplemental health as well?
William J. Wheeler: Well, yes. So labels are -- let's be careful. So we definitely will be a bigger player in critical illness and accident and health products. But I would -- the true med supp kind of products, I don't think we're going to be entering.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I wanted to first touch just on VA. Obviously, you and the industry have done a lot in terms of managing down sales, done everything from increasing fees, lowering guarantees, et cetera, and yet, these things still kind of seem to stick and sell. And you just saw a competitor look at doing a reinsurance transaction or announce a reinsurance transaction to keep capacity in the market. I'm wondering if this is something you would consider potentially as you continue to work on customer centricity.
William J. Wheeler: Chris, it's Bill again. Sure, I mean, I think we'll look at this transaction. I mean, this is -- and we obviously read that announcement with interest. And the devil's in the details and we will try to understand the details of that trade. Look, we always look at ways to manage our capacity and capital. But I think Steve made it pretty clear earlier in the call. We've -- we're going to rebalance the risk profile of MetLife, and that means we are going to stay in the variable annuity business, but we're going to run it a certain way. And I think that's -- and I think that way is working.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then one for Steve and maybe Chris. If you can comment just on the operations in Japan. I guess, there's been some increased press and chatter around maybe some elevated turnover of management, certainly changes in commission structures that you guys have talked about in the past. So I just wanted to kind of get your assessment of the strategy for the reason -- in the region and what you guys are doing to kind of continue to accelerate growth while maintain good returns.
Christopher G. Townsend: Sure. Let me take that. It's Chris Townsend here. So first of all, in terms of the management changes, yes, we have changed some of the management there. The -- Sachin Shah is our CEO of that business. He's been the COO of that business for approximately 3 years, and has a very deep life insurance background and has good tenure in Japan as well. The bench in Japan is very deep, and we supplemented that in terms of some of the new areas we're looking to build capability in with some strong external hires. So we're very comfortable with the management team we have in Japan. If you look at the business overall in Japan, we've said to you for a number of quarters that our bank sales are soft given the fact that the Nikkei and TOPIX have performed so well, and all that volatility in the yen, what that's led to is rather depressed sales in the fixed annuity foreign currency products. That's actually bounced back this third quarter now. Bank sales were up about 54% sequentially, but they're still down 20% year-on-year. And what that's meant, overall, is that Japan is down on sales about 4%. What I would say is that A&H sales in Japan are up, and across the region, we're up about 9% on A&H. So again, we feel pretty good in terms of the mix of the business we've got. The A&H portfolio overall is competitive. You'll hear that from a number of others, who are approaching this market, but we feel that the deep experience we've got plus that multi-channel platform, which is rather unique for us in the Japanese market, gives us a great ability to grow that business very well in terms of the bundling ratio we have across the other life products.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just new business returns, any sense of kind of what you're pricing for or seeing?
Christopher G. Townsend: Yes, we're pricing for a 15% EC ROI we -- as we've told you a number of times before, and that's across the portfolio. So clearly, there's going to be some products, which perform better than others in different cycles, and we're continuing to tweak that portfolio in line with some of the volatile macroeconomic conditions. So as interest rate changes, reserve rate changes, we'll tweak our portfolio. But overall, our portfolio is exceeding the 15% EC ROI.
Operator: And next we'll go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Crédit Suisse.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: First question for Steve, just the decision to discontinue the explicit earnings guidance. Can you give a little more color behind that decision in terms of why discontinue it? And relatedly, are there any meaningful changes to the growth rates that you had previously discussed, either domestically or internationally, as we think about '14, '15. Because that's obviously a logical question as part of what's behind us, the fact that the news may not be as good.
Steven A. Kandarian: We really looked at all the literature that was written -- that has been written on this issue of giving earnings guidance. There's some literature that says you should give it. There's a lot of literature that says you shouldn't give it, and they give kind of the pros and cons and so on. But the bottom line really from our perspective was if earnings guidance really provides information that's useful in investors and analysts better understanding our business and earnings for the coming year, then we should give it. And our view was because of the capital market sensitivity of our overall business and the impact of things like the equity market returns, this wasn't all that useful to people to get our earnings guidance on a specific point or number for EPS in the coming year. We thought that if we gave you further information, more information on other parts of our business and sensitivities, that people could build their own models based upon their view of, let's say, what the S&P 500 will do next year or what interest rates will be or other factors that could influence the short-term earnings of MetLife. There is some literature that says that those who drop earnings guidance do so in some cases because their prospects aren't as bright as they had been or they're going through some transition in their business model. That is not the case for us. This really was a fresh look at should we give guidance or not give guidance as if we were just starting off as an IPO. Would you -- should you really do this in our business or not? We looked at our peers, like we said in the script earlier, that it's pretty split in the United States in terms of providing guidance in our industry. In Europe, most don't give guidance in our industry. And then other financial institutions, especially the larger banks that have the same kind of sensitivity to capital markets, virtually none of them give guidance. They give a lot of components that allowed people to come up with their own numbers. We just thought that was a better way to do it, and we thought if we were starting off today fresh, that's what we would do.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Understood. Yes, appreciate that response. The next question I had is for John or Bill. The higher severity of claims in group life and disability, is there a chance that this might continue, that this might be a sign of some pricing actions you need to take? Any clarity there?
William J. Wheeler: Tom, it's Bill. Well, when we have a chance to reprice cases, we obviously look at the individual experience, and I'm there'll be some cases we'll reprice and raise prices. That's just the nature of the beast when the -- in the pricing cycle. But because the underwriting results were really about incidents, not -- or really about severity and not incidents, that kind of tells you it's more than likely more random and -- than expectations. And we do see this occasionally. I guess, we feel that -- and it was severity, higher severity in both group life and disability. So I think we feel that it's a sort of normal underwriting volatility if you will and doesn't cause us to think that we're going to have to significantly change our pricing expectations.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And then just one last one. The Mexico, the comment on fiscal policy changes having a $25 million negative impact, is that going to impact your goodwill related to that some prior acquisitions at all?
John C. R. Hele: Yes. Tom, this is John. No, we don't believe this would impact our goodwill.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I just have a question for you on the regulatory front. So recently the Fed, among some others, issued a proposal that looks like it's going to further increase the liquidity requirements for some of this -- or for the systemic banks. But that proposal, at least by our read, seems to specifically exclude the -- this requirement for SIFI insurance companies. And I guess, my question is twofold. Is that consistent with your read as well that it would exclude insurers? And second, do you think it's going too far if we read into that exclusion of insurers and increasing recognition by the regulators of some of the key differences between traditional banks and insurance companies at least in terms of balance sheet and liquidity profiles? I guess, I'm asking, Steve, you mentioned continuing to sort of work to educate regulators, so do you feel like you're making any real progress in that front?
Steven A. Kandarian: We've read that rule as well, and that is our interpretation that designated non-bank SIFIs in the insurance space would not be subject to that rule. That's our interpretation of what we read. It's consistent with what you said. And in terms of what we should we interpret from that, I think it's a positive. I don't want to read too much into it, but clearly, regulators are looking at the differences in the business model of banking versus the business model of insurance. There are significant differences. Banks rely upon much more on short-term funding. They have more asset liability mismatches as part of their business model, and we rely upon largely longer-term funding sources. Overall, we match our assets and our liabilities and just kind of run on the bank issues that can exist in a crisis situation don't really apply to the insurance industries. I think there's becoming greater recognition of the differences in the business model between our 2 industries in Washington. And we worked hard as others have as well in the industry to try to provide insights and help in Washington in terms of understanding our business model, and we have to all acknowledge that insurance has been regulated now for decades at the state level, not the federal level. So they're starting from a point in terms of overseeing our industry that's fairly new for them. So it's understandable that there is kind of a education process going on. I think this is a positive sign, but again, I don't want to read too much into it.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Yes, I understand. And then I just have one question on pension closeouts. Given, obviously, some great equity market strengths and good investment performance and at least here recently, some slightly higher longer-term rates, it looks like funding status sort of across of the Fortune 500 defined benefit pension plans has really gotten much, much better. I'm just wondering, maybe for Bill, if that's helping to improve the dialogue and the opportunity set and what your outlook is there.
William J. Wheeler: Well, yes, with regard to pension closeouts, I don't think there's any doubt that the environment is getting better. And so -- and we see that in our, what I would call, our normal business, new business pipeline. It's growing. It's -- in terms of the amount of the transactions that are out there to do. But they're not jumbo deals. I mean, the jumbo deals are -- I mean, obviously, by their very nature, they're kind of one-off, and we don't have visibility on big jumbo deals right now. But I would say the more traditional smaller cases, the pipeline is large. And so we -- our expectation is, is that there's going to be more volume there.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. So -- and that's what I was sort of most curious about, as these funding gaps sort of get closer and closer to 0, or at least lower, with company CFOs and Treasurers essentially decide, "Hey, look, this is getting much better. We don't need to pursue this." Or would they go the other way, and it sounds like you're saying it goes the other way.
William J. Wheeler: I think so. We're seeing a number of transactions. Sizes are getting a lot little bigger. There's clearly a lot of activity.
Operator: And next we'll go to the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Wanted to ask a question about the annual assumption review. John, I think you talked about, particularly on the VA business, a good guide above the line and a $90 million kind of hit below the line. I was wondering if you could just expand on really what drove maybe the $90 million. And I assume it was the lapse rate assumption. And does it in any meaningful way change kind of the all-in economics of the in-force VA block in your view?
John C. R. Hele: This assumption review, we included some GMWBs that we have and some LWG,, and we are now more experienced on those and looked at the lapses and installed a lapse function closer to what we did a year ago for the GMIBs. We didn't have enough experience on this block until this year on that block, and so it drove the same sort of structure where you saw more persistency expected over time, which drives higher core fees in the business. So you amortize over longer period of time, but then you have higher cost of the benefit below the line, which is where the fees, the rider fees for these benefits feed below the line into net income to match against the derivative hedging that we do against it. So we try to match the revenues in net income with the costs there, and that's why there's a higher net present value of future costs for those withdrawal benefit costs.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I guess, any change in how kind of how you view the economics of the business?
John C. R. Hele: No, I mean, this changes it a little bit, but in terms of the overall book, we view the new business as well priced. the older book needs capital and has a lower ROE than the new business. I would like to point out that in this whole assumption review across the U.S., there wasn't any change to our thinking of long-term interest rates, and we did adjust our maintenance expenses in the retail annuity business. We're a little lower. We've got a larger book, and that helped a little bit. The other major assumption that we haven't looked at yet that we spoke about at investor day is what we do with annuitization rates and we still -- although those are favorable, we haven't made any assumption changes on those yet. We're leaving that. We need some more time before we would think about changing those.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. Just a quick question on the Australian business. I guess, when you talked about Mexico, you talked about a $25 million potential kind of hit to earnings going forward. You took a charge in Australia similar to what others have seen. I'm just curious what the delta on earnings of the Australian block kind of from what you've experienced to what you'd expect going forward will be.
John C. R. Hele: We don't expect a dramatic change to the ongoing profits in Australia. That makes $20 million, $30 million a year. And we did a reserve charge on this business. This business has been around for a while. It's a rider to people's pension savings programs, and there's been an industry change in the incidents in this business. We only had a few cases, a handful of cases where we've had to adjust. And 2, in particular, drove most of the reserve change. We've done an extensive work on this. It's been reflected across the industry, and we set the reserves appropriately.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: So the $20 million to $30 million of contribution should still hold going forward essentially?
John C. R. Hele: Yes.
Operator: And next we'll go to the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I just had a question on spreads and thinking about kind of the modest declines on a adjusted basis. Corporate Benefit Funding, that's been a segment that's been a positive offset there. Could you just remind us sort of the liability and asset structure of Corporate Benefit Funding in terms of why spreads there have positively increased over the last 4 or 5 quarters?
William J. Wheeler: Sure. So Corporate Benefit Funding, the liabilities are very long, and they're often fixed in terms of the interest rate assumptions that are embedded in the liability. So it's a very fixed-rate liability, and it's long. So the way the target investment portfolio there would have more variable investment income in it, more private equity investments, real estate, et cetera, so if those investments perform, which they have, obviously, and we've had outsized performance in that particular part of the portfolio, it will do well. The other thing, too, is the only place where -- so we have the ability to invest very long and obviously, match quite well, and I think that's why that portfolio holds up much better than others, which I think are shorter-term liabilities.
John C. R. Hele: I'm going to add to that because we have quite a deal of assets in here, we often use this for securities lending programs. And so far this year, we've had a pretty steep yield curve on the short end, and that's benefited the additional benefit we get from securities lending in this portfolio. So that's a function of just the very steep yield curve on the short -- on the very short end.
Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And just in terms of thinking about the volatility on the adjusted spread, is that mostly from bond prepays, this is looking across the 4 different units? Or are there other elements that could cause the adjusted spread that you now provide us to bounce around?
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: It's Steve Goulart. Just on -- if you look at the quarter, John went through some of the details on VII, but -- so we did see hedge funds and private equity kind of returning to normal or even lower than planned. But bond prepayments have been strong for the year and particularly for the quarter. And again, because of the process, the time it takes to complete a prepayment, we actually have pretty good insight into what the fourth quarter will look like as well. And so I think we're anticipating prepayments to be a good contributor to our of VII for the fourth quarter and why we'll probably be near the top of the expected range then as well.
Operator: And next we'll go to the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: First question for John on holding company cash. I think you said $4.8 billion down from $6.5 billion in the second quarter. I'm guessing most of that is the Provida payment. Just wondering, as you look across the fourth quarter, should we expect any big pluses and minuses with respect to the holding company cash.
John C. R. Hele: We expect to be at the high end of our range we gave you on investor day. So you're pretty close there.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And is there anything in particular that's sending you to the high end of the range or just better earnings?
John C. R. Hele: No, there's -- no big -- there's some plusses and minuses always we have in cash in the company of this size, so it just -- it trends along. With dividends paying out, we have cash coming in. So it should end up to be at the high end of our range we had.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then, I guess, more of a philosophical question for Steve on the divided. Obviously, earlier this year, you increased your dividend, I think, to a payout ratio of around 20%. As we think about what -- how you're thinking about dividend growth going forward, should we anticipate that, that dividend will probably grow in line with earnings, meaning you'll kind of be at a stable payout ratio? Or do you anticipate that, that payout ratio might start to climb in the future?
Steven A. Kandarian: Suneet, Our goal is to increase dividends at a fairly steady pace over time along with our earnings. But as we've mentioned before, because of the uncertainty around regulation, we have to take into account whatever it is we learn from potential new capital rules that might apply to MetLife, in fact, into our consideration, in our judgment in terms of how to handle dividends going forward.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then just the last question, I wanted to follow up on, I think, one of Tom Gallagher's questions that I'm not sure you answered about the -- anything changing in terms of the guidance. I guess, if I think back to November of 2011 when we did the interest rate discussion, you talked about sort of an 8% earnings growth rate in a normal environment, maybe 4% excluding -- in a low-interest-rate environment. I know we're going to get a lot more detail in December in terms of sensitivities, but at a high level, would you argue that, that guidance would still be appropriate, particularly given some of the changes you've made in the U.S. business around shrinking the variable annuity business and making some adjustments on the UL with the no lapse guarantee?
Steven A. Kandarian: Well, we're on track in terms of our strategy that we've outlined a number of times to you. In terms of specifics around guidance, we'll provide that shortly in the December call.
Operator: And next we'll go to the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I had a couple of questions. First, on the assumptions amendment embedded in your Australia charge, you took a pretty large charge. But what gives you the comfort that you're adequately deserved there? And the reason I'm asking is other companies have taken similar charges as well, some before you guys, and in many cases, they've taken repeated charges. So -- and then secondly, you mentioned the $20 million -- $25 million impact from the fiscal changes in Mexico. Can you just discuss this in a little bit more detail and the potential steps that you could take, if there are any, to mitigate the impact?
John C. R. Hele: Jimmy, this is John. So this has been an industry trend, and of course, some reinsurers who can see across the whole industry reacted last quarter. As I said, we only had a handful of cases, although they were larger cases where we've been looking at this trend. So we've studied it very carefully. We've benefited from speaking to the reinsurers and thinking about this across the board. We've done extensive studies on this, and we believe we're adequate -- adequately reserved. However, if things change again in the future, you can always -- you may have to relook at it again if trends change from where they are. But we believe we've captured the current trends underway in Australia, in this area.
William J. Wheeler: Jimmy, it's Bill. With regard to Mexico, what's going on there is they -- the Mexican Congress has been going through a series of fiscal reforms or approving a series of fiscal reforms announced by the Mexican President, Peña Nieto. And I guess, I would say that we believe some of those changes with regard to taxes, we can mitigate. And some, we probably will not be able to. And the -- and so there are -- sort of our best guess, but we're not done with our work yet. Is it -- the impact might be $25 million after tax next year. And it's -- there's taxes on corporate income. There's taxes on dividends. There's other government programs with which we participate in that might be changed. So there's sort a package of things going on. And my guess is, is we'll give you a little more color on that in December.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then maybe if I could ask just one more on guidance, and I think there's always skepticism when a company withdraws guidance on whether it signals that things are getting worse, at least, in the short term. And you gave reasons, which are all valid, but -- especially that it's difficult predicting where the markets are quarter-to-quarter and having to adjust. So people could always use their own market assumptions anyway. So that was the case even when you were giving guidance before. And even though most of the banks don't give guidance, most insurance companies do. So I was wondering if there's anything more behind that. Maybe like, obviously, if a company does give guidance and sort of forces management to focus on the short term a little bit just to be able to hold the results up to that. So maybe discuss a little bit more why this is not a signal that things are getting worse, and there were something else besides the items that you mentioned that went into your decision?
Steven A. Kandarian: I think you hit one of the items that is worth highlighting, Jimmy, which is sometimes, giving a point estimate, even a range for next year's earnings, can make management teams and companies focus too much on short-term results. So our goal here is to increase shareholder value over time, and when I say, over time, I don't mean over a decade. I mean, over the next few years. And we had to just make sure that, that's our focus as a company. We're going to give a lot of inputs for all of you in December on our investor day call to construct your own models in terms of your assumptions around interest rates, equity values for next year and so on, to create your own number that you come up with. But as we look back and we look at our own earnings guidance numbers over the last decade and sort of how close were we to what the actual results turned out to be, what did The Street come up with on their own after we adjusted of guidance. And we weren't that great in terms of predicting, frankly. So our view as we're spending way too much time on factors that really are not within our control, like equity values in the coming year and so on. And rather than have that be such a big piece of the conversation, let's kind of shift it to our business model, our strategy, the things that really matter, the sensitivity analysis that we go through. So I think you'll see in December, we're going to give you more information you've gotten before from us, but you're just not going to get a point estimate for next year's earnings.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Edward A. Spehar: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings press release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment income and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another strong quarter, with most financial metrics exceeding our plan. Second quarter 2013 operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 11% over the second quarter of 2012. Operating earnings per share were $1.44, a 7% increase over the prior year period, and operating return on equity was 12.3%. This quarter's results reflect the continuation of our strategic shift away from capital-intensive, market-sensitive products to high-return, lower-risk product lines, as well as our strategy to grow emerging markets. This shift was evident with variable annuity sales down 40% versus the prior year period, while sales rose 28% in our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits segment; 32% in Latin America; and 32% in the emerging markets within our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment. Our investment margins were favorable again in this quarter as a result of good variable investment income, effective asset/liability management and income from derivatives, many of which were purchased in the mid-2000s to protect earnings under a low rate scenario. In the second quarter, our average investment spread across all U.S. product lines was the top end of the roughly 200- to 250-basis-point range experienced during the past few years. To help you think about the impact of interest rates on earnings, I refer you to the low interest rate stress scenario in our 2012 10-K. We said that the continuation of the late 2012 interest rate environment in the U.S. through year-end 2014 would reduce our operating earnings by $45 million in 2013 and $150 million in 2014 relative to plan. In late 2012, the 10-year treasury yield was 1.69%. Our plan assumed rates would steadily increase and reach to 2.38% by year-end 2013, and then remain at this level through 2014. In addition, credit spreads were tighter in late 2012 than assumed in our plan. Today, the 10-year treasury yield is approximately 2.6% or slightly above our plan assumption, and credit spreads have widened, which puts them roughly in line with our plan. With a rate environment only slightly more favorable than our plan, we did not assume investment margins will expand as a result of the recent increase in interest rates. To be sure, higher interest rates are a positive development, but the benefits for MetLife are reduced risk of margin compression and balance sheet charges. Now I would like to provide an update on customer centricity, followed by some comments on the regulatory environment. We continue to expand significant effort on the 4 cornerstones of our strategic plan because they are firmly within our control and critical to becoming a world-class organization. Regulatory outcomes by contrast are only partially within our control, but require no less effort, given their potential impact on our long-term competitive position. Customer centricity is an important element of our strategy, and while it won't show up in the numbers overnight, it can help create an enduring competitive advantage for MetLife. I have noted in the past that MetLife and the life insurance industry have not done as good a job of delivering exceptional customer experiences as some other industries. Simply put, we are just too hard to do business with. As a result of important simplification work we are doing around the globe, we have early indications that enhancing the customer experience not only increases customer satisfaction but also reduces additional work and ultimately, lowers cost for MetLife. Results in several areas, faster call handling, improved self-service, first-contact customer resolution and streamlined claims processing, bear this out. In Korea, improved technology has dramatically reduced telephone wait times, with 86% of calls answered in less than 20 seconds today, up from 47% before the upgrade. In the U.S., simple fixes to our website tripled customer use of our online change of address process and virtually eliminated related customer complaints. In the U.S. and Mexico, call center representatives, newly empowered with better tools and technology, are now resolving 60% of customer problems in a single contact, up from 45%. And in Poland, a redesigned claims process, including simpler forms, reduced documentation requirements and proactive status updates to customers, reduced life insurance claim payments turnaround times by 30% from 5.6 days to 3.9 days. There is still much work to be done, but I am encouraged by our early progress on improving the MetLife customer experience. Now let me offer a few observations on the regulatory environment. As you know, on July 18, the Financial Stability Board designated MetLife and 8 other insurance companies as globally systemically important insurers or GSIIs. Our understanding is that being named a GSII has no legal effect unless MetLife is designated a systemically important financial institution or SIFI by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. If we are designated a SIFI, MetLife would be subject to enhanced prudential standards promulgated by the Federal Reserve. Furthermore, the Fed will have to determine whether to subject U.S.-based GSIIs to additional supervision and prudential rules. Two days before we were named a GSII, FSOC voted to advance MetLife to Stage 3 of the SIFI designation process. As I said at the time, I do not believe that MetLife is a systemically important financial institution. The life insurance industry is a source of financial stability. Even during periods of financial stress, the long-term nature of insurance liabilities protects against bank-like runs and the need to sell assets quickly. For pure protection products, the company makes no payment unless an insured event occurs, so there's no way to accelerate the liabilities. For products that include a savings component, there are strong disincentives to surrender and cash out. Not only can policyholders face surrender charges and tax penalties, but they may find it difficult to purchase new policies if they had to be medically re-underwritten. The existence of the state-based guarantee funds provides a further incentive for customers to hold on to their policies. Importantly, state insurance regulators have the ability to halt surrenders in the event of financial distress and have typically done so. As a practical matter, being moved to Stage 3 means that FSOC can request nonpublic financial information to examine a company's potential for systemic risk. During the process, MetLife is permitted to submit additional information to FSOC, demonstrating that our business does not pose systemic risk. It's unclear how long we will remain in Stage 3 of the designation process. Our only frame of reference from the insurance industry is the experience of AIG and Prudential, both of which spent more than 7 months in Stage 3. After Stage 3 is complete, a 2/3 vote of FSOC is needed for a proposed determination that a company is a SIFI, including an affirmative vote by the chairperson, who is The Secretary of the Treasury. If a company receives a notice of proposed determination, it has 30 days to request a nonpublic hearing to appeal the decision. FSOC then has 30 days to hold the hearing and another 60 days post hearing to make a final determination, which again requires a 2/3 vote of FSOC, including an affirmative vote by the chairperson. At that point, a company may bring action in U.S. district court, seeking to have the determination rescinded. The critical question for insurers designated as SIFIs is what the prudential rules will look like. Will they be bank-like capital rules or rules appropriate for the business model of insurance? Senator Susan Collins of Maine helped put this issue in perspective in a letter to the federal banking regulators last fall. For context, Senator Collins sponsored a provision on the Dodd-Frank Act requiring capital standards for nonbank SIFIs to be no less rigorous than those that apply to banks. In her letter, she said, "it was not Congress' intent that federal regulators supplant prudential state-based insurance regulation with a bank-centric capital regime." We strongly believe that insurance companies should be regulated differently than banks. As I've said many times, if life insurers are subjected to capital rules designed for banks, MetLife's ability to issue guarantees would be constrained. We'd have to raise the price of products we offer to consumers or stop offering certain products all together. To be clear, we strongly support prudential regulation of the life insurance industry. After all, we are financially liable for insolvencies to the state-based guarantee funds. What is imperative is that the rules be tailored to the business model of insurance. In closing, while the regulatory environment remains fluid, we are delivering strong financial performance today and executing on our strategy to generate increasing shareholder value over time. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our second quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash, capital and guidance. As Steve noted, MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.6 billion or $1.44 per share, up 11% year-over-year. This quarter included a few notable items, all in our EMEA region. The first relates to our pension business in Poland. In June, the government of Poland announced 3 proposals, and any one of these 3 would materially change the country's pension system. A change in the system is expected before the end of the year, with implementation occurring sometime in 2014. We expect that the economics of our pension business will be materially altered in Poland, resulting in either a significant reduction or the elimination of our pension assets under management, which were approximately $7 billion as of June 30. Therefore, we have written off the entire DAC and VOBA balance related to this business, resulting in an after-tax charge of $26 million or $0.02 per share in the second quarter. Going forward, our preliminary estimate is that this change to the Polish pension system will reduce EMEA's operating earnings by $15 million to $30 million annually. Also in EMEA, we had a couple of onetime tax items this quarter. The first was a tax benefit of $52 million, as we made an APB 23 assertion for the region. This was partially offset by a $30 million write-off of a deferred tax asset related to our U.K. wealth management business due to regulatory changes that made future sales growth and profits less certain for this startup operation. The net benefit of these 2 items was $22 million or $0.02 per share. Turning to our bottom line results. Second quarter net income was $471 million or $0.43 per share and included net derivative losses of $1.1 billion after tax. The net derivative loss in the quarter was driven primarily by 3 items that we consider to be either noneconomic or a cause of asymmetrical accounting treatment. These are: number one, an increase in interest rates; number two, changes in foreign currencies, principally the weakening of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar; and number three, the MetLife-owned credit impact associated with our VA program. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $47.20 at June 30, down modestly from March 31. This slight decline was a function of modest net income due to the net derivative loss and 2 quarterly dividends declared in the quarter. Turning to margins. Underwriting was generally unfavorable this quarter. The mortality ratio in retail life was 89.7% due to unfavorable experience in both variable and universal life and traditional life. This result was higher than our expectation for the quarter and worse than the 85.6% ratio in the second quarter of 2012. The mortality ratio in group life was 86.5% in the quarter, favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.3% and well within the target of 85% to 90%. The improvement in the mortality ratio was driven by lower Group Universal Life claims experience. As a reminder, a 1-percentage-point change in mortality ratio equates to quarterly operating earnings impact of approximately $2 million to $3 million for retail life and $8 million to $10 million for group life. The Non-Medical Health benefit ratio was 89.5%, up 210 basis points from the prior year quarter of 87.4% and at the top end of the targeted range of 86% to 90%. The primary driver for the increase in the ratio was weaker underwriting results in long-term care due to higher incidence and to a lesser extent, an increase in the average claim size. However, we are seeing an improvement in disability underwriting results as the overall claims incidence trend continues to be favorable. As a reminder, a 1-percentage-point change in the Non-Medical Health benefit ratio equates to an operating earnings impact of approximately $10 million on a quarterly basis. In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 107.5% for Retail and 97.7% for group. Retail was impacted by higher-than-budget catastrophes in the Midwest. Overall, catastrophes were higher than budgeted in the quarter by $16 million or $0.01 per share. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were higher year-over-year in both Retail and group at 86.1% and 92.1%, respectively. The increase was driven by elevated non-catastrophe weather-related losses and lower favorable prior year reserve development. Next, let me turn to investment spreads. In our QFS, you will note that the spreads remain strong and are higher versus the prior year quarter across all major product lines in the U.S., driven by higher variable investment income and derivative income. A simple average of the investment spreads in our U.S. businesses were 244 basis points this quarter, which compares to 231 basis points in the second quarter of 2012 and 235 basis points in the second quarter of 2011. This progression illustrates the resilience of our investment margins despite a challenging interest rate environment. In the quarter, pretax variable investment income was $312 million, reflecting strong returns from private equities and hedge funds. After DAC and taxes, variable investment income was $202 million or slightly less than $0.01 per share above the top end of our 2012 -- 2013 quarterly guidance range. With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.5% for the second quarter. Excluding the impact of pension and postretirement benefits and closeouts, the operating expense ratio was 22.8%. This compares favorably to the second quarter of 2012, which had an operating expense ratio of 23.7% and 23.4% excluding pension and postretirement benefits and closeouts. We are pleased with this performance as it reflects progress on our strategic goal to reduce net expenses by $600 million. Through the first half of 2013, gross expense saves were $248 million, while net saves were $173 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $12 million and onetime costs of $63 million. I will now discuss some of the business highlights in the quarter. Rather than go through every segment, I will focus on areas where our results may have differed from your expectations. Therefore, my comments will be on Retail annuities, Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, Corporate Benefit Funding, Latin America and Asia. Retail annuities reported operating earnings of $368 million, up $142 million or 63% versus the prior year quarter. The earnings drivers were comprised of several factors, including favorable market impact, lower ongoing DAC amortization, lower operating expenses and higher net investment income. Variable annuities sales were $2.8 billion in the quarter, down 40% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. We continue to target full year VA sales of $10 billion to $11 billion. Effective August 12, we are eliminating sub-pays for all GMIB Max and Enhanced Death Benefit Max products, other than our current product, GMIB Max V. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $275 million, up 3% year-over-year. As I mentioned previously, underwriting results were unfavorable in long-term care and property and casualty, and this was a case both year-over-year and relative to our expectations. However, improved investments and expense margins were effective offsets to less favorable underwriting margins. Turning to Corporate Benefit Funding. Operating earnings were $350 million, up 10% year-over-year. The growth was driven by improvements in investment and underwriting margins. Investment margins improved as a result of lower credit interest, primarily on capital markets products, and higher variable investment income. The increase in underwriting margins was primarily driven by a mortality gain in the U.S. pensions business. In Latin America, operating earnings were $125 million, down 7% year-over-year and 11% on a constant-currency basis due to adverse mark-to-market investment results in Brazil and Mexico, the impact of inflation in Mexico and Chile and higher expenses primarily due to business initiatives in the region. While bottom line results were pressured, underlying business growth in the region drove solid top line performance. Premium fees and other revenues were up 12% year-over-year and 8% on a constant-currency basis, driven by growth in worksite marketing in Mexico, group insurance in Brazil and direct marketing in Argentina. In addition, total sales in Latin America were up 32% year-over-year, with strong growth in all countries. In Mexico, sales growth was driven by increases in Retail and Group products. In Chile, the sales increase was driven by growth in the agency force. In Argentina, the increase was driven by direct marketing. And finally, sales growth in Brazil was driven by higher accident and health sales. Turning to Asia. Operating results were $330 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year and 27% on a constant-currency basis. Earnings were driven by underlying business growth; higher fee income from the surrender of foreign currency fixed annuity products in Japan; and strong equity market performance in Japan, which resulted in a decline in variable life guaranteed minimum death benefit reserves that benefited operating earnings by $19 million. This quarter, we again saw higher surrender activity in Japan, which was an item we've highlighted on our last call. This is the result of customers harvesting gains in foreign-currency-denominated fixed annuity products, denominated in Australian and U.S. dollars. We believe that customers have shifted assets into equities, which continue to perform very well. In the quarter, surrender fees in excess of plan contributed $35 million to Asia's operating earnings. We expect that surrender fees will decline significantly in the second half of the year. In addition, as a result of elevated surrenders in the first half of the year, we would expect to see a reduction to operating earnings by slightly less than $15 million annually. Finally, Asia's second quarter operating earnings were $9 million lower than our plan as a result of yen weakness relative to the U.S. dollar. As we have stated previously, we have hedges for our 2013 projected yen-exposed operating earnings at strike prices at around JPY 90 to the U.S. dollar. These hedges are currency options which provide protection against the yen weakening beyond JPY 90, but allow us to participate if the upside should the yen strengthen. Our protection now extends to the third quarter of 2014, with currency options at around JPY 90 in place for the first quarter, around JPY 95 in the second and in the range of JPY 95 to JPY 100 for the third quarter. Now I will discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. The increase was driven primarily by $1.4 billion of subsidiary dividends, as well as the $550 million release of capital from unwinding MetLife Bank, as we mentioned at our May Investor Day. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. As you know, we report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the second quarter. With regards to Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 1,033% as of the first quarter of 2013. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the second quarter of 2013 were $614 million and $176 million, respectively. Statutory operating earnings were up $382 million from the prior year due to improved market conditions, while net income was lower than the prior year primarily due to derivative and joint venture capital losses. For the first 6 months of 2013, statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies were $1.4 billion and $734 million, respectively. Total adjusted capital for our domestic insurance companies is expected to be approximately $27.4 billion as of June 30, down 6% from December 31 primarily due to subsidiary dividends paid to the holding company. Excluding the dividends, total adjusted capital would have been down 1% for the year due to unrealized losses driven by derivatives. Finally, let me provide some comments regarding guidance. Considering the outperformance in the quarter and the first half of the year, we now expect to exceed the top end of our 2013 EPS guidance range of $4.95 to $5.35. We believe that our operating EPS will likely be lower in the second half of 2013 relative to the first half of 2013 primarily for 4 reasons: number one, we still anticipate investment spread compression for the balance of the year despite recent increase in interest rates due to our expectation for lower variable investment income and lower core yields; number two, we assume a less favorable market impact for the second half of the year; number three, we expect that surrenders in Japan will return to a more normal level in the second half of the year, which should mean a decline in surrender fee income relative to the first half of the year; and number four, we project higher expenses in the second half of the year, driven by key enterprise initiatives. Partially offsetting these items is the anticipated accretion from the acquisition of Provida, which is expected to close at the beginning of the fourth quarter. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne Agee.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Two questions, unrelated issues. The first is you talked and gave some good detail on the potential change in the -- from the pension reform in Poland. I was wondering if you could sort of give us an update on your expectations. There's been a lot of discussion about potential for reform in Chile, so maybe you can talk about your current business there and then the potential impacts on Provida.
Michel Khalaf: John, this is Michel Khalaf. Let me, first of all, just give you a little bit of the background around the proposed pension reform in Poland. Poland was one of the best performing economies in the EU following the financial crisis. However, the economy slowed down significantly in the last year, 18 months, so GDP growth is expected to be under 1% this year. In addition to that, Poland has 2 major challenges. One is around its debt-to-GDP ratio, which, under the Polish constitution, must be maintained under 55%, otherwise that would trigger austerity measures. And the other issue that Poland faces is that the EU requires it to have its budget deficit brought down to under 3%, and that budget deficit is currently close to 4%. So given this economic background, political situation with a government in its second term, facing elections in 2015, the Polish authorities are intending to introduce changes to the pension system, which is tantamount really to a partial renationalization of the system. But the situation at this point is quite unique in the sense that Poland is facing these challenges and hence, the proposed reforms. Obviously, we're disappointed at these developments. We think that in the long run, these measures will have detrimental effects, especially as far as the development of capital markets in Poland and as far as participants in the pension system as well. And we're working hard with the other participants in the market and industry and trade associations to hopefully convince the government to make some changes to those proposals. So that's a little bit of the background on Poland. Let me turn it over to Bill Wheeler to talk to you about Chile.
William J. Wheeler: Thanks, Michel. So John, a couple of things, just to give you a little context about Chile. Chile is a very attractive place to do business. It has a AA- sovereign credit rating. That's the highest in Latin America. It's -- and obviously, when we -- we took that into account when we announced the acquisition of Provida. Just remember, we think we bought Provida at a very attractive price relative to where other properties in that market have traded over the past couple of years. So it's a transaction that we're still very excited about. There is a presidential election campaign going on in Chile, so there have been some comments about the AFP pension scheme. Chile thinks they invented, and I guess they did invent, the private pension scheme 20-plus years ago. They're very proud of it. They think it's been a roaring success, and I don't disagree with that. The comments in the presidential election have come both from the contenders for the new job, as well as the existing president, Piñera. Michelle Bachelet, who is -- who was President of Chile previously and is now likely to be the winner in this coming election in November, has made some comments. And I would guess the comments are along the lines of she wants to see contributions increase, from sort of 10% of salary to maybe something like 12%. And also, she wants to make sure that workers at sort of lower socio-economic levels, sort of itinerant workers are covered more thoroughly by the existing pension schemes. I would also say she has talked about a lot of reforms in a lot of areas of the country, and so this is one of many things that she's focused on in her election campaigning. When we step back and think about what's been said and sort of her track record, remember, she had been president before so she's a known quantity, we're still very comfortable with the Provida acquisition and think it's going to be very successful for us.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: And then the second question I just had, John, you mentioned in Corporate Benefits Funding that it was really -- the investment margins expanded largely because of lower crediting rates related to capital markets-type business. Could you maybe give us more clarity there? Especially as it relates to -- is this a lower-level crediting rate that we should expect will continue? Or is it more tied to -- what is that tied to? Is it tied to LIBOR? Is it tied to rates at the longer end of the curve? Should those crediting rates jump back up?
John C. R. Hele: Right. Well, I would view this more as a onetime opportunistic, excellent management performance by our investment team really in the quarter. And also we've had good derivative income across all the lines. This line also benefited from some good returns we had on our sec lending program. So a lot of the assets that we've loaned out in the quarter were from this group, and we had slightly higher margins than we've had historically. So I would not put this for a full run rate. Steve will add a little bit to this, too, as well.
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: Let me just add a little color. It's Steve Goulart. And we like to think of it more than onetime, too, because a lot of it was really related to just what's happening in the capital markets. As we've been refinancing our funding agreement backed notes, obviously, those costs are coming down, and they're down substantially. If you look at what we refinanced in the first half of the year, in the order of $6 billion worth, it's down 100 to 150 basis points. And our asset yields are just not coming down as rapidly, so we're seeing good margins there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Couple of questions, first on cash. At $6.5 billion, even if we adjust for the Provida acquisition, it seems like cash is tracking a little bit at the high end of what you've guided for the end of year. So I want to see if maybe you had an update there.
John C. R. Hele: We're tracking within the range we gave you on Investor Day.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then on ROEs, I think, as of midyear, you're already in the 12.5% range. And thinking of previous guidance, which I think was 11% to 13% x any buybacks and probably 11%-ish if rates remain low, it seems like you're already exceeding that. So do you have any thoughts as to do ROEs -- or do they maintain at this level? Do you expect them to come down a bit? Maybe think about the next step of the ROE story.
John C. R. Hele: We've got a few impacts that will impact the future outlook for ROE. As we said, just on the call, that we expect the operating EPS to be -- operating earnings to be slightly lower than the first half of the year going forward. We also have our convertible equity units coming in this fall that will add to the denominator. And of course, we're building capital. We're not doing capital management actions at this time, and that will build up. So ROE will be pressured without other actions going forward, slowly over time. Contrary to this, will be our ability to grow revenues faster than our expenses, which the implementation of our strategy appears to be executing so far this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: First question for Steve Kandarian. First of all, thanks for the timeline on the whole regulatory outlook. It was helpful perspective. But if I take what you said and I think about the precedent that you mentioned, I guess, AIG and Pru sitting in Stage 3 for 7 months and then 30 to 60 days of incremental wait time and I couple that with your comments around -- in the past, around perhaps not doing anything more aggressive in terms of share repurchase until we actually know what the rules of the road are. So can I take from that, that as long as that time frame is out there, 7 months-plus, we're probably not going to see anything in terms of share repurchases?
Steven A. Kandarian: Suneet, what I've done in the past on this type of question is just simply say, "As of today, this is where we are" because things come down the pike over time that you learn more about the process or where things are going so you could change your point of view based upon new information. So I don't want to put a stake on the ground, but as of now, we don't think it's prudent to announce some large share buyback program in the face of the regulatory uncertainty that we have.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then, I guess, a second question on Japan. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the accident and health market there. Obviously, Aflac has announced a pretty big partnership with the Japan Post. And I'm wondering if that will somehow impact your -- I think, your target market, which I think is a little bit more direct-to-consumer marketing, which I would assume would be a little bit more in the rural areas. So I guess, how are you thinking about your growth potential in that market given that sizable transaction -- or sizable partnership that was announced?
Christopher G. Townsend: It's Chris Townsend. Let me tell you, first of all, in terms of how our A&H business grew in Japan for the second quarter. We grew at 10% year-on-year, and that was growth across all 4 channels, so across the career agency, independent agency, DM and the bank channel. So we have said to you a number of times before that the strength of our business in Japan emanates from the breadth of distribution we have, and that's being played out in the numbers you're seeing here. Interestingly enough, the bank channel, where we're challenged in terms of some of the fixed annuity business, we grew 73% year-on-year in the A&H channel, and we're selling A&H business to about 30 different banking partners now. So we feel we've got a good reach across the country and reach across distribution, which will allow us to continue to earn very good money out of the A&H business.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. So any comments on the Japan Post tie-up?
Christopher G. Townsend: The Japan Post business is an extension of an existing contract, which that company has, and it will, I'm sure, put them in good position for the cancer business. We -- our A&H business is slightly different to Aflac, and they're 80-20 cancer to medical. We're exactly vice versa in terms of 80% medical, 20% cancer. I would say that we actually launched today a new cancer product in Japan, which is fairly revolutionary in terms of some of the types it covers that it offers, and we're hoping for good things out of that product.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. Maybe one last question for Steve Kandarian, I guess. You've talked to us about the -- some of the initiatives that you've highlighted, the expense savings and the emerging markets. But the other one that we haven't really heard a whole lot about is the global group benefits initiative. So just wondering if there's any color that you can provide in terms of your progress there towards that, I think, $250 million of earnings by 2016.
Maria R. Morris: Suneet, it's Maria Morris. Thanks for the question. We're actually quite pleased with the progress we've been making in the group area across the globe. As you know, we are actually working with our global companies, and we've seen sales increased year-over-year by triple digits, which is phenomenal. We've seen our multinational sales up triple digits in each of the 3 regions. And our expatriate business continues to do well as well, where sales in expatriates will be up over 50% for the year.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Is it moving the needle yet in terms of earnings? Or is that still to come?
Maria R. Morris: We've been making some investments as you're aware of. We talked to you about those on Investor Day. So we're investing in the early years. We are seeing that we're above plan on earnings, but our earnings were more tempered in the early years as we invest for the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Crédit Suisse.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: First question for John, just in terms of the -- your comments about second half earnings drivers. On -- one of the things you mentioned, Japan surrenders you expect to fall off. Have you seen thus far into 3Q? I know we're a little -- we're what, 1 month into the quarter, but are you actually seeing that play out thus far? And then the other question on third quarter earnings would be you also mentioned you're assuming a lower variable investment income. Because of the lag on private equity reporting I assume you had pretty decent visibility on that. So should we be expecting something below plan or maybe middle of the plan in terms of near term where that trends? That's my first question, and then I have 1 follow-up.
John C. R. Hele: You asked 2 questions, but I'll give you that on 1. The second half earnings drivers with regards to Japan, yes, we've already seen a decrease, tapering down in that. So we do expect that to taper down for the remainder of the year. With regard to VII, we have -- some of the funds are on a 1-month lag, some is on a 1 quarter, so we're seeing it slightly less. But who knows what the equity market is going to do in August and September, and that's a key driver to these types of returns. So we're basically assuming on plan right now for -- which is the midpoint of the range we've given.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. Okay, so midpoint. And then just a question on long-term care, you'd mentioned the weakness in results as one issue for the quarter. Can you frame that a little bit? And are you still actually making money in long-term care even with the higher claims you're seeing? Is this an issue that we should be thinking about in terms of potential balance sheet impacts?
William J. Wheeler: Tom, it's Bill Wheeler. We make good money in long-term care. The issue with long-term care is that we have to hold a lot of capital against it, so the ROEs are not terribly attractive. But even with these incidence rates, long-term care is solidly profitable. A little color on the incidence. What we're seeing is higher reported claims, and the approval rate of those claims is pretty high. We're sort of digging into the issue now to make sure -- we recently moved some of the claims management and reporting and claims operations. And whenever you do that, in any insurance business, you always can -- sometimes new wrinkles can cause some blips in terms of how the claims management is done, so we're digging into that and trying to understand it better. But it's -- in my mind, this is a -- this did cause the non-health morbidity ratio to jump a little bit, but it's not that significant.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So Bill, still a lot of margin left?
William J. Wheeler: I'm sorry, what's that?
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: You still have a lot of margin left on the LTC.
William J. Wheeler: In terms of balance, this isn't -- wouldn't remotely size up to be a balance sheet issue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question for Steve, on capital deployment, you mentioned you'd -- probably the buybacks would be on hold until you get greater clarity on SIFI. Does that apply to dividends as well? Because you did raise your dividend despite uncertainty on SIFI. And then the other question is on just if you could give us a little bit more detail on the components of the derivatives losses. How much of those is related to interest rates, foreign exchange or the nonperformance risk?
John C. R. Hele: Jimmy, I'll take the dividend question. As you know, we just increased our dividend early this year by 49% from $0.74 a share to $1.10. And we announced the Provida acquisition for approximately $2 billion using cash on our balance sheet. So we are deploying capital in a way we think is prudent in light of the regulatory overhang. We don't think, at this point in time, engaging in share buybacks is the right thing to do. So that is kind of where we stand right now on deployment of capital. I don't rule out what happens late in the year in terms of changes to our dividend. But as of now, we're comfortable with $1.10 per year.
Steven A. Kandarian: With regard to the net derivative loss, it was about 60% rates, 20% FX and 20% own credit.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And the dividend, I wasn't assuming that you'd raise it right now anyway, but I think, in a couple of quarters, you're going to be at 4 quarters at a consistent rate. So -- but you are implying that the buyback comments won't necessarily apply to dividends though. Is that right?
Steven A. Kandarian: That's correct.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just following up on long-term care. Are you thinking about like raising prices on the in-force business? And if you are doing that, where you are in that process? And then finally, several of your competitors have actually had success with variable annuity buyouts. And wondering if you could just comment on your thoughts on part of your block that are perhaps a little bit more underwater.
William J. Wheeler: So Jimmy, this is Bill. The -- with regard to long-term care price increases, we've been raising prices on our long-term care in-force for, I think, 3 years now. We've sort of been going block by block in terms of doing that, and we've had very good success. We announced another round of price increases or the new initiatives at the end of 2012, and we are going through the state approval processes now. In our latest round of price increases, 25 states have granted us approval. Now before you get too excited, these tend to be a smaller populations states. The big population states, where most of the block is, are -- haven't opined yet. So they're -- but we think it's going well. And we actually, frankly, have a lot of experience in terms of getting these rate increases through the regulatory process, and this one is going in a very similar fashion to what's happened to us before. So that's sort of just latest on long-term care prices. We are looking at what some of our peers have done with regard to variable annuity buyouts. We're trying to analyze whether or not that makes sense for us. We haven't made a decision yet whether it does. Obviously, the reality is, if the stock market improves and interest rates move up, our in-force becomes less and less in the money. And our net amount of risk is a relatively small number, and their in the money-ness is a relatively small portion of the in-force block. So it's -- we haven't ruled it out, but we haven't made a decision yet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets.
Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I just have 1 question for Steve Kandarian. Steve, I was intrigued by your comments that you were focusing intensely on improving the customer service experience. That would seem to be a logical and normal thing for any business to do. It's just that in the life insurance business, I tend to think of it as having far fewer customer interactions than, say, the P&C business. In the car insurance business, for example, people's cars get in accidents, their homes are hurt by damage and they're looking for claims-paying ability. But on the life insurance business, I tend to think of it as a business in which people sign up and sort of maybe occasionally make changes to addresses and what have you, but don't have as many interactions as, say, in the property/casualty business. So why are you focusing on -- in what you call the customer experience as much as you do? And how will you know whether the expenditures are paying off? That's my 1 question.
Steven A. Kandarian: Eric, we've looked at a lot of studies around the issue of companies being customer-centric. And yes, P&C has more interaction than life, but we still have a fair number of interactions with our customers, even simple things like change of address or calling about some information on their product and their balances and so on and savings products. And if we don't provide a good customer experience in those interactions, people are not going to recommend us to family, friends, others who say, "I'm thinking about buying this product or that product that falls to the life insurance category. Who did you buy from? Did you have a good experience?" So the data is pretty clear that if you do a good job giving service to your customer, your top line improves because referrals, second sales and third sales to existing customers, as well as if you design the process right in terms of interactions and how the products themselves are sold and how the information that goes to customers is articulated, you'll get your cost down because all those customer complaints and second, third phone calls and trying to move people around the system to figure out an answer to their question becomes expensive. So again, the studies in these are pretty clear that your top line and bottom line can improve over time. It's not something that happens in the first 6 months or 12 months. It is a process that will take a number of years. We will track this. We will have data over time, but I don't have data for you right now. The cost that we're talking about here is not enormous amounts of money for some of the fixes that we're talking about. Simple fixes to websites to make them clearer, make the process much easier for the customer to interact with us are not big-ticket items. But it takes time and attention and takes a lot of people to focus on it. I used to hear when I was -- at MetLife, when I first got here, a mantra about customer service that's good enough. And I don't think that customer service that's good enough is good enough. I think you have to have good customer service, if you expect your existing customers to recommend you to others, if you expect that your ability to deliver customer service over time will be at a reasonable cost. So that's why we're engaged in this effort. It is something that we're all focused on, including all of us here at the executive group level, who make phone calls to customers who have problems with their interactions with us, where we can, on a firsthand basis, learn about those experiences and help us become more sensitized to what our customers face every day as they interact with us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein from Evercore.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Wanted to go to the, I guess, the derivative losses in the quarter. And I guess, the question I want to ask is this, obviously, rates going higher is a positive thing, but it does have that effect on earnings, both statutory and GAAP. And I guess what I'm thinking about is if you just take the assumption that rates will continue to migrate higher, perhaps follow the forward curve, if you will, who knows where they go, but how should we think about that in kind of future statutory dividends? Like, does it -- because, I mean, I'm really thinking about a nonparallel accounting treatment. Like, is this meaningful?
Steven A. Kandarian: Well, as we think -- our projections as we thought out to 2016 assume rates will be increasing. Our plan this year was the 10-year treasury go to 2.38%. We're in excess of that now but it will slowly be increasing. And we factor all this in when we think about our cash and capital projections, when we give you the ratios that we spoke about on Investor Day. So I mean we do take this into account. You have to remember that there is -- we generally have longer-dated derivatives, so it's more tied to the longer end of the curve. Today, we still have very short-term rates, very low short-term rates. And I think as people think forward over the next few years, that's where some of the more interesting pressure might come, if the curve flattened some more. So there's really 2 dimensions to the whole rising interest rate.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, I guess, I think you pointed out some key enterprise initiatives in the back half of the year as a driver of higher expenses. I know there's been a lot going on with the company, but you highlighted this specifically in the back half of the year. Is there anything specific that we should be thinking about that you can talk about?
John C. R. Hele: We have some of the -- as we spoke about at our Investor Day in terms of the cost saves, we also have some strategic expenses coming through. They've been fairly light so far, but they will be building throughout the remainder of the year. And that's one of the aspects of the large investments in technology, much related around to improving customer service, as Steve mentioned.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just finally, just thinking about variable annuity -- or I should say annuity earnings. I know you had very wide fixed annuity spreads, but you had a substantial gapping up of the kind of the ROAs on the block. And I'm just thinking -- I mean, are we at a new basing level, if you just kind of back off some spread on fixed annuities? But just thinking about the level of annuity earnings. I mean, are we at a new basing level that we should be trending going forward off of?
John C. R. Hele: I wouldn't trend it off as high as what we have done this quarter because of the factors that I mentioned. We are reinvesting as those annuities mature, and the cash flows turn over in that business. We're investing at a lower rate than what we have historically. The derivative income has held up very well. The investment teams have been able to keep those -- that derivative income up, and that's been one of the big outperforms versus our expectations in the core spread. We also had good VII that's allocated to that line of business. So you have to put that piece down. You also remember, we've had very favorable equity markets in general in the annuity business, and that drives -- we have larger assets from that, so we get more fee income from that business line flowing through. So the higher asset base and depending upon your views of equity market performance, that will re-base higher, obviously. But this is pressure of the reinvestment narrowing down.
Steven A. Kandarian: Okay. Well, we're at 9:00, so we're going to need to end the call. Thank you very much for your interest in MetLife.

MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Edward A. Spehar: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings press release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of the Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I know that capital management is of great interest to our investors, and I trust you saw last week's announcement of a 49% increase in our common stock dividend, the first increase since 2007. Our new dividend results in a payout ratio of approximately 20%, which is in line with our peers. The dividend increase, as well as our plan to internally fund the $2 billion acquisition of AFP Provida, illustrates our commitment to making effective use of capital. Nevertheless, given prevailing regulatory uncertainty, we continue to assume no share repurchases in our 2013 plan. Turning to our quarterly results. We are pleased to report that the year is off to a good start. The first quarter 2013 operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 12% over the first quarter of 2012. Operating earnings per share were $1.48, an 8% increase over the prior year period. And operating return on equity was 12.7% on an annualized basis. Our operating earnings were aided by strong equity markets, favorable investment margins and good performance on expenses. Net income for the quarter was $956 million. The difference between net and operating income is primarily explained by derivative losses related to asymmetrical accounting treatment and noneconomic factors. The first quarter included $411 million of after-tax derivative losses from economic hedges, where the associated risk does not have the same GAAP accounting treatment, as well as $269 million of after-tax derivative losses related to MetLife's own credit spread. John Hele will discuss our financial results in further detail in a few minutes. As I said on our December guidance call, MetLife faces external headwinds that we cannot control, such as low interest rates and regulatory uncertainty. However, we are focusing on mitigating the impact of these headwinds and executing our strategy in the areas we can control to create shareholder value. A good example of this is our effort to reduce expenses. We have said that the bulk of our expense saving opportunities are in the U.S., and our results reflect solid progress in this market, with total fixed operating expenses down 3% year-over-year. We are extremely pleased with this performance, especially considering that premiums, fees and other revenues in the U.S. were up 4% year-over-year and up 5% excluding pension closeouts. This expense margin improvement contributes $0.05 to earnings per share on a year-over-year basis. Expenses will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but it's clear that our cost-saving initiatives are translating to improve bottom line results. Going forward, we remain focused on achieving the full $600 million of annual pretax net expense savings discussed at our May 2012 Investor Day. The consolidation of our U.S. real estate footprint announced in March is an example of these efforts. By moving 2,600 retail and technology jobs to North Carolina, we are reducing labor and real estate costs, enabling better employee collaboration and driving efficiencies. Sales growth in emerging markets is another area of strategic focus to drive shareholder value. First quarter results showed continued momentum on a year-over-year basis, with sales in Latin America up 20% and sales in the emerging economies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa up 40%, driven by strong results in the Gulf, Turkey and Russia. The sales increase in emerging markets, combined with a 29% decline in U.S. variable annuity sales in the quarter, reflects substantial progress on our efforts to shift our business mix away from capital-intensive, market-sensitive products. We remain on track to sell $10 billion to $11 billion of variable annuities this year, which will be a decline of approximately 40% from last year. Now let me turn to the current interest rate environment. With the 10-year Treasury yield falling back to below 1.7% and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield at less than 60 basis points, we recognize that investors and analysts are concerned about the potential impact of low rates on our business. However, our analysis suggests that a sustained low-rate environment is a manageable risk. The current rate environment in the U.S. is very similar to the interest rate stress scenario discussed in our 2012 10-K filing, which assumes, among other things, a 1.69% 10-year Treasury through the end of 2014. Based upon these assumptions, operating earnings per share would decrease by $0.04 in 2013 and $0.13 in 2014. In addition, we see incremental earnings risk if rates remain at current levels in Japan, but the estimated impact would be immaterial this year and less than $0.05 per share in 2014. Next, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the regulatory environment. MetLife faces the possibility of being named a nonbank, systemically important financial institution, or SIFI, which would place us under Federal Reserve supervision. To date, MetLife has not been notified by the Financial Stability Oversight Council that we have been moved to Stage 3 of the process for designating SIFIs, although the conventional wisdom holds that we will be at some point. That is why I am spending time in Washington, participating in the debate on this important issue. At a speech delivered at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce last month, I stated that the traditional business of life insurance does not present systemic risk to the U.S. economy and that MetLife should not be named a SIFI. My 3 main points were: one, the life insurance business did not cause the financial crisis; imposing bank centric regulations on certain life insurance companies, however well-intentioned, would negatively affect the availability and affordability of financial protection for consumers; and three, there's a better way for the federal government to regulate potentially systemic activities in the life insurance sector. Rather than name a handful of life insurance companies as SIFIs, regulators should target those activities that caused the financial crisis in the first place. The Dodd-Frank Act defined a SIFI as a company whose failure could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United states. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, clarified that such a threat only exists if there would be an impairment of financial market functioning that would be sufficiently severe to inflict significant damage on the broader economy. There is no evidence that any traditional life insurance company is sufficiently interconnected with the rest of the financial system to meet that test. To be clear, I am not suggesting that MetLife could never fail. What I am suggesting is that we cannot think of a single firm that would be brought down by its exposure to MetLife. For example, in our derivatives book, counter-party exposure to MetLife, net of collateral, is insignificant as a percentage of counter-party total capital. The average exposure in the event of a MetLife default is 0.25% of a derivatives dealer's total capital. The largest exposure is 0.75% of total capital, simply not large enough to create systemic risk. An approach that focuses on activities is more likely to capture systemic risk, regardless of the size of the firm. An activities-based approach is also consistent with how regulation of a life insurance business is evolving internationally. I am encouraged by the willingness of regulators and policymakers to listen to these perspectives and engage in a dialogue about these critical issues. My hope is that regulators will take into account the fundamental differences between banks and insurance companies as the prudential rules for nonbank SIFIs are being finalized. In closing, we are focused on executing our strategy to create sustained value for shareholders over time. Our strong first quarter earnings had a meaningful increase on our common stock dividend illustrate our ability to manage through external challenges. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail.
John C. R. Hele: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion on insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash, capital and guidance. To begin, MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.6 billion or $1.48 per share, up 12% year-over-year. This quarter included 2 notable items. The first was in our retail annuities business. We had a nonrecurring benefit related to our assumption review for variable annuities, and some of the models required adjustment to reflect the full impact of the lower lapse rates. This increased operating earnings by $29 million after tax or $0.03 per share. Second, pretax variable investment income was $337 million, reflecting strong private equity returns and higher bond prepayments. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $217 million, which was $22 million or $0.02 per share above the top end of our 2013 quarterly guidance range. Turning to our bottom line results. First quarter net income was $956 million or $0.87 per share and included net derivative losses of $410 million after tax. As Steve mentioned, the net derivative losses in the quarter included a $680 million after-tax loss, which is explained by 3 items: one, the tightening of Met's own credit spread; two, changes in currency rates, driven principally by the weakening of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar; and three, an increase in interest rates. These factors were partially offset by favorable VA hedge performance, favorable market conditions and changes in the in-force. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $47.37 at March 31, up 2% year-over-year. Turning to margins. Underwriting in the U.S. was generally unfavorable this quarter. The mortality ratio in retail life was 92.7% due to unfavorable experience in both VUL [ph] and traditional life. This result was higher than the target range, which is in the mid-80s, and slightly worse than the 91.6% ratio in the first quarter of 2012. The mortality ratio in group life was 91.3% in the quarter, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 89.1% and above the target range of 85% to 90%. The increase in the mortality ratio was driven by more term claims and a higher average term life death benefit. To give you a better sense of the earning sensitivity for retail life mortality, a 1-percentage-point change in the mortality ratio equates to quarterly operating earnings impact of approximately $2 million to $3 million. For group life, a 1-percentage-point change in the loss ratio equates to quarterly operating earnings impact of approximately $8 million to $10 million. The group health benefit ratio was 88.9%, up 140 points from the prior year quarter of 87.5% but within the targeted range of 86% to 90%. A 1-percentage-point change in the loss ratio equates to operating earnings impact of approximately $10 million on a quarterly basis. Next, let me discuss investment spreads. In our QFS, we now provide spreads, including and excluding the variable investment income. You will note that spreads remained healthy across all major product lines in the U.S., although we did see some modest year-over-year tightening in deferred annuities and corporate benefit funding. Overall, investment spreads were better than planned in the first quarter. However, we do anticipate that investment spreads will decline for the full year, but the earnings risk is relatively modest in 2013 and 2014 even if interest rates stay at current levels in the U.S. and Japan. Turning to expenses. The operating expense ratio was 23.9% for the first quarter. Excluding the impact of pension and post-retirement benefits and closeouts, the operating expense ratio was 23.2%. This compares favorably to the first quarter of 2012, which had an operating expense ratio of 24.9% and 24.3% excluding pension and post-retirement benefits and closeouts. We are pleased with this performance as it reflects progress on our strategic goal to reduce net expenses by $600 million. However, results also benefited somewhat from the timing of expenses. I will now discuss some of the business highlights in the quarter. Rather than go through every segment, I will focus on areas where our results may have differed from your expectations. Therefore, my comments will be on Retail, Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, Asia and EMEA. Retail reported operating earnings of $626 million, a year-over-year increase of 33%. Normalized operating earnings were $581 million, after accounting for previously mentioned nonrecurring VA lapse adjustment of $29 million and variable investment income that was $16 million higher than planned. This variable investment income was about $3 million in retail annuities and $13 million in retail life and other. On a normalized basis, retail operating earnings were up 17% versus the first quarter of 2012 due to higher net investment income, lower ongoing DAC amortization annuities and lower operating expenses. These positive items were partially offset by unfavorable underwriting results in life. Normalized operating earnings for retail annuities were $340 million, an increase of 21% from the prior year quarter. Growth was driven by favorable ongoing DAC amortization and lower expenses. We do not normalize for variances in separate account returns. And earnings and retail annuities were $33 million higher than planned, as a result of strong stock market performance in the quarter. As a forward-looking rule of thumb, a 1-percentage-point change in the S&P 500 equates to approximately $1 million to $3 million of operating earnings in the current quarter and roughly $5 million of operating earnings in the next 12 months. These are just rules of thumb, and actual results will vary based on the equity bond mix in the separate accounts and the performance of other indices. Due to these factors, the market impact this quarter went slightly higher than the forward-looking rule of thumb. This was a good quarter for retail annuities, with normalized operating earnings higher than planned by approximately $80 million. However, the results in the quarter benefited from items that may not occur in future quarters, and we continue to expect investment spread compression. Normalized operating earnings for retail, life and other were $241 million, an increase of 13% from the prior year. Earnings were as expected despite worse-than-expected mortality, as both investment margins and expenses were favorable. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $230 million, down 5% year-over-year. After adjusting for normalizing items in both periods, which included variable investment income that was $4 million below plan in this quarter, normalized operating earnings were down 1% year-over-year. Higher interest margins, expense management and favorable underwriting in the dental business were more than offset by lower underwriting results in group life and long-term care. In long-term care, the benefit ratio was higher than planned due to higher incidence and reserve adjustments. Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $333 million in the quarter, up 11% year-over-year and 12% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for normalized items in both periods, which included variable investment income of $10 million above planned this quarter, normalized operating earnings were up 12% from the prior year quarter. This was due to higher fee income from the surrender of certain fixed annuity products in Japan and an increase in net investment income. The higher surrenders were largely the result of customers harvesting gains in foreign currency-denominated fixed annuity products, primarily those in Australian dollars. We believe the intent was to shift assets into equities as a result of the strong performance of the nick high [ph] and the topics, the early indication that surrenders will remain elevated in the second quarter. Although we are only normalizing for variable investment income, it is important to note that the first quarter results may not be indicative of future quarters earnings. First, excess surrenders added $29 million after tax, and we assume that surrender activity will normalize eventually, plus there is lost earnings associated with these surrenders; second, there was a $10 million after-tax benefit from a loan repayment; third, the initial impact from the strong equity market in Japan at an $8 million after tax; finally, currency weakness could be a bigger negative in future quarters. As we have stated previously, we have hedges for our 2013 projected yen-exposed operating earnings at strike prices at around JPY 90 to the U.S. dollar. These hedges are currency options which provide protection against the yen weakening beyond JPY 90 but allow us to participate in the upside should the yen strengthen. Our protection now extends in the first half of 2014, with currency options at around JPY 90 in place for the first quarter 2014 and at around JPY 95 for the second quarter 2014. Let me reiterate that we still believe the low end of our 2013 operating earnings guidance for Asia is a realistic expectation, even though our plan assumes a yen-dollar exchange rate of slightly less than JPY 82. I'd like to close in Asia with a few comments on sales. Our first quarter sales were down 13% year-over-year and below our plan largely because of the weakness in bank channel sales. In Japan, our sales through banks were down 60% on a year-over-year basis. We are willing to trade business volume for business value as we remain disciplined on pricing. Finally, EMEA had strong operating earnings of $87 million in the first quarter, up 21% year-over-year and 17% on a constant currency basis. The fundamental strength in the first quarter was driven by credit insurance in Russia, group medical in the Gulf and lower expenses. But there are also a couple of onetime favorable items related to Greece. These items were material for the segment but not the overall company. I'd like to comment on a topic that I know is of great interest to our investors: cash. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.8 billion at the end of the first quarter, which is down from year-end but consistent with our plan given the anticipated timing of subsidiary dividends and holding company expenses. Moving to our capital position, the combined RBC ratio for our principally U.S. insurance companies, excluding ALICO, at year-end 2012 was 466%. Also, as of December 31, 2012, our Japan solvency margin ratio was 909%. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the first quarter of 2013 was $793 million and $558 million, respectively. These results are lower than the prior year due to less favorable market conditions and underwriting. Our total adjusted capital is expected to approximately be $29.5 billion at the end of the first quarter 2013, up 1% from December 31. Let me conclude by reiterating Steve's comment that the first quarter was a good start to 2013. By considering the outperformance in the quarter, we are comfortable with the top end of our 2013 EPS guidance range of $4.95 to $5.35. To help you think about the quarterly EPS run rate, we would suggest you consider a few things. Normalizing items aided first quarter operating EPS by $0.05. The excess of the initial earnings impact from the strong equity market relatively ongoing benefit added about $0.05 to first quarter EPS. The anticipated decline in our investment margins, even with the interest rate increase we assume in our plan, is expected to reduce quarterly EPS by more than $0.05 on average. The timing of expenses added a couple of pennies per share to the earnings in the first quarter mostly outside of the U.S. Also, you should assume that the unfavorable impact from the yen weakness for the remainder of the year and some normalization of surrender activity in Japan may be largely offset by the accretion from the acquisition of Provida, which is expected to close in the third quarter. Finally, we don't believe it's prudent practice to provide full year guidance on a quarterly basis, especially after only one quarter. And with that, I will turn it back to Ed.
Edward A. Spehar: Thank you, John. Before we start Q&A, [Operator Instructions]. With that, Greg, if we could please take the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I wanted to start with Steve, if I could. Yes, I thought your comments around the presentation you made in Washington were helpful. Could you provide any color on how the response has been and what the feedback was?
Steven A. Kandarian: Yes, indeed. I would say that the policymakers, people in the Hill, others in Washington are listening carefully to the arguments. There is a lot of debate going on. I think it's healthy. I think having these views on the table is important to make sure we get it right. This is an important industry. It affects millions of Americans across our country. And it's just really important that these financial protection products are still going to be available and affordable to people going forward, especially at a time when the social safety net's under a lot of pressure in our country. So I think people are being very thoughtful about the discussion, are listening carefully, and I'm hopeful that when things finally transpire here, that we'll get a solution that makes sense.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And anything on the timing of when things may transpire?
Steven A. Kandarian: We don't have any clarity on that, Suneet. Having statements coming out of FSOC that they think that the first designations of nonbank SIFIs will be coming, and the word they used was soon. But obviously, that word doesn't have really a great deal of specificity to it. So we have to wait and see how that sorts out.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got it. And then just a follow-up for John, if I could, on the holding company cash. I think you said $4.8 billion, down a little bit from year-end. If we think back to that cash flow roll-forward that you provided in December, and I know you had some items in there that were like placeholders, for example, the Dodd-Frank collateral. I'm not sure if we had real clarity on what the run rate holding company expenses were. But just sort of big picture, is that cash flow roll-forward pretty much the same based on where you sit today? Or has there been any changes to it other than the dividend, I understand that.
John C. R. Hele: Sure. The -- in the $4.8 billion is where we plan to be given the timing of our expenses and sub-dividends, how we get them in the flows in and out. We did have a placeholder, as we mentioned, for Dodd-Frank derivative collateral rules. Those are still a bit influx. The original rules that were specified last year in the U.S. were somewhat onerous. However, the international rules had a longer phase-in period and were not as onerous. There's still a discussion going on between which ones are going to be adopted. I believe they're leaning very much on the international, less onerous rules with a longer phase-in period. But for now, we're going to keep the placeholder in, and we'll have to see how things develop throughout the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Crédit Suisse.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: First question is, of the $600 million of cost saves that you're targeting, can you tell us where you're at on that? How much is in this quarter's run rate to date, and how much is still on the come-through? I think, Steve, you guys had said the $600 million should be realized by the end of '14. How much is still to come on that?
John C. R. Hele: We've gotten net, and this is mainly heading to the U.S. There's about $115 million, but we have some onetime costs of about $40 million. So the net to the bottom line is about $75 million.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And John, is that $75 million per quarter is hitting the bottom line right now?
John C. R. Hele: Yes.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. So you're not -- sorry, go ahead.
John C. R. Hele: So it's really $115 million, but there's a onetime cost of $40 million.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And you're not stripping out that one -- or are you stripping out that onetime cost from operating?
John C. R. Hele: No. No, it's included.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. Okay. So -- and that would be restructuring cost, I presume?
Steven A. Kandarian: Yes.
John C. R. Hele: Now the -- yes, some -- but some of our reinvestment, yes, the $600 million is a net number. So we plan to get to $1 billion with a $400 million reinvest over time when we get out there. So the -- we'll start to have some more reinvest heading then in future periods as well.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So should I view that, that you guys are more than half of the way there? Should I be netting that against the full year $600 million pretax number? Or should I be netting that against $1 billion? I just want understand how you're thinking about that $115 million in the context of your goal.
John C. R. Hele: Yes, I'd say we're about halfway there, maybe 1/3 to 1/2. The reinvestment timing is still going to be phased in, but we've made good progress here.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And then the -- my follow-up is I just want to understand the yen sensitivity a little bit better at a higher level. Can you tell us what percent of your Asia earnings are actually Japan because, obviously, Korea is a pretty big contributor. So I want understand, of the $330 million, how much is Japan? And of the Japan, how much are yen-denominated earnings versus U.S. dollar-denominated earnings?
Christopher G. Townsend: Let me wait in that. It's Chris Townsend. Let me just wait in and give you the number in terms of the Japan proportion of the $333 million. The Japan earnings, overall, for the quarter of $303 million part of $333 million, and I think we're about 65% yen-based earnings on that.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Chris, that's 65% yen-based of the $303 million?
Christopher G. Townsend: That's correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.
Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: With capital, it's good to see the dividend increase last week. With buybacks, I know said your plan doesn't include any buybacks for this year. That said, you do have the dilutive equity units coming up later this year. Should we take it from your comments that offsetting the impact of those units is off the table? Or is that something you could still consider over the course of the year? Also, I know you noticed that currently, you didn't need the approval from the Fed. But would it be correct to assume that you did consult with them before going ahead with the dividend rates?
Steven A. Kandarian: Nigel, we think a strong dividend and buybacks are both important to our shareholders. Those are 2 goals of ours going forward. As you've seen, we've increased our dividend by 49% for the second quarter and going forward. And we've also mentioned today that there are no buybacks planned in 2013. That's what we're working with as an assumption. Clearly, the regulatory environment is a key factor in terms of what we do in regard to buybacks, and we're waiting for more clarity around that topic right now. So I think it's as prudent on our part to take a wait-and-see attitude around how the regulations sorts out here over the course of the year before we make commitments about buybacks.
Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And with the dividends, did you actually talk to -- with the Fed?
Steven A. Kandarian: No. In terms of talking to the Fed, as you know, we sold our bank in January. We legally de-banked in February. We're no longer regulated by the Federal Reserve. It wouldn't be appropriate for us to go to them at this point in time, although I'll tell you that, certainly, we went through the stress test exercise in late 2011, early 2012. We had $1.10 dividend request in that test, and we already made that public. Back in 2012, we made that public. So the Fed certainly is aware of our desire to have $1.10 dividend.
Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then just a second, with annuities, as you mentioned, you had a positive impact this quarter from lower lapses on your DAC for variable annuities. I guess my concern is that lower lapses can actually be a sizable problem for guaranteed minimum income benefit products. Accordingly, can you discuss what sort of lapse assumptions you're seeing in your statutory accounting for variable annuities and how that compares to the lapse activity that you're currently seeing?
John C. R. Hele: Well, the -- this is John. The lapse assumptions are consistent with what we communicated at the last quarter in terms of the changes to the lapse functions. We had a slight model refinement in the calculating of the impact on operating earnings. It had no impact below the line and statutory assumptions are the same as we used for GAAP.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America.
Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a question on the pace of VA sales. I know $3.5 billion is probably a little bit outsized considering that you still have the old product for the first month. Could give us a sense of old product versus new products mix between that $3.5 billion?
William J. Wheeler: Yes, most of the first quarter sales were old product because even if they actually stop taking new apps, there was a lot of throughput that got processed ultimately through the quarters. So most was old product. The old products, by the way, still had an attractive ROI this quarter because, obviously, hedging costs have come down. But now, new -- sales for the remainder of the 9 months should be all GMIB Max V, the new product. And in terms of our ability to hit our run rate, we're currently tracking at a weekly sales rate that we think we'll still be able to hit that sales goal comfortably.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I had a question. You mentioned -- on interest rates, you mentioned the EPS impact of lower rates through 2014. Could you talk about potential for DAC or reserve charges over the next few years if rates remain at these levels, especially in products like long-term care? And then also how should the impact of lower rates compound beyond 2014 if we're sort of in this environment for more than a year or so?
William J. Wheeler: Jimmy, it is Bill Wheeler. With regard to long-term care, a couple things to keep in mind, that we've added to statutory reserves over a long period of time, which is, of course, where any likely reserve impact would be. It would be a long ways away from GAAP adjustments. The -- and I think we feel that with regard to what we're doing, with regard to long-term care in terms of price increases, as well as on the in-force, as well as the fact that we've really built up reserves over time prudently, make us feel that the likelihood of adjustments even with the low [ph] level of interest rates is pretty low.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And that goes for other products as well?
John C. R. Hele: Yes, so we have given you some guidance here. Steve gave you some operating earnings sensitivities to lower rates. We still have a meaner version assumptions on very long-term contracts that do gear up over time, and we are comfortable with that now and are comfortable for the foreseeable future. We still have the Federal Reserve doing extensive bond-buying in the markets. We're not certainly in normal situations. I think we have to wait and see for some period of time how that would resolve, and we would rethink about our long-term assumptions. But for now and for '13, certainly, and going into '14, we're comfortable with our long-term assumptions, which is what drives the GAAP and DAC.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: But you'd review on like -- and then you're assuming a slight increase in rates over time and it does not materialize over the first -- or it has an extended period of low rates than you just look at those on an annual basis, I guess?
John C. R. Hele: We kind of look at this -- we look at this on an annual basis because we have very long-term contracts. Long-term care is probably the longest of the liabilities, so we have long liabilities. The pension business, the life insurance is all very long-term liabilities, and you have to really think carefully about how you set these long-term assumptions given we're still in the aftermath of '08, with a lot of activity by federal governments looking at and working on interest rates. So we will take it year by year and think it through carefully.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then just on SIFI, have you done any internal studies that would just assess what the -- what your balance sheet would look like if it was subjected to like a Basel-type capital standards? Because just if you do a big picture analysis, it seems like as the insurance companies were subjected to bank-based standards, they would be significantly short on capital. Is that a correct assessment?
Steven A. Kandarian: Jimmy, it's Steve. The questions of being what Basel standards, and we've heard from officials in Washington, is it going to be Basel I for insurance companies? Will it be some other form of Basel? Will it not be Basel? It's really very much up in the air right now, and that's why we continue to make the argument in Washington that whatever rules come forward for nonbank SIFIs should be tailored to the industry they're regulating and not relate to a bank or bank-like approach for regulation.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes, but under Basel III, the insurance companies' statements that have just given the capital charges on the various investments seems like the large insurance companies, if they are subjected to SIFI, they would be significantly undercapitalized. I don't know if you've done an analysis of that internally.
Steven A. Kandarian: A straight Basel 3 regime, it would be a very difficult capital regime for us to operate under. There's no question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne Agee.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I have a question on Japan sales. I think, John, that you mentioned that sales were down about 13% year-over-year, but that was driven heavily, I guess, by the bank channel, which was down 60. I was wondering if maybe -- whether you or Chris could give us maybe a little bit more of a breakdown. I'm unclear on what percentage of overall Japan sales actually come through the bank channel and maybe what some of the third sector and non-single premium whole life sales, what kind of growth rates were you seeing there?
Christopher G. Townsend: Okay. Let me have a shot at this. First of all, the bank business overall in Japan makes up about 15% to 20% of the total AMB for Japan. Of that, the fixed annuity foreign currency product that John referenced make up about 50% of the total there. So overall, we've seen that bank channel down 60%. So a rather significant reduction. And I think in terms of the surrenders you're seeing that John referenced, you'll see those continue for all the way through the second quarter. And we expect the channel -- the bank channel to be down about 30% to 35% for the full year. In terms of the A&H business, we're down 6% for the quarter, which is in line with the market. And we expect to be flat on A&H overall for the year. So with all of these moving parts, we would expect sales in Japan probably to be flat year-on-year. And overall, for Asia, given all the other countries you got in the region, we expect sales, the AMB number for the year to be about 5% up year-on-year. I would just caution you in terms of the bank sales. The -- a good portion of our earnings in Japan come predominantly from the A&H business and second from the life business, which are in reasonably good shape. And the big benefit of what we got there is the bundling capability on the A& H, where we intend to get about 60% to 65% of the life sales bundled with an A&H product, which gives us a good edge in that market overall.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: That's very helpful. And then I guess, just thinking about interest rates a little bit more, I was wondering if you could give us some sense for how much portfolio overall turnover you're expecting this year and next?
William J. Wheeler: Well, I don't know that we've historically talked about portfolio turnover a lot, John. But I think our activities, we make projections on what we expect. I think the first quarter, we probably had a little more portfolio turnover than normal just given the rate environment and some of the [indiscernible] and interest rates and the like. But overall, if we look at -- historically, we look at the last several quarters, I mean, our turnover is pretty much in line with what we see for typical industry statistics.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: And then just real quick, any sort of outlook commentary you can provide with respect to variable investment income for the remainder of the year? I mean, you've got a pretty wide quarterly range and always want to be careful about trying to model all the way at the upper end of the range, which is what you adjust against. But any commentary there would be helpful.
William J. Wheeler: Sure. Again, there is a reasonable correlation between equity market performance and a good portion of our variable investment income, so you have to take into consideration what happened in the first quarter. We saw a very strong equity market, so I think, certainly, the near term, meaning the second quarter have to be strong. And as we look forward for the rest of the year, we're not projecting necessarily continued -- the continued same performance in the markets. So we're back probably comfortable with the plan. And overall, I think that means we are -- we feel very comfortable with the VII plan right now. We probably think we'll be closer towards the top of the plan. But obviously, anything can happen in the second half of the year.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: And then, Steve, just around that. A lot of private equity firms, the distributions are quite elevated and appear to be -- it appears that it's going to remain that way. Are you reinvesting such that we ought to expect private equity investments in total to remain relatively stable as we look forward?
William J. Wheeler: Yes. Yes, we have ongoing commitments to private equity. We like the sector, and we'll continue to at least maintain our investment level.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein from Evercore Partners.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Can you just talk about the strategy on hedging the yen in Japan and maybe just give thoughts on an endgame? I mean, you obviously kind of layered into the first quarter of '14, you layered into the second quarter of '14 at JPY 95. Where do you expect to get to and what is kind of the longer-term strategy?
John C. R. Hele: Right. This is John, Mark. Currency is always an interesting thing to think about. We have decided, we take it quarter-by-quarter. We meet and decide, do we want to take a position on the yen or not? We did so far with input from our investment group and thinking about our business there. But again, it is a quarter-to-quarter plan for us in terms of how we think about it. And we've got the protection that we've told you about.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I guess would you expect to kind of build hedges that get you through '14 based on kind of current conversations?
John C. R. Hele: We haven't decided.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just, I guess, a follow-up question on Asia earnings and just thinking about the higher lapses, maybe going back to kind of -- I think it was Nadel's [ph] question. The -- should we infer from the commentary that the higher lapses that you've seen and that you are going to continue to see into to see into this quarter are not material to the overall earnings? Or should we be thinking about an earnings strain? And if so, how much?
Christopher G. Townsend: It's Chris Townsend, again. Let me -- I guess the way you should think about this overall is that the surrender fees we're getting -- or the surrender penalties we're getting at the moment are the net of DAC and variable amortization in the market value adjustment. So that $29 million you've got in the first quarter is effectively a prepayment to the profit for the life of the contract. So what you're seeing is, economically, we're being made whole for our profit. If the contract just stayed in place, you'd probably see those earnings spread over, over the life of the -- probably, it's around 7 years, the average amount of the contract. So I think for the first 2 quarters of the year, what you'd expect to see is earnings deficiency of about $2 million to $3 million per quarter for the life of the 7 years of the contract.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then I guess just would you expect the second quarter to kind of look like the first quarter in terms of that $29 million?
Christopher G. Townsend: We would. As I said before, we'd expect the same sort of surrender fee income at the moment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Giovanni from Goldman Sachs.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess first question regarding the Provida transaction. So one of your competitors did a large-claim pension deal, pointing to better-than-expected earnings partly attributable to more customers that actually stayed in the plan post the deal announcement than what was expected. So I'm curious if you can provide any insight around what you're seeing in terms of retention since the deal was announced,
William J. Wheeler: Chris, it's Bill Wheeler. So remember, we won't close until sometime in the third quarter. That's our expectation. And I would tell you, I think Provida's performance in the first -- for the first part of this year has been right on track. And in terms of profitability and ongoing business, I haven't seen a fluctuation one way or another. So it's looking good.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then I guess regarding VA policyholder behavior, there's certainly a lot of focus around lapse assumptions. But I wanted to ask about sort of annuitization trends. So your GMIB product, I guess, it's really at a point where you're likely starting to see some policyholder behavior trends on annuitization take-ups. So I wanted to see if you can comment on those trends sort of relative to maybe your original expectations and then your current assumptions for reserves.
William J. Wheeler: Yes, sure. My guess is we'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but I'll give you some sense of what we're doing. A very small portion of our GMIB block is available to be annuitized today, so I think roughly 5%, maybe even a little less than that. So there's not a lot of data yet on the experience in terms of people deciding to annuitize. That said, the level of annuitizations right now is very low, and even for even for products that are in the money, they -- so we're seeing a quite low level of annuitizations. But I think we haven't decided to react to that yet because it's very early days and not many people have had the opportunity to annuitize yet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Macquarie.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research: Just getting back to the policyholder surrenders in Japan. I'm just wondering, if the yen is weakening, why the policyholders would want to give up their exposure to policies denominated in foreign currencies?
Christopher G. Townsend: Yes, what we're seeing there is the people are taking advantage of the significant rise in the equity markets in Japan and lock it in some of the foreign currency gains. So you've seen all of these [ph], that most of them, it's about 60/40 in terms of Australian dollar versus U.S. dollars, the mix of these fixed annuities. But it's effectively taking the benefit and putting it into mutual funds in the equity markets.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then just is there any color on what's driving the sales growth in Latin America? You call out Mexico in direct marketing. Is there anything to note there?
Steven A. Kandarian: No. It's very consistent with our plan in terms of 20-plus percent sales growth year-over-year. That was our expectation. Look, we're -- and a lot of that is driven by direct marketing, but it's really coming in a lot of areas of the business as well.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz from Raymond James.
Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I want to follow up on -- I think it was Chris' question. Bill, while you haven't seen a whole lot of annuitization yet, have you seen any changes in the usage of dollar-for-dollar withdrawals on the GMIB?
William J. Wheeler: No. But we -- when we designed the product, we assumed that there would be a certain level of dollar-for-dollar usage, and there is, and it has not changed. Remember, though, that now in the new products, the -- or the new GMIB, the dollar-for-dollar benefit, though it still exists, is much less attractive.
Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, Steve, if I can follow up in your discussion about the dividend, were you saying that you had basically run through the current dividend through the CCAR test that the Fed found you deficient on?
Steven A. Kandarian: No. That -- that's not what I was saying. I was asked a question earlier if we informed the Fed or ran by the Fed our decision to raise the dividend to $1.10 before announcing that. So I said was because we're no longer regulated by the Fed, it would be inappropriate for us to go them seeking approval or something of that nature. But I noted that when we went through the stress test, that was our -- part of our submission was having $1.10 dividend. So they're certainly aware of our desire to raise the dividend to $1.10 for the common shareholder.
Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Got it. And then one more, if I may. There was a -- I think, there was a reference to a yen loss -- a currency exchange loss, and I think it was the yen, with regards to net investment income. Is this akin to what prudential has reflected over the last couple of quarters with liabilities being treated differently from the asset?
John C. R. Hele: No. We don't have that issue that prudential does. We have multicurrency reporting and that we avoid that volatility that prudential has.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: With regard to the share buyback, many of us are expecting that Met can resume share buybacks in 2014. Is that a reasonable assumption?
John C. R. Hele: I honestly don't know. We'll see what happens in 2013 in terms of regulation. We'll have a much greater clarity. It is our goal, as I mentioned earlier, to provide a good yield on our stock through an appropriate dividend and also to have share buybacks as part of our capital management process going forward. But we have to see how things sort out here in the current year around regulation coming out of Washington.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then switching gears for John, just so I understand that normalized run rate of operating earnings in the first quarter. If you normalize for the items you outlined, we get to a range of around $1.30 for the first quarter. Am I thinking about that the right way?
John C. R. Hele: Jay, you're good at math. That's exactly what I would think.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I can still subtract.
John C. R. Hele: You're still doing a good job, I guess.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then for Bill, what implied volatility assumption are you using for variable annuities?
William J. Wheeler: Well, you mean when we price, is that what you're referring to?
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes.
William J. Wheeler: Right around 100%. Or excuse me, not the implied volatility. The implied volatility is the hedging cost in total, we're assuming at about 100% when we priced. Right now, of course, they're running at about 115%, I think, or that's where they were for the first quarter.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And what duration liability do you use for implied vol?
William J. Wheeler: I think it's the 5-year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just to make sure this was really is that. With regards to the dividends, when I listened to the last quarter's call, it seemed like it was very cautious on any capital deployment before there was additional clarity from regulators. So what exactly changed since that call and into the point that the dividend was increased by 50%?
John C. R. Hele: Yes, I know that some people wanted me to make some statement as soon as we sold the bank. But we're not at the point where we're going to declare the dividend for the second quarter yet, and we have a process, of course, under normal corporate governance to go to our board and get approval for any sort of capital action of that nature. So the timing just wasn't right for us to make any declaration at that point in time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Smith from Scotia Capital.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division: Yes, I just -- most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I wanted to go back just to the capital management topic one last time, understanding that there's no expectation for share repurchase in 2014, you've already taken action on the dividend, you have a $2 billion Provida deal to close. Where do you stand in terms of capital deployment with respect to additional acquisitions? Because it seems that there has been some increased activity in that market right now. So could we look for potentially another deal this year? I mean, we don't want to build it into our expectations, but would that be a possibility?
John C. R. Hele: So I just wanted to make one correction. I think you said 2014 may be you meant 2013.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division: 2013. Sorry.
John C. R. Hele: Yes, okay, so just to clarify that. So no expectations of share buybacks in 2013, although, as I mentioned, the Provida deal, $2 billion approximately, will be a cash transaction, so we'll be using capital in that sense. I think that, as a practical matter, regulators look at acquisitions differently than share buybacks. Acquisitions should be generating earnings and have assets involved and so on. So we certainly will be looking at transactions over the course of this year, as we always do. There's nothing we can talk about at this point in time about a deal on the horizon, but we certainly look at most anything that comes in the market that could make sense from us strategically. And at that point in time, we'll make a decision about how we finance it if there were to be another deal going forward.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Edward A. Spehar: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings press release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. Before we begin, I'd like to highlight that we will be including additional disclosures in our 2012 10-K on our variable annuity business and the sensitivity of earnings to a sustained low interest rate environment. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report fourth quarter 2012 operating earnings of $1.4 billion, up 10% over the fourth quarter of 2011. Operating earnings per share were $1.25, above the guidance range of $1.12 to $1.22 provided on the December 2012 guidance call, and 7% over the fourth quarter of 2011. For the full year 2012, we reported operating earnings per share of $5.28, up 21% (sic) [22%] from 2011, and an operating return on equity of 11.3%. We are very pleased with these results given the challenging macroeconomic environment. John Hele will discuss our financial results in detail. I would like to highlight a few items. First, despite growing pressure in the U.S. from low interest rates, our investment spread margins were up in 3 of our 4 U.S. business lines. The strength of our investment spread margins reflects our prudent asset liability management and the benefits of our interest rate hedge program. We continue to manage the risks of low interest rates and take actions as appropriate. Second, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined at our May Investor Day. One of our cornerstone initiatives is to refocus the U.S. Business, which includes shifting our business mix away from market-sensitive, capital-intensive products to our protection-oriented, lower-risk products. On February 4, we introduced a new living benefit variable annuity product, GMIB Max V, to replace GMIB Max IV, which is no longer being sold. The biggest change between the 2 products is a reduction in the rollup rate from 5% to 4%. We believe that the new product will improve the risk profile of our VA sales and generate a higher expected return on economic capital. These changes are important components of our plan to reduce U.S. variable annuity sales from $17.7 billion in 2012 to $10 billion to $11 billion in 2013. Consistent with our strategy to grow emerging markets, another significant development is our agreement to acquire AFP Provida, the largest pension provider in Chile, from BBVA, for $2 billion in cash. MetLife is the #1 life insurer in Chile, and the Provida deal will further strengthen our market position. Employees in Chile are required to contribute a fixed percentage of their salaries to a mandatory pension system. Pension companies such as Provida charge an administrative fee on contributions, not assets under management. As a result, fee income does not fluctuate with market changes. Provida is the #1 player in the market, with a 29% market share. With this acquisition, MetLife's operating earnings from emerging markets are expected to grow from 14% today to approximately 17%, which brings us closer to our 2016 target of at least 20%. Also, as a fee-based business, Provida is consistent with our strategy of increasing our earnings from low capital intensity product offerings. In addition to being an excellent strategic fit, the Provida acquisition is very attractive on a financial basis. As I've said before, we strive to strike the right balance between growth, profitability and risk. We are acquiring Provida for approximately 10x projected forward earnings of roughly $200 million and anticipate that the transaction will be accretive to operating earnings by approximately $0.05 per share in 2013 and $0.15 per share in 2014. While accretion from a cash acquisition is one metric to consider, it does not necessarily determine if the transaction creates shareholder value. Therefore, we modeled the long-term EPS impact to Provida assuming we financed the transaction using a mixture of 75% equity and 25% debt. On this basis, we forecast that the transaction will be essentially neutral for EPS during the first few years and then become accretive. This analysis gives us comfort that the return on this transaction is likely to exceed our weighted average cost of capital. In addition, I have also discussed our goal of improving the free cash flow generation of our businesses. We estimate that approximately 70% of Provida's earnings will result in free cash flow available to our holding companies. I think the merits of this transaction are clear. It's important to note that the current regulatory restriction on our ability to repurchase shares was not the motivation to acquire Provida. We are doing this deal because it makes strategic and financial sense for our shareholders. I want to close my prepared remarks with a few comments on the regulatory environment. We are pleased that our de-banking process has progressed with the closing of the sale of MetLife Bank to GE Capital Retail Bank, and we look forward to no longer being a bank holding company. However, even after the de-banking process is complete, substantial uncertainty will likely remain on the regulatory front as we face the possibility of being named a nonbank systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. I'm -- as we have said in the past, we do not believe that our company poses systemic risk to the financial system, and we will continue to make that case to policymakers. However, if MetLife is deemed to be systemically important, it is imperative that the final prudential rules be tailored to the life insurance business model, which differs dramatically from that of banks. While it is our strong desire to return capital to shareholders, we will need to assess the regulatory environment before finalizing any share buyback program. The assumption of no share repurchases in our 2013 guidance reflects this regulatory uncertainty. We were asked on our December guidance call about our confidence in the share buyback assumption built into our plan through 2016. As I stated on the call, I am not completely confident that we can do all of the assumed $8 billion of gross share repurchases to -- through 2016, since it is dependent on the -- on external factors that are beyond our control. During our May 2012 Investor Day, we provided our goal of achieving an ROE of between 12% and 14% by 2016. I want to provide some guidance on the sensitivity to this range of share repurchases. If we were to assume no share buybacks through year-end 2016, our estimated operating ROE target range for 2016 would be approximately 100 basis points lower than it is today, all other assumptions held constant. Although we cannot predict what the future holds in terms of regulation and interest rates, we will continue to execute on our strategy and strike the right balance between growth, profitability and risk. Finally, I want to assure you that our 64,000 employees around the world are working hard to deliver on our promises to our customers and to create value for our shareholders. I am confident we will succeed. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion on insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I'll give you some color on the interest rate disclosure Ed referenced and then conclude with some comments on our cash and capital. To begin, MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.25 per share, up 10% over the fourth quarter of 2011. This quarter included a few notable items, which I highlighted during the -- our December guidance call. These 4 items dampened operating earnings by a net $13 million or $0.01 per share, better than the net $0.07 estimated in December. Let me give you some detail on the 4 items. The first was in our P&C business. Higher-than-budgeted catastrophe losses of $70 million after tax, primarily due to Superstorm Sandy, were partially offset by a favorable prior year reserve development of $13 million after tax. The net impact was $0.05 per share. The gross loss due to Sandy was approximately $150 million. Adjusting for reinsurance recoveries and taxes, the impact to operating earnings was $90 million. Both the gross and net loss were within the estimated ranges provided in December. The second notable item resulted from our annual assumption review. The portion related to operating earnings was a net unfavorable $13 million after tax, or $0.01 per share. In December, we'd estimated the assumption review would reduce operating earnings by $0.05 per share. We had a net positive of $37 million from DAC unlocking and reserve changes. The favorable unlocking related to our lower lapse assumption for VA was partially offset by negative unlocking for reductions in our general account and separate account return assumptions. Also included is a onetime $50 million after-tax write-down in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits of an intangible asset, representing the value of customer relationships acquired, otherwise known as VOCRA, related to a small acquisition of a dental business in 2008. I will provide an update of the below-the-line components of the assumption review in a few moments. The third notable item was $23 million or $0.02 per share of reorganization costs. Finally, pretax variable investment income was $376 million, reflecting strong private equity returns. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $242 million, which was $80 million or $0.07 per share above the top end of our 2012 quarterly guidance range. It's also $0.02 per share better than our estimated -- than our estimate provided in December. Turning to our bottom line results. Fourth quarter net income was $96 million or $0.09 per share and included net derivative losses of $855 million after tax. The net derivative loss in the quarter was primarily due to the mark-to-market impact of our VA program, including the update to our lapse assumptions of $342 million after tax. Additionally, the tightening of Met's own credit spreads during the quarter and the rise in long-term rates, also contributed to the net derivative loss. The net derivative loss was higher than we had estimated in December, but this is a difficult item to forecast, as it is highly sensitive to capital market movements. As a reminder, most of this impact is noneconomic, as a large portion of the liabilities that are being hedged are at essentially book value. The total impact on net income for the DAC and other assumption review was $752 million after tax, which was within the $600 million to $800 million range provided in December. Most of the charge, or $739 million, was outside of operating earnings. As noted in our December call, the charge relates primarily to changes in VA policyholder behavior lapse assumptions as well as general and separate account return assumptions for fixed income investments. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $46.73 at year end, below our December estimate, largely due to the higher derivative losses and essentially flat year-over-year. Operating ROE was 11.3% in 2012, up 120 basis points from 10.1% in 2011 and better than our 2012 plan of 10% to 10.6%. Turning now to margins. Underwriting was mixed but generally unfavorable this quarter. The mortality ratio in retail life was elevated at 99% due to unfavorable experience in both V and UL and traditional life. This result was higher than the target range of 85% to 90% and worse than the 81.1% ratio in the fourth quarter of 2011. The mortality ratio in group life was 84.6% in the quarter, slightly favorable to the prior year quarter of 85.2% and below the target range of 85% to 90%. Excluding a positive reserve adjustment, group life mortality was in the middle of our target range. Group health morbidity experience was unfavorable in the quarter, and I will provide some more detail on this line shortly. As you heard from Steve, investment spreads remained strong in 2012. In the fourth quarter, our investment spreads increased year-over-year and sequentially in Corporate Benefit Funding, annuities and retail life and were down only modestly from the sequential quarter in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits. You can see in our QFS that the spreads in the U.S. Business increased in 2012. While variable investment income was strong last year, our spreads, excluding VII, were mostly higher as well. Spreads excluding variable investment income are not evident from our QFS, so let me provide some detail. Deferred annuities was 284 basis points for the full year of 2012 versus 258 basis points in 2011. Variable and universal life was 167 versus 105. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits was 237 versus 250. Finally, Corporate Benefit Funding was 112 versus 105. While we expect investment spreads will decline in 2013, the resilience of our investment margins in 2012 illustrates that this is a manageable risk factor. As Ed referenced earlier, there will be a new disclosure in our 10-K on the anticipated impact of sustained low interest rates on our financial results. The low rate scenario in the 10-K is based on 1.69% 10-year Treasury yield for 2013 and 2014. This scenario contrasts with our plan, which assumes that 10-year Treasury gradually rises to 2.38% by the end of 2013 and then remains flat through the end of 2014. The difference between the 10-K scenario and our plan translates to an estimated negative impact on operating earnings of approximately $45 million in 2013 and approximately $150 million in 2014. The results for the 2013 low rate scenario are consistent with the guidance we provided on our December call, and the new disclosure on 2014 highlights the relatively small incremental impact on earnings next year if rates remain low. Turning to expenses. The operating expense ratio was 22.4% for the fourth quarter and 23.8% for the full year of 2012. This was better than our plan of 23.9% to 24.5% and our estimate in December. Excluding the impact of pension and post-retirement benefits and close-outs, the operating expense ratio was 24.5% for the fourth quarter and 24.1% for the full year of 2012. This compares to the fourth quarter and full year of 2011 of 24.6% and 24.1%, respectively. I will now discuss some of the business highlights in the quarter. Rather than go through every segment, I want to focus on areas where our results may differ from your expectations. Therefore, my comments will be on, number one, retail annuities; two, Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits; and number three, Asia. Retail annuities had operating earnings of $462 million, an increase of $253 million from the prior year quarter. Normalized earnings were 200 -- were $320 million in the fourth quarter after adjusting for a positive DAC unlocking of $133 million from our annual assumption review and variable investment income that was $9 million above plan. On a normalized basis, retail annuities earnings were up 30% versus the fourth quarter of 2011 due to growth in the business, interest on economic capital, lower DAC amortization and lower operating expenses. Higher interest on economic capital reflects the increased amount of capital we're allocating to this business line. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $167 million, down 30% year-over-year. After adjusting for above-plan catastrophe experience of $33 million, the VOCRA write-down of $50 million and $36 million of other favorable items, normalized operating earnings were $214 million, down 11% versus the prior year. The decline on a normalized basis was primarily due to an elevated group health benefit ratio of 91.6%, which was 89.7% in the prior year quarter, and the targeted range of 86% to 90%. The primary drivers of the higher ratio were long-term disability and long-term care. In disability, we saw higher average reserves on new claims and lower net closures, partially offset by lower claim incidents. In long-term care, the benefit ratio was above plan due to higher average reserves and new claims, lower net closures and reserve adjustments. Although long-term care earnings are under pressure, we believe this suggests only a couple of pennies risk to our 2013 EPS guidance. While the group health benefit ratio was elevated for the quarter, the full year 2012 ratio was 88.6% and within our plan range. With regard to statutory results, we completed our asset adequacy testing for 2012 and we will have no reserve strengthening in long-term care. New York requires us to have a segregated account for long-term care, with stand-alone cash flow testing. This is a more stringent approach relative to other states and should provide comfort to our investors regarding the balance sheet for this business. Turning to Asia. Operating earnings of $198 million in the quarter were down 24% year-over-year. Asia had negative DAC unlockings of $62 million, higher than we had estimated in December, primarily due to changes in long-term lapse assumptions in Japan. Adjusting for this, normalized operating earnings were $260 million, down 1% year-over-year. I know analysts and investors have concerns regarding the recent earnings for Asia. The current environment for the region, most notably in Japan, has some challenges. Since we developed our 2013 plan, the yen has weakened materially and interest rates are lower than we had anticipated. Based on those 2 factors, our current operating earnings expectation for Asia will be close to the low end of our 2013 guidance range. Specifically with regard to currency, we have hedges on our 2013 projected yen-exposed operating earnings at strike prices above JPY 90 to the U.S. dollar. These hedges are currency options which provide protection against the yen weakening above JPY 90 but allow us to participate in the upside should the yen strengthen. However, we are unhedged for the yen between JPY 90 and our average plan rate of approximately JPY 82. It is worth noting that we remain disciplined in Japan. There are more questions today on the profitability of various products and distribution channels in Japan, with concerns relating to savings products and the bank channel. In the fourth quarter, our total Japan sales were down 1% and this was driven by a 34% decline in our bank channel sales. Our decline in the bank channel resulted from a conscious effort to maintain margins. Finally, let me discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.7 billion at year end, slightly above our guidance call estimate due to the timing of certain cash flows. We plan to use $2 billion from our existing cash and liquid assets at the holding companies to fund the Provida acquisition, which is not contemplated in our guidance call outlook for 2013. Moving to our capital position. While we have not completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2012, we estimate our RBC ratio will be in the 450% to 475% range, which is above the 425% to 450% range we provided on our December guidance call. We estimate that our Japan solvency margin ratio will be at the high end of our guidance range of 800% to 900%. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the fourth quarter of 2012 were approximately $1.5 billion and a loss of approximately $200 million, respectively. Fourth quarter operating earnings benefited from a favorable market, while the net loss resulted from a new statutory accounting treatment for certain partnerships and joint ventures. This accounting change caused a shift from an unrealized loss to a realized loss and was neutral for capital and surplus. For the full year 2012, statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.4 billion and statutory net income was approximately $2.8 billion. Our total adjusted capital is expected to be approximately $29 billion as of December '12, up 5% compared to the prior year. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first, from the line of Jeff Schuman with KBW.
Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I just wonder if you can give a little bit more color about the international growth outlook. If we look at the fourth quarter or 2012 as a whole, I think Latin America premium growth was pretty modest relative to your normalized expectations, and yet I think you forecasted pretty big acceleration in 2013. I just wonder if you can remind us why that is. And I guess, if you could touch on Asia a little bit. But even before the recent devaluation, your outlook there was, I think, for premium growth to decelerate quite significantly relative to what we've seen recently. And so maybe you can remind us kind of what the factors are there, please.
William J. Wheeler: Jeff, it's Bill Wheeler. I'll talk about Latin America. The -- so revenue growth on a constant currency basis was about 4%. We are forecasting, I guess, on a constant currency basis too, 10% for next year. We had very good sales volumes. Our sales volumes in Latin America were up to 26% year-over-year. What held back the overall PFO growth rate was there's a couple of group cases that we have lost, one in Mexico, one in Chile, that are large. They weren't terribly profitable. And so that's affected our top line growth. Now we've -- I think we've said this before on other calls, especially in the third quarter, the comparison, especially the one in Mexico, we lost at the beginning of this year. So that comparison will go away next year. And Latin America, except for noise like these group cases, is I think more like a 10% grower.
John C. R. Hele: And with regard to Asia -- this is John. With -- our bank channel was down, which has a large premium -- these are joint [ph] single premium products, so it's quite an impact when you look at the premiums. But we're seeing growth in the independent agency channels and other areas across Asia. So we're pleased that we're remaining disciplined as we grow all of our channels.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Just a couple of questions on Provida. Should we assume that the 70% of GAAP earnings, which I think you characterized as $200 million, would you expect that to be fully dividended to the holding company?
John C. R. Hele: We expect that to be a good distribution. It may go to the international holding companies because it's in the international operations, but we expect that to be available.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just a few quick questions. The -- I think you characterized the returns on this as at least equal to your weighted average cost of capital. I mean, how should we think about the IRRs on this trade? I mean, I would assume it would be above your weighted average cost of capital. Should we look at this, given growth, et cetera, as low-teens, mid-teens, high-teens? How did you -- what's the IRR that you're projecting on this?
John C. R. Hele: We're looking at this as a mid-teen return. And we think, given -- that's a good return given the Chilean economy and environment. It's one of the best places to be investing in, if you call it an emerging market. It's a very stable government and economy. So we're very pleased with that type of return.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then maybe just -- I guess, just going back to the comment about -- that Steve made on buybacks and an impact going out to 2016 if there were 0 buybacks. Obviously, the difference between 0 and $8 billion is a very wide range. And I think it's helpful to frame out kind of what I would hope to be kind of a downside scenario, but is there any feel for how we should be thinking about or moderating capital deployment expectations out to 2016? I mean, is that -- I assume the answer isn't 0, but is there any feeling for maybe what management is kind of thinking about as a reasonable range?
Steven A. Kandarian: I can't give you a lot of guidance at this very moment. As things unfold here in the coming months, I think we'll be able to provide more clarity, but we're still doing our analysis. We're still trying to understand the regulatory environment and what the capital rules may be, going forward, for us. So unfortunately, I can't give you more than that.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just one final question, if I may. With the Provida acquisition and the free cash flow generated from that, is there any change in your view on the deleveraging that you're expecting it -- as part of your capital model looking out to '13?
John C. R. Hele: No, not really. I mean, Provida will close sometime later on this year, so -- and it's uncertain when that might close, so it's hard to predict exactly the cash and earnings impact it would have in 2013.
Operator: The next question is from Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners.
Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC: First question was, could you just remind us of your operating EPS sensitivity to the equity market? Because I think that the market is probably running 4% or 5% better than in your original assumption at this point.
John C. R. Hele: For about 1% change in the S&P 500, it's about $0.01.
Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC: $0.01, annually?
John C. R. Hele: In our EPS?
Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC: Yes.
John C. R. Hele: Off of EPS, yes.
Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC: Yes, okay. And then back to the group nonmedical health business. When you gave the 2013 outlook, did -- were you fully -- did you kind of have all the information on the fourth quarter and some of the weakness that occurred in -- was that factored into the outlook for '13?
John C. R. Hele: Well, in terms of the group, the full year was within our targeted range, so we still believe our targeted range is appropriate for 2013.
Operator: Our next question is from Suneet Kamath with UBS.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: First question is just on the long-term ROE target without buyback, the 11% to 13%. I guess I'm pleasantly surprised that that's up from what you're doing -- what you did in 2012 at the midpoint. So 2 questions on that. First, what is the interest rate environment that's predicated in that 11% to 13%? And then second, in terms of the $8 billion of capital that you would not be buying back in this scenario, what is the return that you're getting -- or the assumption for the return that you're getting on that capital?
John C. R. Hele: With regard to the first question, I think that we've said that should rates remain generally flat, we expect to be at the lower end of that 12% to 14% with the buybacks. And now without the buybacks, the 11% to 13% range, we'll be at the low end of that range. And could you say your second question again? I didn't get that.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just on the $8 billion of capital that you would not be using for share buybacks, what's the return assumption in this scenario? Or how is that capital being used?
John C. R. Hele: That's in a series of investments, so it would be high-quality liquid investments...
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: But it's like a bond return, as opposed to, like, a...
John C. R. Hele: Yes, yes, shorter-term bond returns.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess, the other question, on the VA DAC. I think at the guidance -- on the guidance conference call, you characterized half of the roughly $700 million impact being related to a change in your fixed income return assumption, your separate account growth model from, I think it was like, 7.5% to 7.25%. So I guess, first is that accurate? And then second, how does that return compare to your assumption for equity? And then I guess, related to that, if that 7.25% maybe has to come down again because interest rates are rising and bond returns are falling, could we be looking at another sizable DAC hit at some point down the road?
John C. R. Hele: So of the total charge, about 1/2 was lapsed; and 1/4, returns; and 1/4 for other. And with regard to the -- that's a separate account assumption, which is a blended assumption, which is an equity bond assumption weighting. But people also have the opportunity to switch to a general account if bonds rise, so if interest rates rise and bond funds go down. So we're comfortable with this return.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then just lastly, on the comments that you made, John, about the year-end stat net income versus operating income, does any of that change the cash flow roll-forward that you guys provided to us in terms of your outlook? The $3 billion to $3.5 billion of subsidiary dividends, is that still in place? Or is this affected somehow by that net income loss?
John C. R. Hele: No, this is within our range that we had expected.
Operator: Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I had a few questions, first on the Latin American business. The reported earnings seem close to the level that they've been in recent quarters. You didn't call anything out, but it seems like there's a tax benefit, because on a pretax basis, the earnings are a lot weaker than they've been in recent quarters. And then for Steve, could you just discuss how ALICO is tracking versus your initial assumptions? Because if you look at Asia earnings, they've been weaker than expected the last few quarters. You ended up taking a reserve charge this quarter as well. And then finally, on just your capital deployment philosophy. Assuming that you are able to de-register as a bank holding company, would you want to wait for SIFI guidance before you do something with the dividend or buybacks? Or could one -- or could you raise the dividend even before the SIFI guidance comes out? How would you view that if you -- assuming that you are able to de-register as a bank holding company over the next few months?
John C. R. Hele: Yes, I hope we got all these questions, Jimmy. On the Latin American business, there was an $18 million tax benefit. It's in Latin America, but it's offset in corporate, so it's not a total change to our normalized earnings. If you could repeat the second question.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: The second, just views on, like, how the ALICO business is tracking versus initial assumptions, given the weakness in Asia earnings recently.
Steven A. Kandarian: So overall, ALICO is tracking well. There's ups and downs and there's some of the markets that we're in with ALICO that are tracking a little bit below our expectations, some of the markets were above. So overall, the ALICO transaction is still very much on target for what we assumed going into the transaction. We're very happy that we did the deal and think it's a very attractive transaction on many bases, strategic as well as financial. In terms of our dividend, Jimmy, I -- it's the same issue that we have around share buybacks. We're going to assess all these factors, regulatory factors. We're going to talk our board, obviously, and get board approval before we make any changes on our dividends. So that still is to come.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just following up on Latin America. The -- on a pretax basis, what drove the weakness there in earnings?
John C. R. Hele: Well, we've been growing direct marketing and a lot of the new business channels, moving to our multiple distribution channels throughout Asia -- throughout Latin America. And that's had some higher costs associated with that. Direct marketing doesn't get DAC-ed as much, so you have just higher fixed cost in the year.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And I did notice that you added the P&C income statement, so I guess we could thank Ed for that.
John C. R. Hele: You can definitely thank Ed for that, yes.
Operator: And next, we go to Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A few questions for John. Can you just explain again what was the driver of the statutory loss for the quarter and why, with the loss, RBC came in higher than expected? Was there something going on, some moving parts there?
John C. R. Hele: Sure. So this was for an investment that we had that had unrealized losses, and that was deducted from capital. And we -- there was a change in statutory accounting or an interpretation in statutory accounting. We're now reflecting more of this through net income. So we moved from an unrealized loss to a realized loss through net income, but it was just a geography change to the income statement and had no impact on capital.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Did you say that was -- was that limited partnership investments? So what type of investments were those?
John C. R. Hele: It was a joint venture and limited partnership type investment.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And was that $1 billion? Or how big was that?
John C. R. Hele: It's a series of them, and it was about that amount.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then -- and how -- why did the RBC go up?
John C. R. Hele: Just from core favorable markets and good operating earnings.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. So the impact of the loss was, I guess -- was that already being factored in when it was an unrealized loss and so it wasn't much of a change on the RBC? I'm just a little confused as to why that wouldn't have...
John C. R. Hele: Yes, well, because it's not in your capital. It's not counted as part of your capital. It's an unrealized loss.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Understood. The other question I had for you was on the variable annuity policyholder behavior charge, $342 million. I guess, just a general question on it. How do we get confidence that you've taken enough on this? We don't have any parameters to really measure this around, just that, I guess you got more conservative, you lowered the lapse rate. Because we've seen other competitors of yours with similar product structure take multiple charges. So is there any way you can give us confidence that we're not going to -- this isn't the first of a series of charges.
John C. R. Hele: Okay, well, this was done after several years of study as customers who are in or close to the money get off of their surrender charge period. And we've had a few years of experience now. We also participated in an industry study of almost many of the major players, and our experience is tracking very well or almost exactly to that industry study. So I think we're pretty comfortable with where we are now, both we've had a few years of experience of this and how people behave as they get close to the money. When we looked at this, our assumptions are pretty good when people are well out of the money and well in the money. The curve for this dynamic lapse function, where we had to adjust it, was how people react when they get close to being in the money. And people are a little more sensitive than we had all initially assumed. We had benchmarked our original assumptions somewhat 10 years ago against people and we were pretty close to what others had done. But we've now adjusted, I think, to be what the experience is truly coming out. We had to wait until people get off their surrender charge period and also see people who might be closer in the money, so you can really see the experience of how to calibrate this loss function. But we've had, not only experience of a few years, but also industry experience.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: But John, hasn't the progression been worse, meaning lapses have continued to decline on sort of a consistent basis? And if that -- are you assuming continued shrinkage of the lapse rate? Or how should I think about that?
John C. R. Hele: Well, it depends how people move in and out of the money and what happens to the equity markets and interest rates, so it is quite dynamic in how we price this and reserve for it. So it's not a simple answer that I can give you, but we have reflected our experience and I think we're comfortable right now with where we stand on this function.
Operator: Our next question is from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I have a question for Steve. I'm just curious if you could give us any color around what the process was like gaining approvals from -- in particular, from the Federal Reserve for the Provida deal.
Steven A. Kandarian: John, we weren't required to actually get an approval from any federal regulator on this, but we certainly talked to our regulators when there's any significant transaction we're engaged in. So there was communication, but there was not an approval process.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Yes, I understand that. I'm -- I guess I'm just wondering if there was any real back-and-forth real questions about -- or many -- any indication maybe as part of that dialogue as to what specific capital levels or specific ratios or items were of most concern to the Federal Reserve around this deal around your capital levels.
Steven A. Kandarian: Yes, I'm not -- I don't wish to speak about confidential conversations with federal regulators. Probably not a good thing to do.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I figured I had to give it a shot. The incremental disclosure around rate sensitivity, in particular, I guess, around the annuities business. I understand, so the impact on an operating earnings basis when we look out the next couple of years is relatively modest, but you didn't really speak to anything below the line as it relates to DAC charges or reserve adjustments or any such thing. I was wondering, is there any help you can provide there? Because I assume we'd see some impacts as well there.
John C. R. Hele: Well, below the line, if rates stay lower, our derivatives are going to be higher, so we'd have gains from where we are now, so it's hard to predict what. Because a lot of this is noneconomic when you get to the net income side.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: So I guess we should just assume that below-the-line impact to the 1.69% 10-year for the next couple of years will be essentially immaterial relative to your base plan?
John C. R. Hele: No, I wouldn't -- the net income is quite sensitive to how markets move, and most -- the vast majority of this movement is noneconomic in nature. The dynamic lapse function change we did to VAs, that was an economic change. But the rest of it is really noneconomic in nature and it's -- I can't predict how that's going to move quarter to quarter.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. Last question is just thinking about the annuity segment in the core earnings. If I look back at the last several quarters and then look at fourth quarter, you're suggesting to us that the core earnings level for this segment has increased from the first 3 quarters of the year, somewhere around $240 million average rates -- average quarterly earnings level, to now $320 million in the fourth quarter. And if we were to run-rate off of a $320 million, that puts your guidance for the annuity segment for 2013 -- I think it clearly indicates that guidance would be very conservative. So is there something still inside the fourth quarter core number that we should be thinking about as not something that's going to recur as we move forward?
John C. R. Hele: Well, the retail annuity business has a lot of ups and downs. It's sensitive to the marketplace and what goes on in that business. So we're not updating our guidance on that at this time.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Well, sorry, I mean, the first 3 quarters of the year, though, on a core basis, the volatility in those earnings was not nearly as severe. I guess to the extent that there's any help you can provide, it would be appreciated.
John C. R. Hele: We're not going to update our guidance at this time.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So I guess you guys are doing a good job slowing down sort of the run-on of VA sales, but curious if you're considering any strategies to accelerate the runoff of VAs, either through buyout programs or if there are any structures or vehicles out there that you would explore.
William J. Wheeler: Chris, it's Bill Wheeler. We aren't -- I think our strategies about VA is obviously, we're driving down GMIB sales and we're making product changes to do that. I think you'll see us make some announcements about new product introductions later this year, and that will -- as we sort of change the character of that business. In terms of buying out in-force, I -- we've examined that. We've looked at what others have done. I don't think that's an option we're considering at this time.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And are you still committed to the GMIB product? Or would you consider other living benefit features?
William J. Wheeler: Well, it -- I'm not sure this is well appreciated. We sell more than a GMIB today. We sell a healthy amount of lifetime withdrawal benefit. And I think what you're going to see going forward is a much more diverse annuity new business model going -- in terms of what we're going to sell.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just a one quick follow-up, just on the returns of the new 4% rollup rate versus what you were selling before. How much different are your expected returns?
William J. Wheeler: Well, so GMIB IV, with the 5% rollup rate but the lower dollar-for-dollar, had an ROI in the fourth quarter of about 15.8%. And GMIB V, with the 4% rollup rate, has our ROI modeled as over 18%. So it's a meaningful jump.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then one just quick question for John. I guess, book value x AOCI is up just $0.04 year-over-year and it's grown, I guess, just 3% since '08. So what can be done to accelerate the growth in book? Or is your hedging strategy to protect economic capital, versus maybe smoothing GAAP results, really just put you at the mercy of below-the-line charges that are kind of out of your control?
John C. R. Hele: Well, clearly, it moves around a lot and we just have to continue to focus on it. And it's one of those metrics, I think, that it's even hard year-over-year to look at -- you have to look at it over a long-term time horizon. But we want to make sure that we have it in our sight and we are -- we will slowly, over time, we believe that this can improve.
Operator: Our next question is from Sean Dargan with Macquarie.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research: Following up on the notion that book value ex AOCI is not growing much. Your long-term ROE target, is that impacted at all by book value perhaps being lower than where people were thinking about at the time of your Investor Day?
John C. R. Hele: No, other than for the adjustments we've already announced in terms of the goodwill.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research: Okay. Just in thinking about long-term care, are we correct to think that if interest rates stay where they are and mortality and utilization is consistent with what you saw in the fourth quarter, in that scenario, there would only be a couple of penny impact to 2013 EPS?
John C. R. Hele: Yes.
Operator: The next go to John Hall with Wells Fargo Securities.
John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: This question's for Steve. As I think about the de-banking process, I guess the way we think about it is it's ultimately going to occur and then you must also be planning, in some fashion, for it to occur. So I guess the question has to do with, do you have sort of a series of contingency plans about the de-banking process that, when you get actual word of it, you can move quickly, depending upon when that word comes, whether it's perhaps 2 weeks from now or 6 months from now?
Steven A. Kandarian: John, we are obviously planning for it. And there's still some work being done on our side in terms of assessing the regulatory landscape. We do get insights on an ongoing basis. That's why I'm reluctant at this point in time to make any pronouncements around share repurchases, dividend changes and the like, because the landscape does evolve. And until we get to that point when we're able to take capital actions, we don't think it's prudent for us to make pronouncements that may end up changing over time.
John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Understood. But say you got word in 2 weeks, do you have a contingency plan to roll forward to the board on whatever your decision would be?
Steven A. Kandarian: We have ongoing conversations and have for many quarters with our board on these issues. So it's not as if we're going to start with them in a few weeks to have this discussion. But we're doing a lot of analysis internally around all kinds of measures that can impact us from a capital perspective, and that has to be taken into account as we decide how we address the issue of capital.
Operator: And next we'll go to Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.
Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Two questions. First, admittedly, the Europe and the Eastern Europe -- or Europe, Middle East and Africa business is the smallest of your 3 international units. But there too, there seems to be a revenue issue in the quarter on a constant currency basis. I think the revenues were flat or down there or very -- essentially flat. What's happening there? And then my second question relates to Japan. I'm just hoping you can provide additional detail on the nature of the products that are subject to this intense competition that you referenced. Is it -- and the nature of the competition. Is it pricing? Is it terms? And who is proving to be the troublemaker here? Is it indigenous companies? Is it foreign competitors?
John C. R. Hele: Let me answer the question on Europe. We stopped selling in the U.K. annuities, so we're down $57 million year-on-year in PFOs on that and sales. So that makes a difference. We also have weakness in Western Europe, but that's been offset by strong growth in Russia, Turkey and also the AVIVA acquisition. So it's kind of balanced out some negatives with some positives, and that's why you're seeing it sort of flattish.
Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Actually, before we go on to -- I appreciate that. Just one quick question about this premium fees and other that you referenced. I'm just wondering, given the transition that Met is effecting away from high capital-intensive products -- so let's just say, given the transition that you contemplated that you're beginning here towards more, let's say, insurance products, you continue to publish this statistic and highlight it, which suggests to me that you think it's important, but I'm just wondering whether you're giving thought to and whether you might go in the direction of looking at total operating revenues if investment income figures -- if in fact it will be the case that investment income will figure increasingly prominently in your revenue mix. I just don't know and I'd like to know how you're thinking about that.
John C. R. Hele: Well, we'll take that under consideration, but I think we're comfortable now with how we record our revenues.
Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Now if you could just talk about Japan a little bit, I would be grateful.
John C. R. Hele: Actually, I missed your question. Could you repeat Japan?
Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Sure. So earlier in the conversation, there was the discussion about -- I think there was reference to certain competition in the bank channel. And I was just looking for a little bit more detail about the specific products that are being subject to competition. Is it explicit pricing? Is it other terms on the contracts that are the subject of the competition? And who are proving to be the troublesome competitors? Is it indigenous companies, or is it your foreign competitors?
John C. R. Hele: Okay, so what's still in the bank channel are mainly single premium style products, both in yen, U.S. dollar and Australian dollar and some other currencies. And of course, as interest rates move throughout 2012, these products can become more or less attractive. And you have to be very careful with these product lines. You have to adjust your crediting rates quickly, and if you don't, you can get a large volume of lower ROE business. And so we have been diligent in ensuring that the business that we do sell to the bank channel meets our profitability hurdles.
Christopher Townsend: And let me just add to that. It's Chris Townsend here. So as John referenced, the minus 34% in the bank channel earlier, I think the way for you to look at Japan would be look at the breadth of distribution of product that we have. So while the bank channel is down, I assure you that we're growing very fast in terms of the A&H products through the bank channel. We grew at 76% for the quarter. And we're selling A&H through 40 different banks at the moment in Japan, and also our independent agency grew at about 26% for the quarter. So we've got different levers to pull to make sure we're adhering to the discipline that both Steve and John referenced earlier.
Steven A. Kandarian: Eric, let me just make one other comment. This is Steve. When we did our Investor Day in May of last year, we did not give guidance on the top line, and that was very intentional. And that was a signal of a shift in thinking at our company about what we should be focusing on in the near term as we look at our strategic initiatives, as we try to refocus our business on markets that we think will create shareholder value for us. So it's not that we don't have internal targets on top line, but we're trying to signal we're not going run this company based upon the top line, drive sales that may end up being sales that come back later and with low ROEs for us. And that is I think, a cultural shift here. And again, we are looking to grow our business but we are looking to grow profitably, are looking to get business on the books that is in excess of our cost of equity capital and that really is the driving force here for us.
Operator: Our final question will come from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.
Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: If I could just quickly, and then go into some other things. Chris, maybe you could touch on the A&H business in Japan. I think Aflac came out and said, April 1, they're going to hold their rates steady. I think Sumitomo said that they were going to lower rates 3%. What's Met doing, come April 1?
Christopher Townsend: We've promised a 15% EC [ph] ROI, and that's consistent across all of our product range, including A&H.
Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay, so no change there. If I may, Steve, a little bit of a conflict I have here in my thinking. Most companies would say, "I've got $8 billion to deploy. I'm going to deploy that through either acquisitions or through share repurchase." You don't -- is it fair to say you don't see it like that, that you don't think that $2 billion for Provida comes out of that $8 billion?
Steven A. Kandarian: I think it does. I mean, we have X amount of capital available to either make acquisitions with or to do share buybacks or to raise our dividend, yes.
Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. So I guess I don't get the downside guidance of if we don't do this $8 billion. Shouldn't it be, if we don't do this $6 billion?
Steven A. Kandarian: Well, we did have baked into our guidance for -- through 2016, the plan, some acquisition activity. Some was in there. It wasn't any super large deals, but there were some ongoing acquisitions that we assumed in that plan.
Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. John, if you could -- I don't know. You guys haven't done this before, I don't think, but it might be worthwhile in this case, if you're willing. A point on the actual to expected in individual life, what does that equal to in earnings?
John C. R. Hele: I think 1 point is about $2 million.
Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: 1 point is about $2 million, okay. And then finally, the guidance that you gave, it was a little unclear. The guidance that you gave on the interest rate assumption, that was cumulative, so it was 45 in the first year, going up another 95. So that was a cumulative thing, that wasn't another 150?
John C. R. Hele: 150 is the combined number.
Edward A. Spehar: Okay, thank you very much for joining us. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John McCallion, Head of Investor Relations.
John McCallion: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2012 earnings call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings press release, our quarterly financial supplements and in the other Financial Information section. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also, here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss our financial results for the third quarter, I want to express my condolences to those who have suffered great loss as a result of Hurricane Sandy. At MetLife, we are doing everything we can to help our customers cope with the impact of the storm. Our claims associates are on the ground helping customers find shelter, facilitating temporary repairs and issuing advance payments for immediate expenses. We know there is still a tremendous amount of work to do before life returns to normal, and our thoughts are especially with those who are hardest hit by the storm. I also want to thank all of you for being on this call under these difficult circumstances. Now let me turn to MetLife's financial performance. I would like to begin this morning by discussing the goodwill impairment we recorded in the third quarter of 2012. As we've indicated on previous earnings calls, as well as during our interest rate call last November, a prolonged low-rate environment might cause us to impair some or all of the goodwill in our U.S. retail annuity business. In the third quarter of 2012, we took a $1.6 billion after-tax goodwill impairment in this business to reflect the expected market impact of continued low interest rates, changes in the regulatory environment and other market and economic factors. MetLife delivered another solid quarter with operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.32 per share, up 47% from the third quarter of 2011. Adjusting for certain onetime items that depressed the results in the prior year quarter, operating earnings still rose by 23%. John Hele will discuss our third quarter results in greater detail in a few moments. I would like to highlight a few aspects of MetLife's performance that tie to our enterprise strategy, which we developed to address the external economic environment facing life insurers. As you know, one of our strategic goals is to refocus the U.S. business by shifting our business mix from more capital-intensive and interest rate-sensitive products to simpler protection and fee-based products. Our results and activities in the third quarter were consistent with this strategy. Premiums, fees and other revenues rose by 9% in our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefit business on strong sales and on revenues from the TRICARE Dental contract. Variable annuity sales in the United States declined by 46% from the prior year quarter to $4.6 billion, in line with our plan. We continued to manage the risk associated with this business. During the quarter, we launched a new product with lower withdrawal and payout rates. In addition, we limited the ability to deposit new money into a number of our existing contracts that have more generous guarantees. In our Corporate Benefit Funding business, sales of structured settlements and pension closeouts were both down, reflecting the lumpy nature of this business segment. We see tremendous opportunity in the pension closeout business, especially as interest rates rise over time. However, as with any use of capital, we are committed to ensuring that the new business in this segment clears our hurdle rate. During the quarter, MetLife also announced the creation of our new third-party asset-management business. This fee-based business requires very little capital and leverages the strong investment expertise we've built up over the decades. We have well-established business platforms for originating commercial mortgages, investing in real estate equity and sourcing private placements. We also possess the talent, scale, reputation and in-market presence to acquire high-quality assets with the potential for strong returns. Finally, I would point to our pilot project with Walmart to sell term life policies to the middle market. While we are in the very early days and do not have reportable results, we will continue to pursue these kinds of innovative approaches to selling simple protection products through new direct channels. Another strategic imperative for MetLife is to grow our business in emerging markets. The third quarter saw progress on this goal as well. In Latin America, sales rose 28% year-over-year, led by large group life cases in Mexico. And in EMEA, sales rose 15% year-over-year, driven by our acquisition in Turkey and higher credit life sales in Russia. Regarding the sale of MetLife Bank, 2 key developments occurred during the quarter: first, we amended the purchase agreement to sell the bank to GE Capital Retail Bank, which has submitted its application for approval to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The key terms of the agreement remain unchanged. And second, MetLife received a letter from the Federal Reserve granting us an extension until January 5, 2013, to file a revised capital plan. Until our debanking process is complete, we remain regulated by the Federal Reserve as a bank-holding company. After our debanking process is complete, we face the possibility of being named a non-bank systemically important financial institution, or SIFI, which would place us back under Federal Reserve supervision. As we have said many times, we do not believe regulated insurance activities pose systemic risk to the U.S. financial system. However, in the event that MetLife and other insurance companies are named SIFIs, the impact will depend on how the final prudential rules are written. It will be important that the prudential rules be tailored for the life insurance business model, which differs dramatically from that of banks. Overall, I am pleased with the results MetLife delivered in the third quarter. Our continued solid operating earnings performance reflects the fundamental strength of our diverse global business. Our focus on pricing discipline and risk management is especially important in this challenging economic environment, which shows few signs of abating. We will continue to monitor the external factors impacting our business and respond accordingly. In the coming weeks, we'll be finalizing our 2013 plan projections, which we will share with you on our next Investor Day call this December 13. Before I conclude, I want to mention that this will be John McCallion's last earnings call as Head of Investor Relations. John is becoming the CFO of our EMEA region, and I want to thank him for his help in communicating our value proposition to MetLife's investors over the past 2 years. John will be handing the reins to Ed Spehar, who has covered the insurance industry for more than 20 years as an equity analyst. It is now my pleasure to introduce John Hele, our new CFO. John has more than 30 years of experience in the financial services industry, having worked for Arch Capital Group, ING Group and Merrill Lynch, among others. His deep technical expertise of world markets -- knowledge of world markets and strong risk management skills are a welcome addition to our global leadership team. With that, I will turn the call over to John.
John C. R. Hele: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I wish to add to Steve's comments of our concern for those still without power and/or heat and for those who have had damages or losses in this historical storm. As for the potential financial impact to MetLife from Hurricane Sandy, at this time, it is too early to develop a reliable estimate. Before I review our results in the quarter, let me provide some color on the key macro factors impacting our financial performance. Interest rates continue to remain low in the U.S., assisted by another round of quantitative easing and also in most countries in which we operate. While the 10-year Treasury yield was essentially flat in the quarter, closing at 1.63%, it is down nearly 30 basis points versus the year-ago period. In addition, and perhaps more significantly, U.S. corporate spreads further tightened in the quarter across most asset classes in which we invest, generally by 10 to 50 basis points. While asset spread tightening is not readily apparent in our product net spreads as provided in our quarterly financial supplement, they do impact our new money rates and will pressure product spreads over time. On the plus side, the U.S. equity market performed well this quarter with the S&P 500 up 5.8%. By comparison, the S&P 500 was down 14.4% in the third quarter of 2011. This change in the S&P 500 performance resulted in a positive year-over-year variance of approximately $120 million of after-tax operating earnings in our retail annuities segment. With that as a backdrop, let me now discuss our results for this quarter. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.32 per share, up 47% over the third quarter of 2011. This quarter's results included a few offsetting significant items. However, the prior year third quarter had several significant items, which had a net negative impact on operating earnings per share of $0.17. Adjusted for those items, operating earnings were up 23% year-over-year. In addition, as noted in our 8-K filed on October 24, in the third quarter of 2012, we began to report all MetLife Bank operations as divested businesses. This change in reporting positively impacted operating earnings per share in the quarter by $0.02 while lowering operating earnings per share in the prior third quarter by $0.02. On a U.S. GAAP basis, MetLife reported a net loss of $984 million or $0.92 per share, which includes a $1.6 billion after-tax goodwill impairment and net derivative losses of $467 million after tax. As previously disclosed, we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the third quarter. This year, the testing indicated a full impairment of the goodwill associated with the U.S. retail annuities business, resulting in a noncash charge of $1.9 billion or $1.6 billion after tax. This includes $176 million of goodwill recorded in the Corporate & Other segment, representing tax benefits related to this annuity business. Goodwill testing starts with the -- estimating the fair value of the business based on a market participant view. While interest rates have been low for some time, during the third quarter, U.S. Treasury rates hit their lowest point since World War II. Also, the Federal Reserve extended the time frame they see low interest rates being warranted until 2015 and also initiated Quantitative Easing 3. These factors indicated that an extended period of low interest rates needed to be reflected in the fair value estimate, particularly on the return to market buyer may assume associated with the fixed income portion of the separate accounts. We believe buyers of an annuity business, particularly a variable annuity block, will be looking for a capital-efficient structure, most likely one involving captive and/or offshore strategies. Given the industry-wide inquiries on the use of affiliated captive reinsurers, buyers may now discount the ability to fully utilize these structures. These, and other market conditions, led to a significantly lower fair value for the business than in prior years. And when you follow through to the measurement step in the goodwill accounting process, this lower value resulted in full impairment of the recorded goodwill. This charge does not have an impact on the bank holding company capital ratios, which exclude goodwill from the calculations nor on our U.S. statutory results. As for the potential DAC and GAAP loss recognition impairments, while we review these each quarter, we conduct a comprehensive annual review of all the model assumptions in the fourth quarter, which include interest rates, equity returns, policyholder behavior, mortality, et cetera. We will need to complete our analysis before determining if there would be any impact in the fourth quarter. As for the net derivative losses in the quarter, it was primarily due to: one, the impact on the value of embedded options in our VA hedging program as a result of MET's own credit spreads tightening in the quarter; two, the rise in long-term rates; and three, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currency such as the euro, Canadian dollar and British pound in the quarter. Next, I would like to discuss some of the key financial metrics we focus on each quarter. First, as I mentioned earlier, our investment spreads remain stable despite the low-rate environment and tighter corporate spreads. As stated on prior calls, there are several factors contributing to our stable spreads, including our ALM discipline, use of interest rate floors, private asset originations and the performance of our variable investment income. In the quarter, pretax variable investment income was $260 million, just above the top of our 2012 quarterly guidance range. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $165 million. Next, expenses remain well controlled. Operating expenses in the quarter were $2.8 billion, up only 0.4% over the prior-year period. While the operating expense ratio did increase 30 basis points to 24.4%, the increase was primarily driven by lower revenues as a result of pension closeout sales in the third quarter of 2012. Excluding closeouts, the expense ratio would have been unchanged at 24.8% between the 2 periods. Turning to the top line revenue. Premiums, fees & other revenues, or PFOs, were $11.6 billion in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and lower pension closeouts, PFOs were up 2% year-over-year. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $47.70 as of 9/30/12. This reflects growth of 2.6% year-over-year despite the goodwill impairment and net derivative losses discussed earlier. And finally, year-to-date 2012 operating ROE was 11.4%, up 140 basis points as compared to the comparable period for 2011. This improvement was driven primarily by higher operating earnings, up $880 million on a year-to-date basis. Now let's discuss the business segments, starting with the Americas. The Americas operating earnings were $1.2 billion in the quarter, up 58% year-over-year with growth across all segments. Retail, life and other reported operating earnings of $204 million, up $83 million year-over-year due to higher net investment income. In addition, the prior year third quarter results of this business included $29 million after tax of catastrophes in excess of plan in our retail, property & casualty business and $27 million after-tax charge to increase reserves in connection with the company's use of the U.S. Social Security Administration's Death Master File to identify potential life insurance claims that had not been presented to the company. Retail annuities reported operating earnings of $288 million, up $195 million year-over-year. As noted earlier, $120 million of the variance was due to the initial market impact related to the performance of the S&P 500 in their respective quarters. In addition, this business had an increase in separate account fees, improved interest margins due to wider spreads on the general account and lower expenses. Also, I should note that variable annuity sales were $4.6 billion in the quarter, down 46% year-over-year. We continue to see sales trend down due to the pricing and derisking actions that we have taken this year. We would expect to see sales continue to decline in the fourth quarter, in line with our full 2012 guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $283 million, up $130 million year-over-year, largely due to the segment's prior year third quarter results, which included an $82 million after-tax charge related to the aforementioned Social Security Death Master File and $20 million after-tax charge for catastrophes in excess of plan in our group P&C business. In addition, this segment had favorable claim cost trends for dental, favorable catastrophe and non-catastrophe experience in group P&C, as well as improved interest and expense margins and disability. Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $303 million, up $31 million year-over-year due to higher interest margins as a result of general account asset growth and lower expenses. Spreads remained stable for this segment. Latin America reported operating earnings of $152 million, up $11 million year-over-year and 15% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were growth in Mexico and direct marketing in the region; higher net investment income, driven by growth in the general account; and a onetime tax-related benefit. Moving to the top line. The Americas' PFOs were $8.3 billion in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year, primarily due to lower pension closeouts and structured settlements. Excluding closeouts and structured settlements, PFOs would be up 3% year-over-year. The next segment, Asia, reported operating earnings of $259 million in the quarter, up $37 million or 17% year-over-year, due to premium growth in Japan and Korea, as well as higher net investment income, driven by asset growth and higher yields. PFOs for the region were up 7% or 9% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, Japan PFOs were up 9% due to an increase in life and A&H sales and improved persistency, while Korea's PFOs were up 11% due to higher fee income. In the third segment, EMEA, operating earnings were $62 million in the quarter, down $3 million year-over-year. However, on a constant currency basis, operating earnings would have been up $10 million, driven by our acquisition in Turkey and Russian credit insurance. PFOs were down 10% year-over-year and flat on a constant currency basis. The Turkey acquisition benefited the top line, which is offset by weakness in Western Europe and Greece. Finally, let me discuss our capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at September 30 totaled approximately $5.7 billion. This includes proceeds from the issuance of $750 million of 30-year senior debt, which was completed in August, which will be used to pay off maturing debt next year. I should note the balance sheet excludes the $1 billion of proceeds received in October from the remarketing and settlement of our common equity units. We also have $400 million of senior debt maturing in December, which we would expect to repay at that time. Lastly, as we announced last week, we will be paying approximately $800 million in common dividends in December. Our preliminary U.S. statutory after-tax operating earnings and U.S. statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the third quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.1 billion and $1 billion, respectively. For the 9 months of 2012, U.S. statutory after-tax operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, in line with our full year expectations. With that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.
Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: These variable annuities, still seeing very strong sales and net flows. I think a lot of investors would've preferred to see the pace of sales decelerate at a faster pace. Appreciate the comments that you made with regards to some of the steps that you're taking, but why not get significantly more aggressive in putting in place quotas, rate and prices over using guarantee rates? And then, second on Corporate Benefit Funding, one of your competitors are continuing to land large pension closeout transactions. I think a lot of us have been surprised that MET hasn't been a participant as well. So perhaps if you can explain to us why that's been the case. These deals are not hitting your hurdle rate, or are there other factors at play?
William J. Wheeler: Nigel, it's Bill Wheeler. Okay. With regard to the VA business, sales this quarter were $4.6 billion and that's probably a little misleading because we, as both Steve and John alluded to, we changed our pricing and adjusted some of our features this quarter and that resulted, I would say, in some many fire sales for lack of a better term. And so sales were a little inflated. We're -- our run rate in the fourth quarter is meaningfully below the $4.6 billion that we recorded in the third. And so we are seeing changes in that number, and that's why we're confident that we'll be at $18 billion. With regard to Corporate Benefit Funding or the closeouts, as we've talked about on a number of calls, we are seeing more large closeout activity and I expect that to continue, though the deals are lumpy and there won't necessarily be one every quarter. We are competing for that business, but we are being very disciplined about achieving our hurdle rates, something that we're doing across-the-board in all our businesses, and this is no different.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just had, first, some unsolicited feedback. I think your disclosure changes, I don't know any large company that changes its disclosure as often as you guys have done, and no one really lumps P&C products with the life insurance, so they're actually making it difficult to analyze the performance of some of your business and track them over time because these are long-term businesses. But when the disclosure changes every 3, 4 quarters, it's just hard to keep track of stuff. But the question that I have is on the international business. The results obviously have been moving around by division. Europe hasn't been that great; Asia has been strong, weak in other quarters. But maybe you could talk about how the ALICO business has done since the acquisition and where it's done better than maybe what you would have expected and where it might have not done as well. Because if you look at -- look back a year or so ago, the Asian business seems like it's actually the earnings are emerging a little bit weaker than I would have thought. And I have another question after that.
Steven A. Kandarian: Jimmy, it's Steve. ALICO is tracking what we expected. Obviously, there are some pluses and minuses country-by-country, but overall, the transaction has come in very much on plan, and we're still very encouraged about the prospects of those business long term. It's now given us exposure to markets that obviously we weren't in before that have significant growth associated with them. It increases significantly our exposure to the emerging markets. We've mentioned before that we're now up to about 14% of our profits from emerging markets, and we anticipate by 2016 that number will exceed 20% given its growth trajectory and our likelihood of doing at least some small transactions in those kinds of countries.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then another one just on interest rates. You mentioned, obviously, overall, you've -- in the past year, you've mentioned or you've expressed comfort that you can -- your results can hold up despite the rate environment. But as you indicated, corporate bond spreads coming in, new money yields probably dropping faster than you would have thought a few months ago. How much of this do you expect overall to be offset by your hedges? And if you could just give us some details on when the hedges begin to run off, is it more beginning in 2014, beginning in 2015? And then if rates do remain low, just your level of comfort with the rest of the goodwill on the balance sheet. I think it's around $10 billion, and some of that relates to businesses that are interest rate-sensitive as well.
John C. R. Hele: This is John. The -- as you can see, our spreads have held up well this year even though rates have been lower than, say, projected a year ago and that's -- you've seen the impact of the floors and the other hedges that are in place, and that's helping quite a bit this year and our spreads are -- have been maintained. So that's the good news. As you point out over time, those hedges will slowly wear off, and I think there have been various projections in the past last year that tried to project that out at a level of 2% treasury rate. And that -- those projections still stand. The impact of the other side's thinner corporate spreads, as well as other economic factors, we'll have to take into account going forward. And Steve can probably add a little more on how these wear off over time.
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: Jimmy, it's Steve Goulart. A couple of things. One, just on spreads, let me add one thing. Remember, spreads are basically at their long-term averages right now. Yes, they've tightened significantly over the course of the year, but that's from very, very wide levels. So we're not surprised at all at the levels of spreads, and we continue to practice good ALM around that. Regarding hedges, also think back to the presentations that we made earlier this year and even last year where we did show you the fact that our protection runs out for a number of years, in fact, even into the next decade. So we have a lot of protection in place, and certainly for the next several years, we're very well protected.
John C. R. Hele: Lastly, you had a question on goodwill. In the third quarter, we test all of our units with goodwill and applied the same logic and thinking that we applied to the retail annuity segment to the other segments that were also interest rate-sensitive. The most sensitive one of all, though, is the retail annuity segment and that's why the market value or the fair value was most affected by it, and the other units we still have some buffer on before we would have any issues there on the remaining $10 billion.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I wanted to pick up on the goodwill question or issue again. Can you give us a sense of sort of where you had been valuing the goodwill in terms of a multiple -- maybe multiple on book or something and kind of where you're valuing the business now? I just want to get a sense -- I know the write-down was $1.6 billion after tax, but I just want to get a sense of how you're thinking about the valuation of that business.
John C. R. Hele: Right. Well, we don't -- It's John, Suneet. We don't give out the details of this. But in reviewing the prior year's goodwill analysis, it was passing, but not by a large amount, so the price-to-book was just above from a fair value perspective, and now, it is below. And in a goodwill test, it's an assessment or trying to come with a fair value, meaning what would a -- this block or this business transact in the current environment between a willing seller and a willing buyer. It doesn't have to be a distressed price, and it doesn't have to be literally at that month or even in that quarter. But as you factor forward and think about it over the course of a year or 2 years, you have to take into account reasonable transaction prices. Given there haven't been any variable annuity blocks sold is another key factor that there's pressure on prices clearly, even though there perhaps have been some willing sellers. So you have to take all these into account and when we came up in really many different measures of it and ways of thinking about it, really, as if you were thinking of buying a block of business, people use different techniques to value businesses, including multiples, price-to-book multiples, price-to-earnings multiples, actual appraisals. We did all those and came up with a fair value that was less than our carrying value, and thus, the goodwill had to be written off.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. I mean, I guess, to follow up on that, if you're valuing the business below book value now, which is I think what you said, kind of getting back to what Nigel's line of questioning was, I mean, what does this say about your commitment to the variable annuity business and your willingness to put more capital in the business for growth when clearly the valuation of that business is not being recognized by the market?
John C. R. Hele: Well, this is John again. Let me just stress that the goodwill test is a market view. It's a fair value and it's what we believe if we tried to sell that business today, that you would be able to transact in the business today. That can be different from our long-term assumptions and how we see value over a longer period of time. There are 2 different tests. They're somewhat related. You have to make sense between the 2, but markets can over and under price true value, which is, I guess, why we all buy stocks.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then just on capital management, I realize that there's not a whole lot you can say on that, but the converts that, I guess, converted earlier this quarter, in the fourth quarter, I think there was an expectation at some point that you'd be able to repurchase those or offset that dilution. I just want to clarify, I'm assuming that, that potential is essentially the same as normal share repurchases, so we should think about your not being able to offset that dilution unless you get out of bank holding company status and get permission from the Fed. Is that a fair read?
John C. R. Hele: This is John. Until we have clarification on the future as a bank and the future being a non-bank or debanking and the future of a non-bank SIFI as well as what the rules would be under that, we can't give any guidance on capital.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne Agee.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Two questions, if you will. So following this goodwill impairment, how much equity are you now allocating to the annuity segment, and more specifically, to the VA business?
John C. R. Hele: We don't give out equity by business line.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then the second question is one more for Steve. A few months ago, I think most insurance executives, including yourselves, were getting perhaps more hopeful, if I can characterize it that way, that Fed officials and other key folks in Washington were recognizing some of these key differences between insurance companies and banks, and thus, it was looking like the stress testing for insurance companies, SIFIs might be under a different methodology than what's been applied to banks and what's been applied to you as a bank holding company. Steve, just do you have any incremental thoughts as a couple of months have passed or on any sort of more recent observations that you can share around that?
Steven A. Kandarian: John, no, I think really not a lot has changed since that point in time when I made those statements. Treasury and Fed officials have said in different settings, both in speeches and before congressional hearings, that they plan to acknowledge the difference in the business models between banks on one hand and other industries that might become non-bank SIFIs under their supervision. So those words were encouraging. But as we've mentioned, the rules have not been written. There is a draft out there. Comments have been provided back to the Fed. We provided comments, others have as well. And until this clarification around what those actual rules will be, it's very difficult to provide any sort of clarity to you and others. So we're really just standing by, waiting, monitoring. We're in discussions, where appropriate, with federal officials, but we certainly have to wait and see where all this comes out, both as to whether we become a non-bank SIFI once we dispose of our bank and debank as a holding company and then what kinds of prudential rules they put in place to regulate non-bank SIFIs should we become one.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. If I can sneak one more in, just thinking about Asia, following up maybe a little bit on Jimmy's question. On a year-to-date basis, if I sort of take those results and annualize them, it looks like Asia, overall, is tracking about 5% or more below your original guidance for 2012 for that segment, at least from an earnings perspective. Just curious as to what areas of pressure you might be seeing relative to what you were expecting and whether you expect that pressure to dissipate as you look forward.
Christopher Townsend: It's Chris Townsend here. If you look at the overall operating earnings for the quarter, we're 17% up year-on-year. You break that down to the key components, which obviously are driven by Japan and Korea. Japan's up 14% and Korea's up 52%. So Japan's performed strongly in terms of PFO growth, expense control, and Korea's up in terms of equity markets and higher surrender value. If you look at it sequentially, which is, I guess, where you're going with this, there's 2 key issues which have impacted the earnings this quarter. One is some beneficial VII that came forward in the prior quarter. And secondly, there's a number of items which are really a true-up of lapse assumptions and expense items for Japan and Hong Kong, which have impacted this quarter, which are one-off issues.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. So as we look out to the full year, I guess the question is, how do you expect the results to fare versus that original guidance? And do we just have to expect that there's a new baseline that's perhaps a little bit lower despite the strong year-over-year growth in Japan and Korea?
Christopher Townsend: Yes, I think you need to look at the broader picture. The PFO growth is very strong across the region, we're up 7%; in Japan, we're up 9%; in Korea, we're up 11%. And some of the other factors are quite beneficial for us, particularly in terms of persistency. We're up 1.5 points to 89.5 in Japan, which is a consistency, which we articulated to you at the Investor Day in Tokyo.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: I have a couple of follow-ups. First, on goodwill, just to hit that from one different angle, you mentioned in the comments that buyers may have to discount using kind of a captive or an offshore structure, and I just wanted to clarify why that would be the case. Is that due to kind of regulatory concerns that are emerging around VA runoffs?
John C. R. Hele: Randy, this is John. There are various -- some states have launched investigations and are reviewing captives. Although there's been no conclusions or points of view on this yet, we think buyers would be more cautious. Historically, some transactions we know were viewed being optimizing fully the offshore structure and others take a range. We, at MET, we do use an offshore captive, but we allocate economic capital fully against all the risks in the company. So we run at, I would say, on a conservative basis. Other buyers may take different views. And we think with these investigations underway, that buyers would be more cautious now in terms of valuing these types of businesses.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay, so it's more of the kind of a captive review. It's not necessarily kind of regulatory concerns about the insolvency fund being on the hook or something like that?
John C. R. Hele: No, not at all.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay, and then if I could, just a follow-up on the pension closeout conversation. You mentioned that some of these large blocks that have gone -- have not met your hurdle rate objective, I guess, my question is if you could clarify for us what that hurdle rate objective is and if it may be subject to change given your low-for-long rate outlook.
William J. Wheeler: Don't put words into my mouth, Randy. I didn't say -- I said we competed for that business and we have pricing discipline about, and obviously, we didn't win those closeouts, but that's the way it goes. I think there'll be more. In terms of our pricing objectives, and I think we actually talked about this on the last earnings call, we view our cost of capital today domestically as 12%. So that's our hurdle -- minimum hurdle rate. So if we don't beat 12%, we're not adding any economic value at all. We generally are trying to price business with a target of a 15% return. And you have to remember, a lot of these liabilities are going to be around for a very long time and it's important that we -- if you price it poorly, you're stuck with that for a long time. You don't get an opportunity to change the numbers a couple years from now. So that's why we're maintaining our discipline here.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Do you think as we look at these deals from the outside, is there a good rule of thumb we can think of about like the capital you would allocate to a book as a percentage of assets and liabilities? I mean, generally, and I think annuity books are kind of like 5%. I mean, is that how we should look at the capital allocation to try and get to those returns?
William J. Wheeler: It's tricky. I guess I'd hesitate to give you a rule of thumb because what we've seen already is that the mortality differences between these various blocks that have -- had transacted are quite material. You think -- you would guess sort of they're generally retirees so they would be the same, but they're not. The mortality differences were quite different, so -- and that has a pretty big impact on whether or not what the capital allocation would be. So I guess I would hesitate to give you a rule of thumb.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein from Evercore.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Actually, my first question is a follow-up for a comment or question that Suneet had. And I guess I'm just curious, back to the annuity business, the original intent behind the sales target for the year of, call it, $18 billion was to be capital-neutral in terms of the statutory capital that was allocated, at least that's my understanding. And I guess I'm just kind of curious, you've had a few quarters since that was put out, you've had some market movements. Equities up, rates volatile. Is that, in fact, holding out, or are you continuing to add capital to the annuity business?
William J. Wheeler: This is Bill. I think rate-neutral is still a fair assumption here or capital-neutral. Obviously, the business is performing better than planned, mainly because of the market environment and our sales targets are basically where they -- we expected them to be, so -- but I think neutral is still a good term for this. Just if you pull back a minute, obviously, with this low interest rate environment, the VA business, especially the in-force block, is not performing terribly well with regard to the exposure to interest rates and such. On our new sales, our new sales this quarter had a 14% ROI, and that's with a full economic capital allocation using today's environment. So we view that as pretty attractive business, and so we're being tough-minded about annuities and making sure that our risk exposure there doesn't grow too much relative to MetLife overall. But this business is profitable for us. And certainly, today's sales are profitable. And this is a consumer need, which is isn't going to go away and is a part of all our customers' financial planning as they deal with retirement. And so this is a business we like. We can't let it get too big relative to the size of MetLife. I mean, I think that's why you see the big pullback.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then, I guess, still a few. On Latin America, constant currency growth may be a little bit late. I think there may been a group case that was lost. But could you just talk a little bit about the growth outlook in Latin America and what expectations you would have for that?
William J. Wheeler: Yes, so Latin America on the surface looks like it had a pretty weak top line quarter. But of course, we did elude to the fact that sales growth was actually very good this quarter, it was up 28%, and we're seeing very strong sales. Interestingly, the strongest area of growth is in direct marketing in Latin America, and that's in a number of different countries. So top line is actually good. The premiums fees and other income this quarter are -- certainly, the currency adjustments hurt us and there were -- as you alluded to, there were a number of sort of anomalous factors. There were some group cases that didn't renew where the revenue was probably more important than the -- it was more impactful than the profits were. We had a reinsurance adjustment, which affected the top line, but didn't have a bottom line impact. So I view Latin America top line growth when you kind of parse through all that is something like 6%. That's probably a little bit -- year-over-year. That's probably still a little slower than normal. I would think -- I think of Latin America, in total, of being sort of a high single-digit revenue grower. We've certainly hit 10% in certain quarters. We probably average to something like 8% or 9%, and that would be my long-term outlook.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Smith from Scotia Capital.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division: So I want to go back to something that was stated at the ACLI's conference last week, and that was with respect to the non-bank SIFI rules that have yet to be written, there was a presentation where somebody characterized separate accounting assets as general account assets waiting to happen and that the capital ratios that some of these life insurance companies are putting up are not necessarily truly reflective of the real capital status of those companies. And I was wondering if you could comment on that and how, in your discussions with the Fed, they are talking to you about separate account assets.
John C. R. Hele: Joanne, this is John Hele. There are many discussions, of course, and submissions going on to the regulators about the future rules for non-bank SIFIs. We're participating in that as is the ACLI and other people in the industry. But as of right now, we can give no feedback or guidance on where these will end up.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division: I guess, just in terms of the comment that was made about separate account assets being general account assets waiting to happen, how do you respond to something like that?
John C. R. Hele: I wasn't there and don't have the context for all those points. The bank rules, if you strictly apply bank rules today, separate accounts are included as general accounts. We are saying they should be excluded because it makes sense from a legal structure as an insurance company. It's quite a different framework from the banking frameworks and the legal structures of banks. And that's a key point that we are making continually to the regulators, and we'll have to see where all this ends up.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets.
Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: My first question -- I have 2. My first question is probably best directed to Bill Wheeler. Bill, why are these pension closeouts taking now -- taking place now? The reason I ask is that some plans have been underfunded for a while. The supposed new accounting rules that create all this volatility on balance sheets and income statements, I don't think are new, they're 3 years old. The Pension Protection Act, which makes it harder for companies to maintain underfundedness, was passed 7 years ago. So why now on these pension closeouts, especially given the extremely low level of interest rates, which, I believe, will act as an impediment to them?
William J. Wheeler: That's a great question, Eric. We -- if you remember, and I know you do, we've been a big -- talking about large pension closeout opportunities for a long time, and of course, nothing happened until very recently. And in talking to the treasurers of companies who have these large pensions, one, they're not being -- in most cases, they're obviously not being used as a benefit anymore. Their pensions are closed and the blocks that have been closed out are on retirees, in any case. so I think what's going on is even if -- I think companies have said, you know what, I can't wait any longer for interest rates to improve. By the way, I have a very large pension obligation here. I can just start closing out pieces of it and maybe average into better interest rates over time. I also think they recognize that being a first mover here is probably a good thing. There is not an unlimited amount of capital today that's available to support pension closeout business, and I think those who feel like they go early are probably going to get better deals than those who go late. And who knows how that will play out. But I know that's the sentiment out there. So you're right. In some cases, you would think that this would not be an ideal time, but I think what's happening is companies have decided they just can't wait any longer and they should get going.
Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And with respect to the goodwill write-off or, I guess, it's not a write-down. You've written off, I believe, please correct me if I make an error here, 100% of the goodwill assigned to the retail annuity business. Why is the stock market entering into this in the sense that the stock market is -- the reason I asked the question again is that the stock market has pretty much recovered to its pre-crisis peak or is close to it. We've got a good year. Why is the current level of the stock market -- or maybe it had to do with when we've come to where we are. Why has that depressed the value of the business?
John C. R. Hele: Eric, this is John. Yes, the stock market's back up, so the equity returns, say, in the variable annuity business within the retail annuity business, overall, has recovered. When we speak of the market impact, we're speaking of how buyers view, if you had a pure annuity company, a retail annuity company traded on the stock exchange, what price to book would that be trading at today. So it's the valuations that -- of retail annuity business that would have to purchase that business. So when I refer to the market environment, I'm referring to, call it, the high betas or the low price-to-books -- lower historical price-to-books that people have today and have been here for some time on these type of business.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of John Hall from Wells Fargo.
John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And I guess since Ed's probably not going to ask a question, I might just ask a fill in about the risk-based capital for him. Could you give that out, John, please?
John C. R. Hele: John, I have to tell you that the risk-based capital calculations MET does annually, and we'll be giving that in our December forecast.
John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right, great. For Steve Goulart, the Baa assets have been moving up progressively in the fixed maturities portfolio over the course of the year. Is that because of an allocation in that direction or are you just -- or is that a result of credit changes?
Steven Jeffrey Goulart: No, that's our own action as we've looked at portfolio opportunities in this market, and we have modestly increased our BBBs. We think that's a good place to gain extra yield and still be comfortable with credit.
John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right, great. And then just lastly, Steve Kandarian, you mentioned in your comments at the outset the agreement that you have with Walmart. And it's an intriguing, I guess, venture. Could you just describe a little bit more about what you're doing there and perhaps the cost that might be associated with that? I mean, how are you going to be accessing the Walmart customer?
Steven A. Kandarian: John, as you mentioned, it's a pilot program, so it's early days. There isn't a great deal of capital associated with it at this point in time, but that obviously could grow over time as sales increase. And I really don't have much to mention at this point in time from a financial perspective because it is very much in its incipient stage. I think the most important thing here is that MetLife is going to innovate. MetLife's going to find new ways to get to market and provide these kinds of products to our customers. And we know there's a tremendous need by people in the United States to get greater coverage and protection from life insurance products. But perhaps we, as an industry, haven't made it easy enough historically for them to complete a sale, and this is one of the ways we are looking to increase participation rates out there in the public in the arena of life insurance.
John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess, what I'm asking is, is this a direct effort off of their website? Is this a kiosk in the store that's automated? Is this a person who works for MET standing there selling policies? I mean, what's the access point?
Steven A. Kandarian: It's in the store. It's more of a kiosk sort of environment. You walk in there, you'll see displays with basically like a card on there that you can go when you check out at the counter. It's prepaid, and then there are a few questions that they answer and phone calls to be made by the customer to activate the life insurance. John, we'll walk you through one if you like. We'll go with you.
John McCallion: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to give us a call in the Investor Relations, and Ed Spehar will be able to answer all your questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John McCallion, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John McCallion: All right. Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings press release, our quarterly financial supplements and in the Other Financial Information section. A reconciliation of forward-looking information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Steigerwalt, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Bill Hogan, Executive Vice President and Head of our Japan operations. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife continued to perform well in the second quarter, particularly in light of the current environment. We delivered operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, up 18% year-over-year. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, rose to $48.60, a 12% gain year-over-year. MetLife's story in the second quarter is one of sound execution on the fundamentals. Our underwriting results remain solid with strong performance in dental and improving results in disability. MetLife's commitment to underwriting discipline demonstrates that we will not chase sales at the expense of margins, which has proved over time to be a competitive strength. Consistent with our strategy of balancing growth and risk, we have reduced variable annuity sales in the quarter by 34% year-over-year and by 6% sequentially. Emerging market growth, another strategic priority, was very strong in Latin America with earnings up 5% on a reported basis and by 19% on a constant currency basis. Perhaps no area better reflects the disciplined approach we take to the business than our actions to manage interest rate exposure. As you know, we provided extensive disclosure about our interest rate risk in conjunction with the third quarter 2011 earnings call. Interest rates have come down further since then. And we have done additional analysis on the impact to MetLife's earnings. I would like to share those results with you today. The interest rate scenario we discussed last fall assumed a rate curve with a 10-year Treasury rate held flat at 2% for 5 years. We reran that scenario using a more recent yield curve with a 10-year Treasury at a record low 1.4%. The result was essentially no incremental impact on MetLife's earning per share for 2012 and 2013 and only roughly $0.05 per share in 2014. We also examined the impact of the low interest rate environment on MetLife's return on equity. At our Investor Day in May, we said we expected to have an ROE of 12% to 14% by 2016. Even if the 10-year Treasury rate were to remain at 1.4% through the end of 2016, we would expect to hit the lower end of that range, adding roughly 100 basis points of ROE from this year's expected level despite the low interest rate environment. The impact of low interest rates on MetLife's earnings is more benign than many suspect for 2 main reasons. First, we still have room to adjust credit rates on a number of our products in response to changes in interest rates. And second, our hedging program has been highly effective. We made a forward-looking call in 2004 to start buying low rate protection when the 10-year Treasury was trading above 4%. We are reaping the benefits today, and we will continue to do so for a number of years to come. Now let me discuss a few regulatory issues facing MetLife. With regard to debanking, regulatory approval for the sale of the depository business of MetLife Bank to GE Capital needs to be obtained from the FDIC. And the application for sale is pending with them. I know that investors are eager for resolution of this issue, but the timing is outside of MetLife's control. As I said last quarter, I'm not going to speculate as to when the FDIC will take final action. As soon as we have something to report, we will. Until then, we are not responding to questions about the status of the FDIC process. Looking ahead, a central regulatory issue for MetLife is whether we'll be named a nonbank systemically important financial institution and what the new prudential standards for nonbank SIFIs will look like. The Financial Stability Oversight Council has begun designating nonbank SIFIs. On July 18, FSOC applied the designation to 8 financial clearinghouses. As we have said many times, we do not believe regulated insurance activities pose systemic risk to the U.S. financial system. In the event that certain insurance companies are named SIFIs, the impact is a matter of public debate with some policy analysts focusing on the benefits and others focusing on the costs. My view is that the impact will depend on how the final prudential rules are written. So far, Federal Reserve officials have signaled their intention to adapt the rules to the unique circumstances of nonbank financial firms. In recent congressional testimony, Fed officials have said the bank-centric capital rules would likely be a bad fit for insurance companies. There is a recognition that insurance companies have different asset and liability structures than banks and that the appropriate regulation needs to take that into account. Now let me provide an update on recent M&A activity. As I've said previously, we take a portfolio view of our business, investing in markets we consider core and divesting from those that do not meet our strategic priorities or financial requirements. Earlier this week, we closed on the sale of a significant portion of our Caribbean and Central American operations to Pan-American Life Insurance Group, which was initially announced last November. Also this week, we closed on the acquisition of Aviva plc's life insurance operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania, which expands MetLife's presence in growth markets in Eastern Europe. Our views on M&A remain consistent. Any transaction we pursue must compare favorably to alternative uses of capital. Before I hand the call over to Eric, I also want to take a moment to highlight the completion of the senior executive team here at MetLife. Yesterday, Chris Townsend started as our President for Asia based in Hong Kong. Chris comes to us from Chartis, where he served as CEO of their Asia Pacific region with 4,700 employees in 15 countries. Chris has a strong background in the area of capital management and portfolio optimization, as well as the direct-to-consumer business, which is an important part of our Asia operations. And right after Labor Day, John Hele will be starting as MetLife's new CFO. John is a highly qualified Chief Financial Officer with over 30 years of broad experience in the financial services industry. He comes to us from Arch Capital Group, where he was Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Previously, he was Chief Financial Officer of ING Group, one of the largest financial services companies in the world. Earlier in his career, John spent 11 years with Merrill Lynch in investment banking, marketing and finance positions. Finally, I want to thank Eric Steigerwalt who has done an excellent job as Interim CFO. Upon the arrival of John Hele, Eric will devote himself full time to leading our Retail business and reporting to Bill Wheeler, President of the Americas division. With that, I will hand the call over to Eric.
Eric T. Steigerwalt: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, for the second quarter. This quarter's results included a few significant items, which I will discuss shortly, that benefited operating earnings by $0.02 per share. Overall, our strong results continue to demonstrate the resiliency of our businesses and our focus on pricing, underwriting and expense discipline across all of our regions. Interest margins were favorable due to strong variable investment income, which was significantly above our planned range and higher recurring net investment income. As we have stated in prior calls, we have been able to maintain strong spreads despite this low rate environment due to our ALM discipline, private origination capabilities and the effectiveness of our hedging programs. In addition, we continue to manage crediting rates prudently and have additional capacity to lower rates on our interest-rate-sensitive products. In the Americas, we saw favorable underwriting results in Non-Medical Health and had significant improvement in property/casualty as compared to the record catastrophes in the prior year quarter. We also had solid results in Latin America, particularly in Mexico and Argentina. In addition, expenses remained very much under control. Our overall expense ratio was 24.1% on a reported basis in the quarter and 23.2% when adjusting for pension and postretirement benefits. Now I'll walk you through our financial results and point out some of the highlights. First, let me discuss some significant items included in the second quarter results. Pretax variable investment income was $371 million. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $242 million, or $0.07 per share, above the top of our 2012 guidance range. This performance was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. I should remind you that we report our private equity funds on a one-quarter lag, therefore, we would expect that returns in our private equity portfolio in the third quarter will be impacted by market performance in the second quarter. In the Americas, our property & casualty business incurred catastrophe losses of $94 million after tax, which was $44 million after tax, or $0.04 per share, above our second quarter plan provision of $50 million after tax. These higher-than-expected catastrophes were partially offset by a favorable non-cat prior year development reserve release, primarily in our auto business, of $25 million after tax, or $0.02 per share. In our Asia region, operating earnings were negatively impacted by $17 million, or $0.02 per share, due to a DAC model refinement in Japan. In our EMEA region, operating earnings benefited from a $12 million after-tax, or $0.01 per share, release of negative VOBA in Greece as customers have shifted away from interest-sensitive pension products to products with more liquidity. And finally, our Corporate & Other segment had 2 individual items, which each negatively impacted earnings by a little over $0.01 per share. These items relate to expenses from our efficiency initiative and our Japan JV run-off book of business. Now let's take a look at the results in the quarter by region. For the Americas, reported operating earnings were $1.1 billion for the second quarter, up 11% versus the prior year quarter. The primary drivers for this earnings growth were in our Retail and Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits segments. The Retail segment reported operating earnings of $380 million for the second quarter, up 14% as compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by the annuity segment. Operating earnings for annuities were $226 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year as the business continues to enjoy strong core spreads, higher fee income due to separate account asset growth and lower expenses, partially offset by market true-ups in the quarter. Deferred annuity spreads, as reflected in our quarterly financial supplement, were 301 basis points in the quarter, down modestly from the record spreads in the first quarter but up 44 basis points year-over-year. This improvement was due mainly to higher derivative income, primarily from interest rate floors, as well as lower crediting rates. Our Group, Voluntary and Worksite segment reported operating earnings of $295 million for the quarter, up 29% versus the prior year quarter, driven by the Non-Medical Health and property/casualty businesses. Non-Medical Health reported operating earnings of $133 million in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year, mainly on improved underwriting earnings across the product set. The Non-Medical Health benefit ratio for the quarter was 86.1%, a 140-basis-point improvement in the ratios compared to the prior year quarter of 87.5% and well within our expectations. In dental, our underwriting trends remain favorable as a result of stable utilization combined with our disciplined pricing strategy. Also, disability results improved due to a lower LTD incidence rate compared to the prior year quarter and plan. However, recoveries, while better than the prior year, continued to remain below plan in the second quarter. Property & casualty operating earnings were $44 million in the quarter, up $100 million versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower catastrophes as compared to the record prior year levels. That said, pretax catastrophe losses of $144 million were above our plan. The combined ratio for property & casualty was 102.3%, or 83.4% excluding catastrophes in the quarter. This result was significantly better than the combined ratio of 121.7%, or 85.9% excluding cats in the second quarter of 2011. Latin America operating earnings were $135 million, up 5% year-over-year. On a constant rate basis, operating earnings were up 19% due to business growth across the region, operating synergies and higher investment yields. Also, underwriting results were favorable to plan, primarily in Mexico. We expect underwriting in Latin America to continue to be favorable for the balance of the year. Mortality results in the U.S. were modestly unfavorable in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Group life's loss ratio for the quarter was 87.3%, higher than the very strong prior year quarter of 82.1% but right within our expectations. Retail life's mortality ratio was 85.6% in the quarter, higher than the prior year quarter of 84.4%. However, reinsurance recoveries were better in the quarter, resulting in an improvement of overall underwriting results year-over-year. Premiums, fees and other revenues for the Americas were $8.4 billion, down 1% from the prior year quarter. Higher separate account fees and retail annuities, solid dental premiums in Non-Medical Health were offset by lower pension closeouts. In Non-Medical Health, results this quarter reflect nearly $100 million of premiums from the TRICARE Dental contract, which became effective May 1. Also, in Latin America, while revenues were up 1% year-over-year, they were up 13% on a constant rate basis, driven by growth in accident and health and strong immediate annuity sales. Now let me turn to the Asia region. Operating earnings in the Asia region were $275 million, up 61% from $171 million in the prior year quarter and up 25% after adjusting for onetime items, most notably $44 million of higher claims and expenses in the second quarter of 2011 as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. We are seeing solid growth in new business in Japan, as well as strong persistency gains year-over-year, particularly for accident and health products. Premiums, fees and other revenues in Asia were $2.3 billion, up 6% from the prior year quarter on both the reported and constant rate basis. Growth was driven by new business in Japan and persistency gains in both Japan and Korea. In addition, total sales for the region grew 13%, driven by Japan, which was up 33% year-over-year, as well as strong growth in China and Australia. For the region, key product drivers were life and accident and health sales in Japan and A&H sales in China, as well as group sales in Australia. In EMEA, operating earnings were $82 million, up 28% from the second quarter of 2011 and up 46% on a constant rate basis. This increase was due to expense improvements, business growth in several countries and the benefit of a onetime item in the quarter that I discussed earlier. EMEA premiums, fees and other revenues were $815 million, down 4% versus the prior year quarter on a reported basis and up 3% on a constant rate basis. Finally, EMEA sales grew 13% compared to the second quarter of 2011, driven by Turkey, credit life sales in Russia and strong sales in our Gulf countries. This is a solid result despite the challenging market conditions across the region. Now let me turn to investments. Let's start with our realized investment gains and losses. In the second quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net gains of $4 million. Included in this net gain were impairments of $36 million after-tax. We expect investment portfolio net losses to remain relatively modest for the remainder of the year. Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform well. As of June 30, our valuation allowance was $300 million, down from $368 million at the end of the first quarter. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 59% from 60% as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, as of June 30, there were no delinquent loans in the portfolio and no losses recorded during the quarter on this $41 billion portfolio. Finally, with respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax gains of $1.3 billion that were driven primarily by lower interest rates and the impact of MetLife's credit spreads. As a reminder, derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company. Now let me discuss the balance sheet and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at June 30 totaled approximately $5.3 billion, which is on track with our 2012 guidance. This includes a $1.5 billion residual capital remittance from our Japan operation in May as it converted from a branch to a subsidiary, offset by the deployment of $397 million as we repaid senior debt that matured in June. Our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis was 847% as of March 31, 2012, and well above our target ratio of 600%. Due to accounting rules, this included the effect of the plan residual capital remittance, which was largely offset by a surplus relief transaction that occurred in the first quarter. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our U.S. stat earnings and capital position. Our preliminary second quarter 2012 statutory operating earnings and net income for our domestic insurance companies were approximately $230 million and $630 million, respectively. The results were impacted by higher reserves related to the market performance in the quarter. While reserve adjustments go through the income statement, the hedges in our derivatives portfolio do not go through the income statement but instead are reflected in unrealized gains. Therefore, our total adjusted capital, or TAC, increased by $2.1 billion in the quarter, primarily due to unrealized gains on derivatives and other invested assets, and now stands at approximately $30 billion as of June 30. For the first 6 months of 2012, statutory operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. In conclusion, MetLife had another very good quarter. Our margins remain strong as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth through pricing, underwriting, expense and investment discipline. As a result, we have been able to grow earnings, maintain a strong balance sheet and capital position in a very challenging environment. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator so we can take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Question, I guess, for Steve. On the capital, I appreciate that you can't really talk about what the Fed and the FDIC might do, but this is a management team that's always been sort of planning for contingencies. And as we think about the capital that's building here, I think you're pretty much on track as you said in terms of where you're going to be at the end of the year. If you can't return capital to shareholders, what is Plan B in terms of redeploying that capital? I mean, does M&A all of a sudden become a lot more compelling? And do you think there's opportunities out there or anything in the pension transfer market? I mean, just kind of get a sense of what's going to happen to this capital that's clearly building and is not needed for your core business right now?
Steven A. Kandarian: I think it's premature for me to say that we'll do one thing or another. We're still working hard to de-bank and be able to take capital actions. In terms of M&A, I wouldn't say that if we have interim period where we can't return capital or raise our dividend that, that somehow changes our analysis around whether we should buy or not buy a company that's for sale at some price. So I would still look at it as -- it needs to be accretive to earnings. We're not going to let our standards slip based upon our inability in the short term to return capital to our shareholders above the current levels of our dividend.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: That's great. But is there anything out there that you're seeing versus, perhaps, the last time you spoke to us in terms of M&A opportunities? Or is it pretty much the same?
Steven A. Kandarian: As you know, we look at most anything that is in our general scope of businesses we're in currently. And I'm sure you're aware there are number of properties today for sale. I anticipate there'll be a number of other properties available for sale in the coming months and years as well, particularly in light of capital rules in Europe and elsewhere. So we're remaining disciplined. I think MetLife has proven over the years that we don't get caught up in the frenzy of the moment in terms of buying properties. And I've said before that we're not going to adjust our standards around what is a good transaction or not a good transaction, either strategically or in terms of pricing of a deal based upon what the competition is doing. We're going to remain disciplined, and we're confident that we can, over time, make appropriate acquisitions at prices that make sense for our shareholders.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then my follow-up question or second question is for Bill Wheeler. Obviously, the underwriting results in the Americas were strong. I think we're seeing some mixed results from some of your peers. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of pricing, particularly in some of the group insurance lines and if you think that kind of what you're seeing in the market is truly reflective of the current interest rate environment or are people sort of pricing based on an expectation that eventually rates will rise? Just any color there would be helpful.
William J. Wheeler: Sure. Well, you kind of mixed 2 ideas there. In terms of sort of group underwriting, I would say that the environment is clearly better. And there are number of people, I think, who were probably too aggressive. I think they're -- it's caught up with them and their results. And so I think they're showing a lot more discipline now, and that's just good for us. And I think the other thing, too, obviously, is that our underwriting discipline over the last couple of years, the contrast is pretty stark with some of our peers. So I think that's good. In terms of interest rates and how that might be influencing pricing, we've seen yet another kind of dip here in interest rates from the 10-year Treasuries sort of the 2-ish range down to 1.5. I think that I'm not sure everybody's caught up yet with that reality in terms of their pricing. And so I would guess you're going to see more pricing adjustments coming from the industry because of it. I think when interest rates get this low, obviously, that really starts to pressure ROIs, product sales. But it takes a little bit of time, I think, for pricing to adjust. And I'm sure some people probably think that, "Gee, I'll just wait and I'm sure it will get better. How could it possibly get lower?" But I think people have been making -- saying that line for quite a while, and now it's not come true. So we view this as an opportunity, obviously, to change prices if we need to in certain areas. And we've been pretty -- pricing pretty aggressively in places like UL. And obviously, the variable annuity business for quite some time now. And that's had an effect on our sales levels there, but I think that makes good sense to do.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I was hoping -- maybe for Bill. I was hoping we could revisit the slide from your Investor Day and get a sense for how things maybe have or haven't changed given the first half of the year results. And the slide I'm referring to is the one that showed sort of 3 different categories of return on equity with a bunch of different businesses categorized in 15% or greater, 10% to 15% and then under 10%, and in particular, focus on the group disability and the annuity business, both of which were under 10%. I'm wondering if there's been any change there.
William J. Wheeler: I think with regard to the annuity business, the answer is probably no. But our new product sales ROIs in this quarter, even with relatively low interest rates, we calculate our ROI to be about high-13s as an average for the quarter. Probably by the end of the quarter, given where interest rates had moved to, it would probably move to something more like 13%. But we're changing some more of our features on our VAs. We're changing, altering the dollar-for-dollar feature, which I think will improve the ROI in the out quarters. So it's a big block. So it's hard to move the overall ROE there. But new product pricing is good. Secondly, with regard to disability, our book is really starting to turn. And you can see that. In terms of our underwriting results and the profitability of it, again, this is in pretty stark contrast to most of our peers in the group disability business who -- and I'm hard-pressed to actually explain why, but our book is different than theirs. And if you've been aggressive, I think you're getting punished for it. But incidence rates are down. Claim closure rates are still elevated. And so we're -- so underwriting isn't yet where it should be or could be, we think, in the future. But clearly, the ROE of that book is improving.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: And Bill, just as a quick follow-up on that, I mean, in the group disability business, what does -- how do we think about 100 basis points of loss ratio improvement there? How much does that move the ROE, roughly?
William J. Wheeler: I'm not sure off the top of my head. Crudely, something like 1 point.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then separately, I guess a question for Eric. Just thinking about Asia and EMEA, those are the 2 other primary segments where I don't think we really have any strong or any real idea what the ROEs are today. Can you give us some sense?
Eric T. Steigerwalt: That's an interesting question, John. We have not been giving any returns out on the segments, as you know. We've been working through our economic capital that is associated with how we allocate equity. The returns, I would say, in both of those operations are quite good, but I'm not going to give out a number.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. And -- understood. Maybe some further disclosure going down the road. Last one, just a quick one, given the severity of drought conditions, is there any reason we should be thinking about potential losses on the agricultural mortgage portfolio?
Steven J. Goulart: John, it's Steve Goulart. The answer is no. I mean, we've obviously been following that closely in our portfolio, but we don't think it would have any material impact. And also remember, an advent in that market has been crop insurance over the last few years. So most of our borrowers are insured through their crop insurance programs as well. But we don't think it will have any material impact on us.
Operator: [Audio Gap] Bank of America.
Unknown Analyst: I think this question is for Steve Kandarian. There is a debate about whether GAAP or statutory will be the basis for regulation of insurance companies if they are designated nonbank SIFIs. And I'm just wondering, is it reasonable to assume that the bank capital model framework that underpins the CCAR analysis would be a workable model for life insurers as long as there are revisions to how separate accounts are treated, the capital charges are designed to appropriately reflect the risk of corporates and just that there's generally a clear understanding that derivatives are used exclusively to hedge economic risks and approach that can introduce, I guess, what we would call uneconomic outcomes on a GAAP basis from quarter to quarter?
Steven A. Kandarian: So we've said that our feeling is that the RBC framework really makes the most sense in terms of regulating the industry. Obviously, there's improvements that have been made to the RBC framework over a number of years. There could be further improvements made, but we think that's the best way to look at the risks in our industry. If it is decided that insurance companies are deemed as being systemically risky, then the framework will come out of the Federal Reserve. At this point in time, we really don't have a great deal of insight as to how they will sort all that out. If they use more of a bank framework with a modification, we'll have to see the details of that to determine whether or not we think that is an appropriate way to regulate a company like ours. They have made statements on the record out of Washington at the most senior levels of the Fed, the Treasury that a purely banking model would not make sense in terms of regulating the insurance industries. So those are favorable comments from our perspective. But again, the details are going to be the key here, and those details have not been sorted out. They have not been finalized. It's very early days on the details of the regulatory framework, if there is one for us.
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And my follow-up is for Bill Wheeler on the interest rate assumption behind product pricing. Bill, I think you mentioned that VA marginal returns, it sounds like, came down only slightly during the quarter despite a material decline in the 10-year Treasury yield. Did I hear that correctly? And if I did, I mean, I guess that's implying that this product is not nearly as interest-sensitive, maybe, as some people anticipate?
William J. Wheeler: Well, okay. So first, you used the phrase -- word marginal. I just need to correct you. There's nothing -- our -- these are not marginal returns. These are fully allocated, fully costed returns on the product.
Unknown Analyst: I'm sorry, I meant marginal as meaning new business returns.
William J. Wheeler: No, I know. It's just we were good to capture [ph] it. I took the opportunity. Well, look, they're obviously somewhat interest-rate sensitive. But remember now, the underlying guarantees and the minimum interest rates for annuitization are still very low. I think the minimum annuitization right now is 1% in the guarantees. So even though, yes, they came down, there's still a cushion there, obviously. And there's a lot of parts of the economics of these products. It isn't all about the guarantee, of course. The base fee itself is very profitable. So sure, there's been -- when I say there's no interest rate sensitivity, a couple of quarters ago or 2 quarters ago, the ROI here was in the 15s or higher. So we have seen it tick down. I'm not real happy with high 13s, but I think given where interest rates are, that's pretty good. So there's been some sensitivity, but the point of it is this is still a product which earns above our cost of capital. And so we think we're still adding value with each sale. And that's the most important thing.
Unknown Analyst: And just one quick one on the life side. If you were to look at the appropriate -- what you would view to be the appropriate pricing of interest-sensitive individual life products, I know that's a broad category, but how much do prices have to change if we were to assume 1.5% 10-year Treasury versus 2.5%? Is that a very significant change given how the products are already designed with the minimums that are in place today?
William J. Wheeler: I think it's a reasonably significant change. We just priced one of our interest-rate sensitive products. One of those interest-rate sensitive products, we raised prices 15%. Okay. Now that was not just in the last -- based on interest rates in the last couple of quarters, but it's, I mean -- but we've -- pricing in the UL category has been moving up aggressively now for a couple of years, and I don't think that's going to stop.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Mark Finkelstein from Evercore Partners.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I guess I'll ask the somewhat obvious follow-up, which is, are there any capital impacts with this lower rate as you look out to 2016, above and beyond what you kind of told us in your interest rate disclosures at this lower rate?
Eric T. Steigerwalt: Mark, it's Eric. So let's just review the bidding on what we did previously. We said that in the last interest rate presentation that Steve referred to, that we would have no stat reserve strengthening but that we expected to have modest actions year after year after year. We said there'd be no GAAP loss recognition in the U.S. We said we'd probably have, let's call it, $400 million to $450 million after-tax impact on DAC mostly occurring in the back end of that 5-year outlook. And we said there's potential pressure on Retirement Products goodwill. So at this point, and I'm just going to make a blanket statement here, anything I say here is going to be subject to what we learn in actual testing, okay, which is beginning, both for CFT, loss recognition, goodwill testing, et cetera, okay? So having said that, I think maybe the change here would be, I feel compelled to say that, modest stat reserves strengthening could be required if rates stay low. For GAAP loss recognition, as we think about it from the point of view of August 1 here, August 2, whatever date this is, we don't see a lot of loss recognition in the near term. But again, we'll have to see what happens as we go through testing. We still don't see, given our current methodology, a big DAC impact in the next couple of years. And I would certainly then finally add that there remains pressure on our goodwill, specifically for the Retirement Products. We're starting goodwill testing now, and we'll have to see where we come out as we get to the end of the year here. So I'm increasing it, using the word modest, but always subject to what we learn as we go through all the various tests.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. Question on Corporate Benefit Funding and I guess more directly on the pension closeout market. Obviously, you saw PRU do a big transaction in the quarter. AIG has talked more constructively about this market. And I'm interested in how you're thinking about, one, the opportunities with pension closeouts; and two, I guess how you're thinking about the opportunity in terms of capital deployment that can be larger transactions, but on the other hand, it also adds significant assets to equity leverage. So if you could just kind of comment on the opportunities and broadly how you're thinking about that business now.
William J. Wheeler: Sure, Mark. I think you framed it out really well. The General Motors transaction, I think it's fair to view that as a bit of a catalyst. I think that's causing other corporate treasurers of large traditional companies with old traditional pension plans to think hard about what they should be doing. And certainly, there's a lot more conversation now than there was pre-GM. My expectation -- but the can of that, of course, is interest rates keep ticking down. And I think that makes pension closeouts more difficult. So there's contrary trend influences there. But I do think you'll see more deals, more big deals, despite the low interest rates. In terms of how we're approaching it, each -- a big pension closeout is a big sort of one-off transaction. It's not unfair to think of it like a big M&A deal. It's a large transfer of assets. So the capital considerations there are significant. And so we, just like an M&A deal or anything else, which is a big capital transaction, have to evaluate that capital that would get allocated to that deal versus other alternatives that are available to the company. We will not do a big closeout just so we can print a big deal, okay? If it doesn't add shareholder value and get us the right kind of returns on our capital, we will not do it. And so that's got to be our discipline. And look, I think our track record about having -- being disciplined about those kind of decisions is pretty good. So that's got to be how we look at it.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then finally just a follow-up on annuities. When do you expect the pricing changes that you've announced, including, I guess, changes to the dollar-for-dollar withdrawal benefit to be implemented and would the IRRs on the product at this rate environment be pushed over 500% -- or 15% with those changes?
William J. Wheeler: So the dollar-for-dollar adjustment, I think, it was implemented in August. I think there are other changes we're making. Some of those are occurring this month. So I guess we're in August, so technically I meant some were implemented in July. So I don't think the dollar-for-dollar change, given where interest rates are, will push it back to 15%. But it will push it, I think, closer to 14%.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: But the overall changes, do you get over 15%?
William J. Wheeler: Well, no. The other changes won't necessarily improve the ROI, but they'll -- because they are more about the in-force. So it's the ROI on new sales.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Most have been asked. I guess a question for Bill Wheeler on Latin American business. I mean, this is obviously a region that you guys like. I think you want to get bigger here given that you didn't get a lot kind of with the Alico acquisition. But I guess how are you thinking about the opportunity there given the decline in short-term rates, how they've moved noticeably lower? And does that really kind of begin to push consumers to begin to kind of venture closer to the products that you guys are offering in that region?
William J. Wheeler: I think in most of the countries, our interest rates -- the interest rates aren't having, I would say, a big impact on our insurance sales. I think the one area where you see this phenomenon where it's a real trade-off between an insurance product and a bank deposit is in Brazil. And we're not really very much in that where insurance products obviously have a sort of a built-in interest rate. We're not very heavy into that market, and we're certainly not trying to compete with those kinds products. Latin America, the reason Latin America is really attractive to us is it's all about an emerging middle class that are first-time purchasers of life insurance. So life insurance as a percentage of GDP is growing very nicely, and then GDP itself is growing nicely. And there are markets that are developing. Our fastest-growing segments in Latin America right now are in direct marketing, okay, which, obviously, has nothing to do with interest rates, really. It's all about the channel management and driving growth. In general, I would tell you that we really do like Latin America. Obviously, it's a big segment for us. The returns are very good. The growth rates are good. Our top line growth adjusting for currency was 13% this quarter. We have very good management teams down there. They're seasoned. And our market position, we're #1 in 4 different -- 4 of the 6 Latin American countries we participate in. So we're very well positioned. So obviously, it's an area where there will be a lot of emphasis going forward.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then maybe a question for Steve Goulart. Given the challenge to find yield, and I guess coupled with the challenge to deploy, some of the capital that you guys have, curious if you're at all enticed by the yields in Europe and if you'd consider putting more money to work there to offset some of the low rates -- low new money rates you guys are seeing?
Steven J. Goulart: Well, I think we've always been a pretty conservative investor. And it's always most important to make sure that we can pay off our liabilities. So we're always looking for relative value propositions, but I don't think we're comfortable with, by and large, what you see in peripheral Europe. Just given our European portfolios though, we continue to invest in Europe, but they tend to be in the safer economies and in very strong corporates.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of John Hall with Wells Fargo.
John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: In Bill's commentary, he mentioned cost of capital. And I was just wondering, what is it that you consider to be your cost of capital? And in that construct, what are you using in considering your beta as right now?
William J. Wheeler: That's a very interesting question. So maybe I'll talk a little bit. Maybe I'll let Mr. Kandarian -- because this is obviously -- this a big focus inside MetLife right now. So I would just say our cost of capital, I would say, in general, sort of the rule of thumb we're looking at in terms of how we price products is roughly 12%. And that's sort of a blended cost of capital across all products. And that's obviously up over what we -- I would think most people would have said what it was a couple of years ago. So when we price products, if they don't, in our minds, if they don't earn at least 12%, we think we're destroying value. And so that's how -- that's guiding us in our pricing. But in terms of sort of the general philosophy on where we are, I'll let Steve do that.
Steven A. Kandarian: Hi, John. We look at this very closely. We've talked about it internally in terms of not just product pricing but overall strategy at MetLife. And say our -- if you kind of impute a cost of capital to MetLife's equity right now, it's higher than the 12% number that Bill just referred to, and we believe that is a temporary level of equity capital cost to us. And we have to really look at this in a longer time frame because basically, right now, the markets are very volatile, probably driven by things like low rates, obviously, for our industry, regulatory overhang for larger insurers and so on. And that's driven up the perception in the marketplace about what our beta is. And it certainly is now closer to a 2 beta as opposed to historical norm closer to 1 or 1.1. So as we think about our business, I wouldn't, for example, on the flip side say if our beta drops just hypothetically to below 1, let's say 0.6 or something, that all of a sudden, we're going to print a bunch of business at 8%. We wouldn't think that would be the prudent thing to do longer term. Similarly, if things are spiking up because of near-term volatility out there, we have to kind of look past that at a short timeframe. So Bill gave you the answer about how we're looking at our products right now, but clearly, our cost of capital is higher than historical because our beta is significantly higher than the historical 1.1x that we've seen.
John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And just sort of a follow-up, and this is going out the plank a little bit. Say MetLife is designated nonbank SIFI. What effect do you think that would have on your cost of capital?
Steven A. Kandarian: John, I think it depends on what the rules look like. And analysts have looked at this both ways and said, "On the positive side, you get the good housekeeping seal of approval of the federal government. You're too big to fail. You're safe to do business with. It could lower your beta is one theory." The flip side is there could be very harsh rules around the regulation and capital requirements, and that can make you unattractive in some ways. That could raise your cost of capital. And 2 of the rules are written. I think it's just we're all speculating as to the ultimate impact. What we have said, certainly, on the record is that we don't think that we really should fall under Dodd-Frank in this regard and should not be designated systemic. But if we are so designated, let's be sure these rules really are appropriate for the risks of our company.
Operator: And our last question of the day comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher with Credit Suisse.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: First question was just on the interest rate impact guidance. Is the reason -- I guess this should be for Eric. Is the reason the incremental drop in rates has essentially minimal impact on EPS for the next 3 years because your initial guide was conservative enough and that it didn't assume much benefit from lowering crediting rates but now you are? Or can you help us get to kind of what's behind those assumptions?
Eric T. Steigerwalt: Look, these are big exercises. So obviously, everything is thought about within a range. And when we went out with that guidance, we thought we had a reasonable range here. And now that we've done a refresh of this, I think it kind of confirms what we thought previously and now just simply adds to that. Now we've got a couple of things going on here. We always thought when we made that presentation last year that we would -- that we not only had room in crediting rates but that we would take advantage of that if rates continue to decline. That's number one. In some of our portfolios, I think we're probably better cash flow matched than anybody externally would actually think. Third, we've got a lot of interest rate protection. We've got all of these floors and swaptions and swaps that we've talked about. Floor income year-over-year is meaningful and could continue to be meaningful depending on if rates stay here or, frankly, even if they went a little bit lower. I guess I'll give you a sense because I've know we've talked about it this publicly. Like in our UL block, 1/3 of that block is at minimum guarantees. So here where we are today, end of the second quarter, 1/3 of the block is at minimum guarantees. I don't know what you would have thought that number was, but that means, obviously, we've got 2/3 to go. It's in the 70% range on the general account annuity blocks. And so putting all of those things together, the impact from where we were to here is minimal.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Got it. And just 2 quick follow-ups, if I could. Eric, you had mentioned Retirement Products goodwill potentially comes under scrutiny, I guess, at year end. Can you remind us how big that is?
Eric T. Steigerwalt: $1.7 billion.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, we're starting to see some of your competitors in long-term care, obviously, having some pressure because of low rates, and that's just mechanical. But in addition to that, you're also seeing adverse claims trends. I'm curious what you guys are seeing because I think generally you have a newer vintage book. But can you comment at all on what you're seeing on long-term care and sort of the outlook for that business?
Eric T. Steigerwalt: Well, Bill would like to do that one.
William J. Wheeler: I just want to prove I know. Let me start by saying just to remind everyone, we exited the long-term business a couple of years ago. There was a modest tick-up in claims activity this quarter, so underwriting results were down a little bit. But it wasn't very material. In terms of kind of managing the block, I used the word immunized it loosely, but we put in some very long-term interest rate swaps that are in that block to kind of really protect ourselves from just this sort of scenario. So we think we're managing interest rates really well there. That said, it's possible that there might need to be some stat. We might add the stat reserves. We have done that historically, I think you know, not necessarily because we absolutely had to but because we were starting to get close to the line. So we've been making installment payments. So all along the way in terms of long-term care, and I think that's been prudent. And the way that things have played out, it's really prudent. So we're in good shape, I think.
John McCallion: Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And have a great rest of the day. I'll turn it back to you, Brad.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and products of the company and its subsidiaries.  MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.  With that, I would like to turn the call over to John McCallion, Head of Investor Relations.
John McCallion: Thank you, Marla, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. We'll be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings press release, our quarterly financial supplements and in the other financial information section. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.  Also, please note that our -- that the financial results for this quarter and all prior periods reflect our new reporting structure, as well as the adoption and retrospective application of the new DAC accounting guidance. In addition, as provided in our earnings press release, we have recast our 2012 projected operating earnings by segment to align with the company's new financial reporting structure. In doing so, we have neither affirmed nor updated our 2012 projections, which were originally provided on December 5, 2011.  Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Steigerwalt, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also, here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Bill Hogan, Executive Vice President and Head of our Japan operations.  With that, I would like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that MetLife delivered strong financial results in the first quarter. We had healthy top line growth with premiums, fees and other income rising by 7% year-over-year. Our bottom line performance was even stronger. MetLife generated operating earnings of $1.5 billion or $1.37 per share, up 11% year-over-year. MetLife's performance during the quarter was driven by some fundamentals in the core earnings power of our diversified global portfolio of businesses.  Eric will discuss our segment results in greater detail. I wanted to provide a high-level overview of how each of our major geographic divisions is performing. Our businesses in the Americas, which consists of the United States, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay, performed very well in the first quarter. In our U.S. business, operating earnings were up 12% year-over-year, driven by strong underwriting, improving core spreads and rising equity markets.  Variable annuity sales in the first quarter were down 13% year-over-year and 32% sequentially to $4.9 billion, consistent with our expectations. As a reminder, our target range for VA sales in 2012 is $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. While our annualized first quarter sales put us slightly above the top end of the range, our expectation is that the product and pricing actions we have taken will result in sales within the target range.  In Latin America, operating earnings were up 22% year-over-year, driven by growth across the region and improved underwriting results. The region saw a very strong sales growth in accident and health, credit insurance and retirement products. In Mexico, our largest Latin American market, underwriting results for life products remained highly favorable, although increased competition could pressure growth going forward.  In Asia, which consists of Japan, South Korea, Australia, Hong Kong and China, our businesses delivered growth in operating earnings of 33% year-over-year. In Japan, our second largest market, sales were up 28% year-over-year with all distribution channels growing by double digits. Australia and China saw very strong sales growth, although off a smaller base. Total sales in Asia were up 15% while premiums, fees and other revenues were up 8%.  In our EMEA region, which consists of 35 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and South Asia, operating earnings were down 4% year-over-year, primarily due to unfavorable exchange rates and a challenging economic environment in Europe. Premiums, fees and other revenues were up 9% year-over-year.  At our last Investor Day in December of 2011, I noted that one of MetLife's guiding principles is to continuously reassess our strategy, especially given the rapidly changing external environment. That is why we conducted strategic reviews in 2007 and 2009 and began another in 2011. Over the last several years, MetLife has built a solid foundation to deliver value for our customers, shareholders, employees and the communities in which we operate. Our strategic review has focused on developing a clear roadmap for creating shareholder value.  At our next Investor Day on May 23, you will hear further detail on many of the themes I've been emphasizing for the past year, taking a portfolio view of our business, treating capital as precious, avoiding growth for growth's sake and earning above our long-term cost of capital. An example of these principles in action is our decision to manage VA sales to appropriate levels. I look forward to talking with you more about the tremendous opportunities ahead.  Now let me turn to MetLife's capital position and plan. MetLife is a financially strong company. At the end of 2011, the combined risk-based capital ratio for our U.S. life insurance companies was 450%, and the solvency margin ratio for our Japan business was 880%.  As you know, we are selling the depository business of MetLife Bank to GE Capital, which is a critical step in our ceasing to be a bank holding company. This action will put us on a level playing field with our insurance company peers. Once regulatory approval has been granted and the transaction closes, our deregistration as a bank holding company is expected to follow shortly thereafter. The actual timing of these events could vary based on the regulatory review process.  Yesterday, MetLife also announced that we are exiting the reverse mortgage business. Nationstar Mortgage LLC will acquire MetLife Bank's reverse mortgage servicing portfolio subject to regulatory approval, and then MetLife -- and MetLife Bank will no longer accept new reverse mortgage loan applications and registrations.  Earlier, we announced the sale of our warehouse finance business and the discontinuation of our forward mortgage origination business. Together, these actions will allow MetLife to maintain its strategic focus as a global insurance employee benefits leader.  We received a number of questions regarding whether we will be designated a nonbank systemically important financial institution by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Let me say first that we do not believe traditional, regulated insurance activities generate or amplify systemic risk to the U.S. economy. However, in the event that FSOC names MetLife and other large insurers as SIFIs, it will be essential to tailor the new prudential rules to the insurance industry. We are discussing with policymakers the appropriate regulatory framework for nonbank SIFIs, and we are urging that the new rules reflect the unique asset and liability characteristics of insurers.  On the issue of returning capital to shareholders, our first step is to complete the process of de-banking. Once that has occurred, we will examine a range of factors, including the state of the global economy, MetLife's earnings and capital position and the regulatory outlook in the United States, including the potential shape of the Federal Reserve's prudential regulations for nonbank SIFIs. Based on these considerations, we will bring a recommendation on capital deployment to our board of directors. As a reminder, any specific announcement with regard to our dividend will be made in October as usual.  Let me close by restating my belief that MetLife is well positioned for profitable growth today and into the future. We are aligning the company both strategically and operationally to achieve that growth, and I look forward to sharing with you on May 23 the results of our latest work.  Thank you, again, for joining us this morning. And with that, I will turn the call over to Eric Steigerwalt.
Eric T. Steigerwalt: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.5 billion or $1.37 per share for the first quarter. This quarter's results included a few onetime items, which I will discuss shortly, that depressed operating earnings by $0.02 per share.  Overall, I would characterize this as a very good quarter, well above our plan, driven by strong interest in underwriting margins, as well as solid growth within all regions, as total company premiums, fees and other revenues grew to $11.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. The quarter also benefited from favorable market performance.  Interest margins were favorable, primarily due to higher recurring investment results but also from variable investment income, which came in at the high end of our planned range. Over time, the general level of spreads will come down if interest rates remain at their current levels. However, as we have discussed previously, we have been able to maintain strong spreads in this environment as a result of our ALM discipline, private origination capabilities and the use of derivatives.  In the Americas, we saw favorable underwriting results in our Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits segment, particularly in the nonmedical health and property/casualty businesses, as well as in Latin America. In addition, expenses remained very much under control. Our overall, expense ratio was 25.2% on a reported basis in the quarter and 24.2% when adjusting for pension and post-retirement benefits. While the new DAC accounting rules elevate the expense ratio, our underlying discipline around expenses remains very much intact.  Now I'll walk you through our financial results and point out some highlights. First, let me discuss some onetime items which occurred during the first quarter. As a result of a multistate examination and settlement payment related to unclaimed property and MetLife's use of the Social Security Death Master File, retail life incurred a $26 million after tax or $0.02 per share charge related to the expected acceleration of benefit payments to policyholders while our Corporate & Other segment incurred a $26 million after tax or $0.02 per share charge related to the examination payment. This was partially offset by the following favorable onetime items in the quarter, which impacted operating earnings by $22 million after tax or $0.02 per share.  In our Asia region, operating earnings were favorably impacted by $12 million after tax due to an accident and health reserve release in Japan. Our property and casualty business had a favorable prior year development reserve release in its auto business of $4 million after tax and incurred catastrophe losses of $17 million after tax, which was $3 million below our first quarter plan provision of $20 million after tax. And finally, our Corporate & Other segment had a few additional onetime items that benefited earnings by a net $3 million after tax.  Now let's take a look at the results in the quarter by region. In the Americas, reported operating earnings were $1.2 billion for the first quarter, up 13% versus the prior year quarter of $1 billion. The primary business drivers for this earnings growth were in retail annuities, property and casualty and Latin America.  Retail annuities operating earnings were $282 million, up 37% year-over-year, as the business experienced favorable market performance and strong investment spreads. As a result of the S&P 500 being up almost 12% in the quarter, retail annuities had an initial market impact on operating earnings of $38 million after tax due to favorable DAC and SOP 03-1 true-ups. Deferred annuity spreads, as reflected in our quarterly financial supplement, achieved a record of 309 basis points in the quarter, driven by core earned rates from higher fixed income yields, higher derivative income and lower credit rates.  Property/casualty operating earnings were $91 million, up 60% year-over-year, as a result of favorable non-cat accident year experienced and favorable catastrophe losses, primarily in our homeowner's line. The combined ratio for property and casualty was 91.7% and 88.2% excluding catastrophes in the quarter. This was significantly below the combined ratio of 98.7% and 92.5% excluding cats in the first quarter of 2011 and well below plan. While we are pleased with these results, it should be pointed out that catastrophes are seasonal, and we plan for higher cats in the second and third quarters.  Latin America operating earnings were $148 million, up 22% year-over-year. On a constant rate basis, operating earnings were up 30% due to growth across the region and improved underwriting results. We expect Latin America's results to remain strong for the balance of the year.  In addition, the nonmedical health total benefit ratio for the quarter was 86.7%, 100 basis point improvement versus 87.7% in the first quarter of 2011. Results in dental were solid, reflecting favorable trend and utilization. And disability results were encouraging as the LTD incidence rate improved versus the prior year quarter and actually came in better than expected. However, I should point out recoveries continue to be weak.  Mortality results for the Americas were mixed in the quarter. Group life's loss ratio for the quarter was 89.1%, higher than the prior year quarter of 88.2% and a very strong fourth quarter of 85.2%. That said, the ratio was within our expectations. Retail life mortality ratio was 91.6% in the quarter, better than the prior year quarter of 92.5% but higher than a very favorable fourth quarter of 81.1%. Overall, retail life underwriting results were below plan but we would expect them to return to more normal levels.  Premiums, fees and other revenues for the Americas were $8.3 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter. This growth was primarily driven by higher separate account fees and income annuity premiums in retail annuities, higher closeouts and structured settlement sales in our Corporate Benefit Funding segment and growth in immediate annuity sales in Chile and universal life and AFORE sales in Mexico, which are all in our Latin America segment.  Let me turn to our Asia region. Operating earnings in the Asia region were $297 million, up 33% from $224 million in the prior year quarter, due to strong growth in the business, particularly in Japan, as well as improved expense efficiency. In Japan, operating earnings growth was driven by favorable results in accident and health and ordinary life, as well as improved expense efficiency.  Premiums, fees and other revenues in Asia were $2.3 billion, up 8% from $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2011. On a constant rate basis, revenue grew 3% due to business growth in Japan, Korea and Australia, as well as favorable persistency in both Japan and Korea. Japan premiums, fees and other revenues were up 10% year-over-year, 3% on a constant rate basis.  In addition, total sales for the region grew 15%, driven by increases in Japan, China and Australia. For the region, key product drivers were life and annuity sales in Japan, accident and health sales in Korea and China and group sales in Australia.  Turning to EMEA. In EMEA, first quarter results were solid and in line with expectations despite the challenging market conditions across the region. Operating earnings were $76 million, down 4% from the first quarter of 2011, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus key European currencies and the challenging economic environment. On a constant rate basis, operating earnings were up 2%, reflecting growth in emerging markets within the region. EMEA sales grew 7% compared to the first quarter of 2011 driven by our new distribution partner in Turkey and strong credit life sales.  Premiums, fees and other revenues increased 9% from the first quarter of 2011. On a constant rate basis, revenues were up 14%, driven by strong persistency and growth in emerging markets. Immediate annuities in Western Europe were also a driver. However, we are evaluating the product in light of the competitive environment there, which may dampen the run rate going forward.  Now let's turn to investments. Let me begin with variable investment income, which, as a reminder, now excludes securities lending. Pretax variable investment income was $239 million and within our 2012 quarterly guidance range of $150 million to $250 million. After taxes, variable investment income was $155 million. Barring any unforeseen market disruptions, we expect variable income to remain within our 2012 guidance range.  Next, let me briefly mention realized investment gains and losses. In the first quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net losses of $145 million. Included in this net loss are impairments of $103 million after tax. We expect investment portfolio net losses to remain relatively modest for the remainder of the year and within the full year range established on our Investor Day call.  Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform well. As of March 31, our valuation allowance is $368 million, down from $398 million at December 31. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 60% from 61%, as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, as of March 31, there were no delinquent loans in the portfolio and no losses recorded during the quarter on this $40 billion portfolio.  With respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax losses of $1.3 billion that were driven primarily by the impact of MetLife's credit spreads and higher interest rates. As a reminder, derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company.  Lastly, I would like to update you on certain European exposures. As of quarter end, the GAAP book value of our peripheral European sovereign debt was $210 million. In the second quarter of 2012 (sic), we did participate in the Greek debt exchange, and as a result of the exchange, our exposure to peripheral European sovereign debt has been further reduced to approximately $100 million, which is a very modest level given the size of our overall investment portfolio. With respect to European banks, we continue to selectively trim our positions during the quarter, and we believe our remaining exposure is very manageable given the size and diversification of our overall investment portfolio.  Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital position. First, our book value per share, excluding AOCI, is at $46.52 as of March 31, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 10%. That said, I should point out that our ending 2011 book value, excluding AOCI, was reduced by $2.5 billion or $2.34 per share as a result of the new DAC accounting rules. When adjusting for other equity impacts, the total reduction was $2.3 billion, which was within the range of our guidance of $2.1 billion to $2.6 billion provided on our December 5 call. In addition, after-tax derivative losses of $1.3 billion that I mentioned previously reduced book value by another $1.26 per share.  Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our statutory earnings and capital position. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the first quarter of 2012 were approximately $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The solid results were primarily driven by favorable underwriting and improved market conditions in the quarter.  As Steve mentioned, our combined RBC ratio for our U.S. life insurance companies, excluding Alico, at year end 2011 was 450%. Also, our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis was 880%. Our results clearly reflect a strong capital position in the U.S. and Japan.  Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at March 31 were approximately $4.4 billion, giving us deployable capital of roughly $3.4 billion above a $1 billion holding company cushion. In addition, we are projecting that deployable capital remains within the guidance range of $6 billion to $7 billion at year end 2012 prior to any capital management actions.  In conclusion, MetLife had a very good first quarter. Our margins remain strong, as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth, and our financial strength is intact, as reflected in our capital position which remains robust.  And with that, let me turn it back to the operator so we can take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will go to the line of Thomas Gallagher with Crédit Suisse.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just first, I had a sort of a philosophical question on capital and then a specific earnings question. The -- I guess the philosophical question is, how are you approaching the view of required capital right now? I mean, it's clearly in a bit of flux, both for you all and the industry, depending on different ways you might measure it versus history. So just curious how you would approach that. And in particular, how are you looking at that as part of your strategic review? And then just a question on the earnings side. I guess the U.S. earnings came in well above plan. How should we think about that as it relates to a run rate? It looks like to me it was a mix of strong investment spreads and good underwriting results. What's your anticipation as to whether or not that's going to be sustained for the balance of the year?
Steven A. Kandarian: Tom, as to capital, let me just start by saying that our philosophy about returning excess capital to shareholders remains intact. Having said that, we've lived most of our existence at MetLife under state regulatory regimes, which have one set of rules for us. We now, as you know, as a bank holding company are regulated additionally by the Fed, and there are different rules as a bank holding company, which we've talked about with respect to the Fed stress test we just went through. So that's why my remarks were cautious, in a sense of measuring all this, trying to take into account this changing regulatory landscape that we currently face. We are de-banking. There's still the issue of whether MetLife and other insurers, large insurers, may be designated by FSOC as a nonbank SIFI. So all those factors are taken into consideration as we think about when and how to return capital to shareholders. And as that landscape becomes clear to us and as we get through the bank -- de-banking process, then we'll have more to say about that. So those things are still a moving target. To date, no one's been designated yet in nonbank SIFIs. So we have to wait and see more on that. If you are designated as such, the rules are, at this point, not promulgated. So it is -- it's a difficult environment in which to operate from the point of view of providing clarity and certainty to our shareholders this very moment about our capital plans. As to U.S. earnings, I’ll simply say we had a very good Q1. Eric went through some of the details in that in terms of what drove those good earnings. As mentioned, we're not changing our guidance. Obviously, the strong first quarter puts upward pressure within the range that we provided to you at Investor Day. And beyond that, I'll simply say that we're heartened by the first quarter but it is uncertain environment out there in the world today and we're remaining with the current guidance. Eric, do you want to add anything to that?
Eric T. Steigerwalt: Sure, Steve. Let me just walk through very briefly here. As we said, we reported $1.37 per share normalizing to $1.39. Just thinking about a few things that we don't normalize as we consider them part of our business frankly. We did have about $0.04 of initial market impact that helped earnings in the Americas in the first quarter. We’ve talked about the fact that our variable investment income was at the higher end of our range. Our range is $150 million to $250 million, and we came in at $239 million. So you can think about that. In addition, on a normalized basis, we reported P&C earnings of $84 million. And as I mentioned, we expect higher cats in the second quarter and third quarter. And as a matter of fact, versus last year, we actually added another $20 million to our cat provision for the second quarter. So I think P&C earnings will come down a little bit in the second quarter. And finally, we had very good recurring income. We expect that to -- for the most degree, to continue going forward. But it was a very good quarter. So when I say recurring income, investment income, I mean non-variable. So you can think about maybe those 4 categories with respect to adjusting off of our normalized $1.39, Tom.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners.
Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC: Steve, you've made it pretty clear that exporting Alico's accident and health capabilities globally is a major strategic priority for MET. I was curious if that includes a desire also to place more of an emphasis on A&H in the U.S., where I think you're a pretty small player but there's -- the competitive environment still seems pretty favorable and the market penetration remains pretty low there.
Steven A. Kandarian: Yes, I think you pegged it. That is our intention. We -- the accident and health business that was really, I guess, started in Japan some 20 or 30 years ago has -- Alico did a very good job of rolling that out around the world, and that continues today. Our accident and health sales are up, for instance, in Latin America are up very nicely, and that -- it's through a number of different channels. So our presence in accident and health in the U.S. is very modest, and we expect that we will be developing products and rolling that out through a number of channels, really, starting this year but obviously continuing over the next couple of years to build some momentum.
Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC: Okay, great. And then M&A opportunities in the U.S. and abroad seem to have heated up a little bit lately. How are you thinking about M&A at this point, I guess in terms of both geography and product mix? And along the same lines, when you look at potential M&A accretion versus share repurchase, are you now factoring in the factor that you're likely to be able to deploy a greater amount of capital into M&A at this point versus buyback?
Steven A. Kandarian: Our view of M&A really hasn't changed. We've talked about a number of times in the past. As we look at deals, we'll compare it to a share buyback program as well. And we have to see accretion soon after a deal closes. It doesn't have to be day one. It depends upon the deal and the importance of the transaction to us. But you can be assured that we remain disciplined in any sort of M&A transactions that we do. I have no comment today about any specific M&A deals. Obviously, we don't talk about that until there's certainty. But we are still looking at properties, not just in the United States but globally, that may make sense in terms of being a good fit from our point of view strategically. So that's kind of the key message.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research: My first question is just a, I guess, clarification. When you gave the book value guidance for year end 2012 in the neighborhood of $50, that was accounting for the DAC accounting change?
Eric T. Steigerwalt: Yes, it was.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research: Okay. And secondly, just a broad question about SIFI. Is it your understanding that companies designated as SIFIs will have to submit a capital plan for calendar year 2013? I mean, in other words, will the framework, the regulatory framework be in place by the end of this year?
Eric T. Steigerwalt: Sean, we just don't know. At this point, there is not much clarity provided by Washington on this topic. So we don't have an answer for you.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: A couple of quick ones. Did you -- I'm just curious whether you filed a challenge to the Fed's decision on your capital plan. I think you had, like others, 30 days to do so. It seems clear to me, at least, that some of the adjustments that they made to your plan didn't make much sense. So I'm wondering whether you filed any petition along those lines?
Steven A. Kandarian: John, we did not file an appeal. We obviously looked at that avenue as a possibility. Given the fact that we are de-banking and we looked at the time lines of these, we thought it made more sense to focus our energies on de-banking.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then along those lines, you mentioned that the closing of the bank sale and the deregistration of the holding company is clearly subject to various regulatory approvals. I guess my question is just -- based on the progress to date, do you still expect the closing of the bank by the end of the second quarter, or is that something that could slip further?
Steven A. Kandarian: As you know, these transactions are subject to regulatory approval, specifically FDIC and even the Fed has an involvement in it in terms of us de-banking, and we just can't say with certainty when the regulatory approvals will be forthcoming. The FDIC has to put it on their docket. They meet once a month. I'm sure they've a lot of matters before them. So at this point in time, we don't have clarity on our side to be specific about timing.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just one more quick one. Aside from the specific capital plan, buybacks and the dividend raise, is there any restriction on you to, for instance, deploy capital into paying down debt maturities and/or spending capital on acquisition opportunities?
Steven A. Kandarian: Not as to paying down debt certainly. And we do talk to the Fed, typically, before doing an M&A transaction, especially the larger ones. So we keep them informed.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I guess just following up on John's. So the $800 million debt maturity, you plan on refinancing?
Eric T. Steigerwalt: Right now, it's uncertain. We've mentioned that we may do that, but we'll let you know as we get through the year.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. Maybe just to drill into annuities a little bit. Obviously, the sales numbers did come down as targeted. And I think in the opening remarks, you alluded to product changes. My question is, do you have any further planned changes in annuities going forward, and are there any other changes that you're making at the distribution level that's helping to control the sales level towards the targeted $18 billion range for the year?
William J. Wheeler: Yes. Mark, it's Bill Wheeler. We haven't announced any new product changes or any more product changes to annuities. But there -- but I'd be very surprised if we didn't have some changes going forward. And yes, we're always sort of tweaking our distribution in terms of which distributors. Obviously, we have our own agents, but obviously third parties, and we're always looking at sort of the productivity of the various third-party channels we have. So I'd be very surprised if there weren't further changes.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just maybe one follow-up to, I think, Tom's question earlier specific to annuities. When I look at annuity earnings and I adjust down for the market factors that you talked about, Eric, the $0.04, it still was a very strong annuity earnings core. I think your ROAs went up quite a bit sequentially, 3 basis points or so. Is this level sustainable, or were there any other kind of favorability items in there that we shouldn't really think about as a run rate adjusting for the market?
Eric T. Steigerwalt: Look, you got the market piece, obviously. We had great spreads. We had record spreads in the retail annuity business, 309 basis points. So within there, as per my sort of global comments on spreads, recurring investment income was very good. Now part of that is propped up by the interest rate floors, not only in this business but in others. So I would have to say, I'm not expecting record spreads every quarter, but it was clearly a good quarter and much of it is sustainable.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A question in terms of -- it seems like uncertainty remains kind of the prominent word here when it comes to regulation and capital deployment. So -- and we've seen regulatory matters clearly get pushed back or delayed in the past. So I guess what can be done sort of in the near to intermediate term to potentially reduce the capital that continues to build as we await clarity?
Steven A. Kandarian: Chris, there's not a lot that can be done. We're waiting for clarity, and -- but we -- if there is an M&A transaction that makes sense to us, we're going to pursue those kinds of activities. But again, I have nothing today to report to you on that front. Over time, when we are able to de-bank, we'll make a decision about returning or deploying capital in October. We'll talk about our dividend. But at this point in time, given the regulatory environment, that's as much as I can say.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the pension closeout market? I mean, obviously, PRU has had some success recently. But it seems like a lot of CFOs are eager to get this risk off their balance sheet, yet we haven't really seen the big transactions take place. So I guess what do you think it'll take to begin to push some of these things across the finish line?
William J. Wheeler: Chris, it's Bill. I think there is an interest on corporate America's part to getting rid of, I would say, traditional pension plans and doing a closeout. What's giving them pause is continued low interest rates. I mean, the -- when interest rates are this low, the cost of doing that, even if they have a well-funded plan, isn't that attractive. I think they're -- they've kind of said, "Gee, we should just wait. We don't have to do this now. We should wait. Interest rates will be higher." But I think the reality is coming home that interest rates may stay this low for a while yet, given what the Fed says every day. So I think what might occur is -- if there's one big trade printed, they might -- that I think that people might say, "Well, it's probably time to go." So I think this market is pretty dynamic right now in terms of what might break and when. So we'll just -- we'll have to wait and see.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Randy Binner with FBR.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: I just had a kind of a follow-up on Corporate Benefit Funding. The segment has held up well despite the low rate environment. Has it been the -- was it the U.K. again in the first quarter of '12 carrying the result? I think that activity there has been moving along better than in the U.S.
William J. Wheeler: Yes, sales activity has been good. There's not a very big block in the U.K. So the profit contribution from that business is modest. I mean it's profitable, but it's modest. So -- but sales activity has been good. I mean, there's a lot of closeout activity in the U.K. right now.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: And I guess to follow up, too. I guess your answer to Chris's question before, Bill, was that you could still see big U.S. closeouts go. But I guess is -- are smaller scale solutions going to be more of a focus? I mean, is there real traction there, or do we really have to kind of wait for those lumpy big deals to come through?
William J. Wheeler: Well, look, that's -- if you look at our -- the deals that we're executing on now, you would say they're sort of small deals, and that's been that way for a while. I think -- or relatively small deals. They're -- I think what people have talked about for a number of years, including us, is there are a number of large pension plans out there, is something else going to happen and something that would really be big. And the answer is we don't know yet. We'll have to wait and see. Clearly, there's an interest on the part of corporate America to do those deals. But obviously, we've -- I talked about the pressure is what's causing them to pause.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I had a couple of questions. The first one, for Steve, just on your approach to share buybacks. Obviously, there's uncertainty on how long it could take you to deregister the bank holding company. But assuming that you're able to do it by sometime in late 2012, would you still wait for more clarity on the SIFI rules before you resume share buybacks, or would you start repurchases regardless? And then the second question, maybe Bill can answer that, is just on individual life. Your mortality has been weak, I think, in -- or margins have been weak for 3 of the last 5 quarters. Part of that, I think, is lower reinsurance offsets. But just to your comfort with pricing in your individual life book, especially since you've been raising prices as well. Is there any one product that's causing weakness or part of the block? Just what your comfort level is with the underwriting in that block?
Steven A. Kandarian: Jimmy, on the first one, buybacks, let me start by saying it is our intent to return excess capital to our shareholders. That remains a strong commitment on our part. And I also said that we can look at the entire landscape at a time when we can return capital to shareholders. Right now, we cannot. So we'll take a look at all the factors, how MetLife is doing, our capital position, the overall economic environment, what's going on there and the regulatory landscape as the key factors, and we'll have to assess that as that day comes in terms of being able to return capital. So right now, I just -- I don't see any upside in me making predictions about what all those factors will look like at the point in time when we can return capital to our shareholders. So I'm afraid it's not the clarity you'd like to have, and frankly, it's not the clarity I’d like to give you, but that's the environment we're living in.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: No, I know what it is. The reason I'm asking is in previous cases, you guys have made recommendations that obviously have -- and things have been out of your control but you've implied a higher level of certainty with this than was really the case.
Steven A. Kandarian: I think you're right, we have. And we anticipated passing the Fed stress test, and we did not.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then on the individual life question?
Eric T. Steigerwalt: Sure, Jimmy. So now earnings were down a little bit in individual life, but really that was due entirely to -- or almost entirely to the settlement we reached, because the reserve adjustments that had to be made to ascete [ph] those old policies were in the charge there, which is the $26 million after tax was in that line. I think if you added that back, I think individual life had a pretty good quarter. You are right. I mean, mortality is up a bit this quarter. There is a seasonality aspect to mortality. And oftentimes, the mortality report -- remember, that's gross before reinsurance offsets. And reinsurance offsets, that's just -- it can move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. If you look over any lengthy period of time, we are -- our mortality experience is actually pretty good. The pressure on pricing changes, and that's really occurring in UL, is all about interest rates and the capital that's needed to support the ULSG guarantees. And so we, and really, I think everybody in the industry is as well, we're all raising prices in UL. It's -- in this kind of an interest rate environment, it's just not as an attractive product. And because of that, you can see our sales are down this quarter, as we continue to tighten pricing there. So I -- that's, I would say, what's really going on with individual life pricing.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Ed Spehar with Bank of America.
Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I have 2 questions. First, can you give us any sense on the visibility of VII in the second quarter?
Steven J. Goulart: Yes, it's Steve Goulart. I think Eric actually, probably, gave the answer already. But as we look at VII for the next quarter and the rest of the year, we still expect it to perform within the plan that we set out at the beginning of the year.
Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: But I guess -- anything related to high end or low end? I think there's about a $0.06 gap between the 2.
Steven J. Goulart: I think we're still comfortable with the range we've given and that we expect to be in that range.
Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: All right. And the second question is Milliman's Hedge Cost Index for VA was at an average level in the first quarter that was similar to the peak we saw during the financial crisis. So I guess the question is, do you think that this index accurately captures the cost of hedging for the business? And if it does, would you anticipate that more companies are going to follow your lead and pull back from this business? And I mean, will you continue to follow? I guess if others raise prices, lower guarantees, will you continue to follow those down?
William J. Wheeler: Well, I'll be honest. I don't follow the Milliman Hedge Cost Index. I don't want to give them an endorsement, frankly. We look at our own hedge cost index. Our hedge cost index actually went down. It's not anywhere near what it was at the peak, and it was actually down from the last couple of quarters. So my guess is, we don't track very well with that index. That's one. Two is, in terms of pulling back -- I mean, remember now, we're only going back to sales that we had in 2010, right. I mean, 2011 was a bit of an aberration because of the way we priced the new product. So it's all relevant in terms of what you mean pulling back. Obviously, we've seen people in the industry exit this business, and a lot of that has to do with, frankly, their historical risk management performance. And they just couldn't stand the pain anymore. Our experience is very different and we've talked about on many different occasions about how we hedge this product and how we've come through the financial crisis. So we're -- we think we're in much better shape, and we think the product we sell today has a very good return. So hedging costs are still a little elevated relative to our pricing assumptions, but just a little bit, frankly, and that does jump around. So I guess that's kind of our feeling about that.
Eric T. Steigerwalt: Bill, I'll just add. Ed, with the new product, as we go through this year, our hedging costs will continue to come down a little bit. So you can factor that in as you think about this as well.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Joanne Smith with Scotia Capital.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division: Yes. I just wanted to follow up on the M&A and just talk a little bit more from a philosophical level. It just seems that there's been a number of properties that have been talked about or have actually been put on the market. And I just -- I'm just wondering, Steve, if you think that this is a period that we're entering into of greater consolidation for a longer-term period. And I don't expect you to comment on specific transactions, but just in terms of, philosophically speaking, it looks like there's a lot more capital rationalization going on, especially with respect to some more distressed properties.
Steven A. Kandarian: Joanne, I think that's right. There are things that, frankly, we've known about now for a year or 2 in terms of certain companies that have made announcements that they'll be divesting of certain properties as they try to repair their own balance sheets. And those properties now are entering the marketplace. Some have already been on the marketplace for a while and have been sold. So I think that trend will continue for some period of time. And as you can imagine, most any transaction of any size, we do look at. These transactions are shown to us. We are looking at properties that make sense, from a strategic point of view, in terms of our goals going forward, in terms of we want to expand our business. So we look at those properties very closely. We determine whether or not to make a bid. But if we make a bid, again, as we've said many times, has to make sense from a point of view of shareholder value creation, which means it has to be accretive soon or immediately, and we compare it to share repurchases.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division: Is it a buyer's or seller's market, Steve? And I guess there's probably different answers for each kind of transaction, but generally speaking.
Steven A. Kandarian: I'd say that right after the start of the crisis, it was very much a buyer's market. And Alico is an example of that. I think now it's more of a neutral market. It's not like 2006, 2007, where it's clearly a seller’s market. But I'd say within that, there are segments. So certain properties, you can imagine -- you've read the announcements of a number of companies looking to expand in markets in Asia. So properties of that nature are getting more attention and, potentially, more aggressive bidding. Other markets and other properties that perhaps are not growing as rapidly might shift a little bit more toward the buyer side.
Operator: And our final question will come from the line of John Hall with Wells Fargo Securities.
John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: My question has to do more with, I guess, growth. And over in Japan, it looked like there was a lot of that going on. And I was hoping you could offer a little bit more granularity about what you're selling, why sales are up so much and perhaps touch on some of the other regions as well.
William Hogan: This is Bill Hogan. Let me start to reiterate what Steve said that sales were up 28%. We saw double-digit growth across all of our channels, also saw a good mix of different products in terms of life products, annuity products and our A&H products were all up in the course of the first quarter. The leading distribution was bancassurance, and our independent agents, particularly the broker general agents, had a real strong quarter. They continue to have strong growth opportunities there. A reminder that this obviously does not include the month of March, which is traditionally the strongest month for the bank business because we report the quarter with a one month lag. So we see some great growth there, and we've got a good balance risk profile due to the diversity of our product mix. So we continue to see that broad product mix and the good diversity of products, and that is what we see going forward as well.
John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess the question is why.
William Hogan: I think on the independent side and the bank side, we had some very strong wholesaling and training. They're still learning the business. The BGA business is growing rapidly, and they need training. And our wholesalers are providing that. The banks are still getting new into the life insurance market, and we're providing the training to help support that. On the independent or career side of our agency channel, we continue to see steady growth there through providing good solid products, and we're offering consultative-type sales that include both a life product as well as an A&H product. And that's really what customers are looking for these days. On the direct marketing side, we've been repositioning the portfolio and doing a lot more outbound telemarketing, and that's been extremely successful, as well as starting to see some sales on the Internet.
John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Great. And can we get an early look on March?
William Hogan: Well, March is, as I said, it’s the end of the year for the bank business, so it looks -- that certainly will look pretty strong, and I think we'll see a good second quarter relative to prior year. A reminder that last year, we had the earthquake which dampened sales substantially. So good second quarter. It looks promising, and the bar certainly gets raised in the third and fourth quarter.
John McCallion: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us. Obviously, if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to contact the Investor Relations department. And everyone, have a great day. Thanks.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to John McCallion, Head of Investor Relations.
John McCallion: Great. Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife Fourth Quarter 2011 Earning Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings press release, our Quarterly Financial Supplements and in the Other Financial Information section. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investments and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. I would also like to bring your attention to one item. As noted in our press release, during the fourth quarter of 2011, MetLife began reporting certain operations of MetLife Bank and Insurance operations in the Caribbean Region, Panama and Costa Rica as divested businesses. As a result, we have modified our definition of operating earnings to exclude the impact of these divested businesses, and prior periods have been reclassified to confirm -- conform to the current period segment presentation. Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Steigerwalt, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Toppeta, Vice Chairman of EMEA and Asia.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin this morning with by an overview of MetLife's performance for the full year 2011. Overall, MetLife had a solid year. We generated operating earnings per share of $5.02, up 16% from 2010, and our operating return on shareholders' equity was 11%, up 100 basis points from 10% in 2010. These results are even more noteworthy in light of a challenging external environment the insurance industry faced in 2011. The global macroeconomic environment remain volatile. Interest rates declined, equity markets were flat and several natural disasters in both the United States and Japan drove up claims. Adjusting for certain onetime items, which we discussed at our December investor call, MetLife's 2011 operatings -- operating earnings would have been $5.25 per share. Capping a solid 2011 was a strong fourth quarter. MetLife delivered operating earnings per share of $1.31, up 11% year-over-year. In our U.S. Businesses, underwriting discipline continue to produce favorable results in Group Life, with a loss ratio of 85.2%, as well as in Dental. In addition, core spreads held relatively stable despite the low interest rate environment, largely as a result of our disciplined asset liability management, our hedging strategies and our private asset origination capabilities. Outside the United States, we continue to be pleased with our financial results and our progress in integrating Alico. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, sales increased by 12% on a combined basis while premiums, fees and other revenue rose by 1%. We generated $570 million in operating earnings on $3.8 billion of premiums, fees and other revenues. Top line growth was negatively impacted by the disposition of noncore businesses, nonrenewals of certain large group accounts and the accounting impact of a shift towards savings products. In Japan, sales increased in the Bank and Independent channels. In other international regions, we benefited from our acquisition in Turkey and in leveraging of our accident health capabilities in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Total sales of A&H, a low capital, high-ROE product, increased roughly 25% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the growth of our non-U.S. businesses. As we said on our December investor call, we expect to grow operating earnings by roughly 14% outside of the United States in 2012, after adjusting for the new accounting treatment of deferred acquisition costs. One final note from the quarter concerns variable annuity sales. As we discussed on our last call, we sold $8.6 billion of VAs in the third quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter, VA sales declined 16% to $7.2 billion in line with our expectations. As I have said previously, one of our guiding principles at MetLife is to strike the right balance between growth, profitability and risk. Consistent with that principle, we are committed to actively managing the level of our VA sales. In January, we once again reduced the roll-up rate on our GMIB Max product, from 5.5% to 5%. This change is having the desired effect. VA sales in the early part of the year are tracking with our 2012 guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion, consistent with the level of VA sales prior to 2011. With the management actions we are taking, we are confident that VA sales will remain an important part of our overall product mix. Despite the low interest rate environment in which we are operating, MetLife's businesses continue to generate excess capital. We finished 2011 where we expected, with $3.5 billion of deployable capital. By the end of 2012, we anticipate deployable capital to grow to $6 billion to $7 billion before any deployments. As I previously mentioned, it is our intention to begin returning excess capital to shareholders this year pending regulatory approval.  In January, we submitted our 2012 capital plan to the Federal Reserve and expect to receive a response before the end of the first quarter. Qualitatively, we believe we have developed a robust, forward-looking capital planning process, consistent with the Fed's guidelines. Quantitatively, we specifically designed our capital plan to meet the Fed's requirement that we have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. Finally, we believe that approval of our capital plan is consistent with the Fed's mandate to promote maximum employment as MetLife shareholders would redeploy idle capital in a more productive manner. At the same time, we continue to move forward with our plans to seize being a bank holding company. On December 27, 2011, we announced the sale of our depository business GE Capital, which we expect to close during the second quarter. In addition, we are writing -- we are winding down our forward mortgage business and exiting our Warehouse Finance business through an asset sale to EverBank. Further down the road, a number of insurance companies face the possibility of being named nonbank systemically important financial institutions. To be clear, we do not believe the life insurance business poses a systemic risk to the U.S. economy, and we look forward to continuing to meet with policymakers to convey our position.  The business of life insurance is highly regulated with strict capital reserve and derivative use requirements. With regard to derivatives, we are -- which are one of the key aspects of our business that regulators will examine, we are well collateralized and our counterparty exposure is well diversified, providing protection to policy holders and shareholders alike. Just as our decision to reduce VA sales as part of our commitment to managing our portfolio of products, MetLife also continues to manage its portfolio of markets. In November, we announced that we were divesting our businesses in the Caribbean, Panama and Costa Rica. And last month, we announced our plans to acquire from Aviva plc its Life Insurance businesses in Eastern Europe, which will expand MetLife's presence in growth markets. As I said on our December investor call, we are going to invest in those markets that we consider core and divest from those that do not meet our strategic priorities or financial requirements. Now let me turn to strategy and our recent organizational changes. As CEO of MetLife, I believe it is important for us to continuously reassess our strategy, especially in light of the uncertain external environment. We'll provide the details of our current strategic review at our next investor event on May 23. You've already heard me say that capital is precious and that we must limit its use to those activities that can best create long-term shareholder value. Of course, having the right strategy is not sufficient. On our earnings call last July, I outlined some of my key priorities to ensure that MetLife is equipped to deliver strong business results. I spoke of the importance of maximizing the value of our brand, which we have done with the naming rights to MetLife Stadium, our extensive rebranding efforts in key Alico markets, such as Japan, and our new U.S. advertising campaign launched during the Super Bowl. I discussed sharpening our focus on value creation and have emphasized to our senior leaders that we must pursue profitable growth, with returns that exceed our cost to capital, and I described MetLife's commitment to recruiting top talent, which is our guiding principle in selecting a new CFO and President of Asia. Last November, I also announced that MetLife was reorganizing from a U.S. and international structure, into 3 broad geographic regions: the Americas, EMEA and Asia and creating a global employee benefits business. We are continuing to implement that reorganization plan and have taken a number of additional steps to enhance our operating model. Today, I like to give you a high-level overview of our Americas division. Under the leadership of Bill Wheeler, the Americas is comprised of the following 6 core businesses: Retail, Corporate Benefit Funding, Group, Voluntary and Worksite, Latin America and Direct. Once we have named a new CFO, Eric Steigerwalt will lead the Retail business, which includes Individual Life and VAs.  What will not change as a result of our new structure is MetLife's commitment to ensuring that customers can do business with us through a variety of channels. For example, even as we were to develop our direct-to-consumer business, we recognize the face-to-face distribution through agents and advisors is critical to our success. Having a diversity of channels is a competitive advantage that enables us to pursue growth in multiple markets simultaneously. The final topic I want to address this morning is the impact of interest rates on MetLife's financial performance. We discussed this topic at length last fall, and since that time the shares of MetLife have traded with less correlation to the 10-year treasury. Even so, when the Fed announced its decision to keep short-term interest rates low through 2014, the shares of life insurers fell sharply that day. One question we have been asked is whether MetLife's 2012 earnings would be impacted by low interest rates over the entire year, especially since our guidance assumed that 10-year treasury would rise from about 2% last fall to 3% by the end of 2012. The short answer is no. We reran our 2012 projections assuming the 10-year treasury holds constant during the year. The decline in investment income will be offset by income generated by our interest rate floors.  Over the longer term, low interest rates would have impacted MetLife's earnings, as we explained in detail last fall. Under the scenario we used at that time, we held a 10-year treasury flat at 2% over 5 years. MetLife's operating earnings still grew over the 5-year period but at a slower rate. It's important to note that we assume no extraordinary management actions under that scenario. In reality, we have a number of tools that can and would be used to mitigate the impact of sustained low rates, including pricing, crediting rates and expense management. To sum up, MetLife had a solid 2011 and a strong fourth quarter, even in the face of some significant market pressures. Our capital position is strong and getting stronger, and our ability to grow operating earnings in the face of low interest rates remains intact. In short, we think we're the best-positioned company in the life insurance sector to deliver shareholder value. Thank you again for joining us this morning. And with that, I will turn the call over to Eric Steigerwalt.
Eric T. Steigerwalt: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.31 per share for the fourth quarter. When adjusting for a few nonrecurring items, which I will discuss shortly, normalized operating earnings were $1.30 per share. You will note this result is comfortably higher than our fourth quarter guidance range of $1.16 to $1.26 provided to you during our Investor call on December 5. The primary drivers for this outperformance were higher-than-expected variable investment income, lower expenses and stock market performance in December coming in better than expected. Overall, I would characterize this as a very good quarter driven by solid underwriting margins, strong and stable core investment spreads, which reflect how well we have managed the business despite the low-rate environment, and continuing expense control. Underwriting margins were healthy due to our ongoing pricing discipline. This was most evident this quarter on our group insurance operations, with a very favorable mortality ratio in Group Life and in improving benefit ratio in our non-medical health businesses. In Japan, accident and health underwriting margins continue to be quite attractive.  And finally, expenses remain very much under control. Our overall expense ratio was 22.3% in the quarter, after recasting for the divested businesses in the bank and the Caribbean, as John indicated earlier. Now let me walk you through our financial results and point out some of the highlights. First, let me discuss some normalizing items, which occurred during the fourth quarter. As part of our annual review of DAC assumptions, we had net positive DAC unlocking and other net adjustments of $27 million after tax in our U.S. Businesses.  In our Insurance Products segment, Individual Life had a net positive unlocking and other reserve adjustments of $65 million after tax. The favorable unlocking was driven by a policyholder dividend scale reduction on a portion of our Individual Life business and updates to our SOP reserving model in our Universal Life business. In Retirement Products, we had negative DAC unlockings and reserve adjustments of $38 million after tax, primarily as a result of a reduction in the long-term assumption for our separate account returns. This change was due to the higher allocation to bonds that we are seeing in our separate accounts, which is causing the blended return to be slightly lower. Next, our Auto & Home business had favorable prior year development reserve release in its Auto business of $14 million after tax. This was partially offset by incurred catastrophe losses of $18 million after tax in the quarter, which was $6 million above our fourth quarter planned provision of $12 million after tax. The net impact of these 2 items benefited Auto & Home's operating earnings by $8 million after tax. And finally, Alico integration expenses in the quarter were $20 million after tax. We have recorded these expenses in our Corporate & Other segment. Now let's take a look at the results in the quarter by line of business. In U.S. business, we reported operating earnings of $932 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of onetime items that I mentioned, normalized operating earnings were $897 million. This reflects solid operating earnings growth of 4% on a reported basis as compared to the prior year period of $894 million and 9% higher on a normalized basis. The primary drivers of this normalized earnings growth were strong underwriting results in Group Life and Dental, as well as strong separate account fee growth in our Retirement Products segment. Premiums, fees and other revenue were $7.6 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher U.K. pension closeouts in our Corporate Benefit Funding segment and higher premiums and fees in Retirement Products. While Insurance Products’ top line was essentially flat this quarter, we do expect to see a pickup in 2012 revenue growth consistent with our plan, as we are experiencing a nice rebound in 2012 Group Life sales and persistency and continued growth on our Dental business, primarily driven by the addition of the TRICARE Dental account. Auto & Home had solid growth in the quarter as net written premiums were up 2% year-over-year. Insurance Products normalized earnings of $346 million were up 7% over the prior year quarter. This strong performance is mainly driven by improved Group Life and Nonmedical Health underwriting margins.  The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was a very favorable 85.2%, below both the prior year quarter of 89.7% and our 2011 guidance range of 88% to 93%. Overall, we are pleased with Group Life's steady underwriting results, reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline. The Nonmedical Health total benefits ratio for the quarter was 88.9%, which was down from the prior year quarter of 89.7% and within our 2011 guidance of 86% to 90%. Underwriting trends in Dental remain favorable due to more stable utilization and pricing trends. However, disability results were less favorable than recent quarters. Although claims incidents improved in the quarter, we did see higher average claims’ size and weaker recovery experience. Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 81.1% compared to 82.9% in the prior year quarter. While direct mortality was good, we did have weaker reinsurance recoverables on some high-face amount claims. Turning to our Auto & Home business. Normalized operating earnings for the quarter were $73 million, up 4% versus the year-ago quarter. The combined ratio including catastrophes was 93.8% for the fourth quarter, favorable to the prior year quarter's result of 95.2%. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 90.2% in the fourth quarter, generally in line with the prior year quarter of 90%. Overall, this was a good bounce-back quarter for Auto & Home to close out a year that was materially impacted by record catastrophes and adverse weather. Retirement Products normalized operating earnings of $254 million were up 16% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings growth was primarily driven by higher fees from growth in the separate accounts balances of 12% year-over-year. Corporate Benefit Funding operating earnings of $224 million were up 8% over the prior year quarter on a normalized basis, largely reflecting increased net investment income from growth in the general account, which was up 4% year-over-year. Now let's discuss our businesses in Japan and Other International Regions. Focusing on Japan first. Our Japan operation produced good results for the quarter. Japan's operating earnings for the fourth quarter were a strong $326 million, up 3% over third quarter 2011, driven by solid Accident and Health underwriting results, improvements in persistency, as well as higher net investment income.  Japan sales grew 16% in the quarter as compared with the combined MetLife and Alico results for the fourth quarter of 2010. We continue to experience strong sales growth in the agency and bank channels. Our expectation is that sales growth will continue to be solid in 2012, but perhaps at more modest growth rates due to prior year recovery from the financial crisis, causing tougher comparisons from our 2011 sales. The year-over-year increase in fourth quarter revenues on a combined basis was approximately 5%, driven largely by the favorable exchange rate of the yen versus the U.S. dollar. On a constant rate basis, revenues were down 2%, on a combined basis, as GAAP revenue growth has been dampened by the shift towards FAS 97 savings products. While the revenue for these products is accounted for differently than the risk protection products sold in Japan, resulting in incrementally lower PFOs and higher net investment income, their margins and earnings are comparable. In our Other International Regions segment, operating earnings were $244 million, down 6% from the third quarter 2011, due to foreign exchange rates and the challenging European market conditions. However, our Latin America and Middle East businesses continue to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth. OIR sales grew 9% in the quarter as compared with the combined MetLife and Alico results in the fourth quarter of 2010, driven by strong sales in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Sales growth was negatively impacted by the challenging market conditions in Western Europe and Asia Pacific regions. The year-over-year revenues decreased on a combined basis by approximately 2%, reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar. On a constant rate basis, revenues were up 2%. Revenue growth within OIR was relatively soft due to our strategic pruning of noncore businesses, non-renewal of some large institutional cases that did not meet our profitability targets and the annual resumption -- annual assumption review in our Korea business, which actually has a revenue effect. Offsetting for these factors, OIR revenue growth would've been approximately 8% on a combined basis. Despite the tragic events in Japan, ongoing unrest in the Middle East and adverse market conditions in Europe, our businesses outside of the United States, taken as a whole, were within their full-year plan range for sales, premiums, fees and other revenue. We have made significant progress in leveraging our accident and health product portfolio by expanding our capabilities into Asia Pacific and Latin America. As Steve mentioned, total Accident and Health sales increased by approximately 25%, a strong result. These products have low capital requirements, attractive returns and high customer demand in emerging economies, which fits nicely into the guiding principles that Steve has already outlined. Now let me turn to investments. I'll begin with variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income was $247 million and within our 2011 quarterly guidance range of $225 million to $325 million. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $162 million. While results were in the planned range, variable investment income is lower sequentially and compared to the prior year driven by lower private equity income, reflective of the third quarter market decline, and volatility that we've said can occur within these asset classes. Next, let me briefly mention realized investment gains and losses. In the fourth quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net losses, excluding divested businesses, of $213 million. Included in this net loss are impairments of $163 million after-tax, of which $123 million relate to our Greek sovereign debt holdings. Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform extremely well. As of December 31, our valuation allowance is $398 million, down from $428 million at the end of September. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again in this quarter to 61% from 62%, as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, our delinquency rate remains very low, and more importantly, our losses recorded during 2011 were only $12 million on a $40 billion portfolio. With respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax gains excluding divested businesses of $351 million that were driven primarily by lower interest rates and gains in our variable annuity hedging programs. Lastly, I’d like to update you on certain European exposures. During the fourth quarter, we continued to manage down our exposure to peripheral European sovereign debt. As a result of targeted sales and the recognition of impairments, we have reduced our GAAP book value to $254 million, a relatively modest level given the size of our overall investment portfolio. We continue to reduce our exposure to European banks as well. We sold approximately $250 million of GAAP book value in the fourth quarter for a loss of $18 million, bringing the full-year 2011 sales total to $3.2 billion. The sales were focused on those institutions with exposure to peripheral Europe, securities with a lower preference in the capital structure and larger absolute exposures. Looking forward, we believe our remaining European exposure is quite manageable given the size and diversification of our overall investment portfolio. Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital position. First, our book value per share excluding AOCI is $49.02 as of year-end, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 13%. Steve referenced earlier how well protected the income statement is in a sustained low interest rate environment. I would add that our balance sheet remains quite strong and is well positioned to remain so, even if -- even in a sustained low rate environment. As we have previously stated, even if rates stay low for the next 5 years, our balance sheet, both on a GAAP and stat basis, would only be modestly impacted. This is the result of managing for the long term, utilizing prudent risk management techniques and taking actions prior to the crisis, not waiting until it was upon us. Let me also provide you with an update on our statutory earnings and capital position. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the fourth quarter of 2011 were approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. As you may recall, our third quarter statutory operating earnings were impacted by an increase in reserves. Primarily related to the weakness in the equity markets. Included in our fourth quarter results is the reversal of a portion of that position due to the strong equity market performance in the fourth quarter.  For full year 2011, our preliminary statutory operating earnings and net income were each approximately $2.6 billion. These results were negatively impacted by catastrophes, similar to GAAP and market-related reserve items in 2011. Our total adjusted capital is at $27.7 billion as of December 31, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8%.  While we have not completely finished our RBC calculations for 2011, based on our work to date, we are estimating that our consolidated RBC ratio will end the year at the upper end of our guidance range of 420% to 445% that we gave you during our December 5 call. Also, we are estimating that our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis will be within our guidance range of 850% to 950%. Consistent with our guidance, cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at December 31 were approximately $4.5 billion, giving us deployable capital of $3.5 billion, $1 billion above our holding company cushion. In addition, we are projecting that deployable capital will be within the guidance range we gave of $6 billion to $7 billion at year-end 2012 prior to any capital management actions. In conclusion, MetLife had a very good fourth quarter, completing a strong 2011 despite the ongoing challenging environment. Our margins remain strong as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth. Our financial strength is intact. Our balance sheet is positioned to withstand a sustained low rate environment, and our capital position remains robust. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator so we may take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Sanford Bernstein.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: My first question is on the variable annuity business. Obviously, you guys have added a lot of business second half of the year, but even as we go back to the earlier part of 2011. At -- this business had guarantees that were richer than what you're currently comfortable with. So if I think back to the last quarter, I think you talked about ROAs of kind of 14% to 15% -- ROIs, excuse me, of 14% to 15%. And I'm just wondering, kind of given the environment that we're in, how are you feeling about those returns on a go-forward basis.
William J. Wheeler: Suneet, it's Bill Wheeler. The -- I think the ROIs that we talked about on the previous call, I think those are still consistent even in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we had, I would say, a little bit lower than 15% ROI on our VA sales. The cost of hedging is still relatively high, and so that obviously depressed the number a little bit. We don't consider those returns adequate. And so obviously that's why we changed the roll-up rate at the beginning of January back down to 5%, and we've also changed a number of other features. I guess I would say by the way, just keep in mind when we talk about ROIs, we're talking about fully allocated expenses here, not marginal expenses, and that's always important. That's how we look at it, and we think that's the right way to look at it. And so we feel the sales, clearly, we had in the fourth quarter and in the latter part of the year were above our cost of capital. We created value through those sales, but we think we need to improve. And so therefore, that's why we've changed our pricing.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I guess I'm a little surprised to hear you say that they're not adequate. So where should we -- or where do you think the ROIs on the 5% product would put you?
William J. Wheeler: Well, obviously, it depends on market conditions, but we want to be 15%-plus in terms of ROIs. The risk profile of that product is such that we think we need to earn 15%-plus.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And then my last question, also on VAs, is at your -- during your interest rate call, you talked about perhaps using the strategy of going back to your legacy book and using some of the asset allocation techniques in the GMIB Max and sort of rolling those out. And I guess I'm wondering, if you're successful in doing that, could that have a significant impact on the ROIs of that back book?
William J. Wheeler: We're still pursuing that strategy, but it's one of, I would say, a group of strategies we're doing to improve the performance of the in-force book. And so as a whole, I think they will have -- as a group, I think they'll have an impact that is measurable. But that one technique is -- it'll depend on the adoption and the investment in that -- in those new funds, which, by the way, have performed very well. So it's nothing to do with how the funds have performed. But you got to change policyholder behavior a little bit to want to invest in those new funds under existing annuities. So I would say that we’re pursuing a number of strategies to improve the profitability of the in-force block, and that's one of them.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from UBS.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: With regard to the international business, so OIR was up 2% in premium, fees and other; Japan was down 2%. Could you give us a sense of where you expect that PFO to go in 2012. And then secondly, why do you think the margins are comparable as you increase your allocation of sales to investment products. I understand with Aflac, their margins are about 2/3 or less, the more traditional medical-type products that they're selling.
William J. Toppeta: Andrew, it's Bill Toppeta. In terms of where we think the PFOs will go next year, the total for international, as we gave you on the investor call in December, would be approximately 6%. And the breakdown on that is Japan would be a little bit above 5%, and then the other regions would be about 6.7%. So I think that there are a couple of things that will drive that going forward. The first thing I would say is a big emphasis, pretty much, in all regions on the Accident and Health business. We expect that there's going to be a strong emphasis on A&H growth in all regions. In fact, we just came back from Latin America, where there's very strong growth in A&H in a number of countries. We're seeing very strong A&H growth in Korea. So I think the trend is very good. Another point I think would be related to persistency. There are number of management actions being taken around persistency, particularly in Japan but also in other places. I think what we saw this year was a little bit of a delay in getting that started, and that was related to the earthquake. So we're probably -- and I've mentioned this before, we're probably about 3 to 4 months late on the persistency initiatives. Nonetheless, the trend is very good. The trend this year in Japan has improved persistency by about a percentage point, and that's going to benefit premiums and fees next year, of course. And we expect that there's going to be continued growth with that. So I think those are a couple of the factors that make us confident that we can achieve the premium fee growth that I outlined going forward.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then to that second question, Bill, about the margins.
William J. Toppeta: Yes.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Will the earnings go -- move in sync with these revenues?
William J. Toppeta: Yes. The margins -- actually, the margins -- this is related to the shift between FAS 60 products and FAS 97 products. The margins -- and we've looked at several of these products, the margins are every bit as good on FAS 97 products. So while you may get a lower PFO number, your profitability is going to hold.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And just to give a little more color on that persistency number. You got one point in Japan. How many more points do you think you can get going forward?
William J. Toppeta: Well, I think we probably will be looking at something like that for next year, something between say 0.5 to 0.7, maybe up to a full point of improvement depending upon how successful we are. But I think it's in that range.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then just one last point. On Japan, the A&H business, do you expect some growth in that area as well, or is it more in other regions?
William J. Toppeta: No, we absolutely expect growth. In fact, I think that A&H sales growth in Japan is expected to be strong. And I think the reason for that is a focus on distribution. So there's going to be a lot of focus on A&H in both -- well, all 3 channels. I would say, in face-to-face, we certainly are doing very well with respect to the independent agency in Japan. I think we'll get good strength there, but we'll get even bigger emphasis in the career agent force. Sale of A&H through the banks is another emphasis. And then in DM, but DM with sponsors. So I think that we're going to -- in all those channels, we expect to get good -- very good growth in A&H sales in Japan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Smith from Scotiabank.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division: Yes, a couple of questions. One is with respect to the guidance and the change -- and their changing guidance, given a different scenario of interest rates staying at current level for the full year. What factors, in your assumptions, changed that allowed you to maintain the guidance in that type of a scenario?
Eric T. Steigerwalt: You're talking about our EPS guidance for 2012?
Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division: Yes.
Eric T. Steigerwalt: So as we went through on the interest rate presentation, we have interest rate floors not only helping us, given the level of interest rates, but we had some deferred start interest rate floors that kick in, in July, and that's going to help 2012. In addition, in both our Retirement Product and our Life Insurance -- Individual Life Insurance businesses, we still have crediting rate flexibility, and you'll see that play itself out depending on what happens with interest rates during the next 4 quarters. So as we project out and as Steve said, we have done these projections, we think that the impact in 2012 will be very modest.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division: Okay. All right. And then just as a separate question. On the VAs, with respect to the lapse rates, they're really low. And I'm wondering if at this level of lapse rate, it's really within the range of your expectations, then what type of utilization rates you're expecting?
William J. Wheeler: Well, our whole product is designed with a series of assumptions about -- we use this phrase dynamic lapse rate assumptions, which means as the products get more in the money, and they're relatively in the money now even though we've had a nice rally of the stock market, just mainly because they're in low interest rates, they're in the money, or the guarantees are in the money, is that -- therefore, we assume that lapse rates will go down. And that's how the businesses -- and therefore, the accounting adjusts for that. I think utilization rates -- we assume that consumers are going to utilize or annuitize fairly efficiently. That means if they are in the money and the guarantee is valuable, they will take advantage of that. That's what -- and then we hedge accordingly. So we assume that they'll act appropriately. As a matter of real experience, I'm not sure. I think that's a very conservative assumption.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division: Okay. So you would say that 6 or so percent lapse rate at this point are within your range of expectations and that you're factoring in a further decline on that?
William J. Wheeler: Yes, absolutely. So we're -- well, so the lapse rates where they are today, we think is -- we're not surprised by that and that' sort of what -- how the product is designed and how the accounting works. And in terms of actually annuitizing, we're not seeing a lot of people at -- the very first policy holders are able now to annuitize, and it's not a big enough sample to really draw any conclusions from -- remember, because they have to wait 10 years. And the level of annuitization is very modest, and we're assuming a lot more -- well, the way we hedge, we assume more will annuitize.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I had a few questions. First, on the group disability business. Your margins were weak. I just wanted to get an idea on what your expectation is for clean recovery rates given the economy, and what you've seen in terms of competitor behavior on pricing in the disability market. And then secondly, on capital deployment, you mentioned that it could begin once you get fed approval, assuming you're referring to share buybacks. But maybe if you could discuss where acquisitions fit into your capital plans. Would you consider additional deals in the near term? And if yes, which products or markets are you most interested in? And then lastly, in the past, I think, Bill, you have mentioned hedging cost for the GMIB feature were higher through 2011 versus the fee that you were charging. Where that stands now that the market volatilities declined a little bit?
William J. Wheeler: Okay. So I'll try to do these. So I'm in a new job, Jimmy, so don't put too much pressure on me.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Well, Steve can answer some of these.
William J. Wheeler: Okay. With regard to group disability, I thought Eric explained it pretty well. Incidence rates are actually down, which is a good sign. And the claim closure rates are below plan and below expectations and actually ticked down a little bit in the fourth quarter, which is not good, and that's all about getting people back to work. And so that's very much driven by the macro factor. Where that goes from here? We hope it improves. We're not sure. What -- the way we're dealing with that, of course, is -- and the other final thing, by the way, which is just unusual, is we had some fairly high severity in our disability claims, and that's just a blip. We suspect that'll come back down to a normal level of severity, probably in the next quarter. But you never can be sure. The way we're dealing with this is obviously through pricing and obviously making sure we manage claims appropriately. We're -- because the environment is still difficult, we've been raising prices in our group disability business for a while. So that leads to the competitive environment question. Clearly, we've seen a shift in terms of group competitors, in terms of how aggressive they've been to obtain business, and that's good. We've seen that both in Group Life and in Group Disability, and I think -- so the environment is clearly from a pricing -- but getting better. Okay. Just -- I'll do the last one on hedging. As I just, I think, mentioned a few minutes ago, so our hedging costs in the fourth quarter were relatively flat with where they were in the third quarter, which means that they're higher than the fee we're charging on the rider, a little bit higher. Now that's obviously not great. But you have to always remember that we're earning a substantial fee on the base contract, and that's very important. So that's why we still make a return that's just a little south of 15% in the fourth quarter, even though these hedging costs are higher.
Steven A. Kandarian: So, Jimmy, on the capital deployment issue. As I mentioned in my remarks, we have submitted our plan to the Fed earlier this year. We expect to hear back before the end of this quarter. We feel very good about our submission. We feel very good about our capital position, and we are hopeful that we'll be able to return capital to our shareholders this year. But we must await a response from the Federal Reserve. As to what we will do with that capital, obviously, we're looking at all the possible avenues there, dividends, share buybacks, opportunistic M&A that fits our strategic direction and which provides shareholder value and which provides accretion to our earnings and markets that we think are desirable. All those things are on the table.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: I'd like to follow up on that last question. So with the CCAR submission or the submission that you've given to the Fed, that would contemplate a level of capital management that would be considerably below kind of the $6 billion to $7 billion level. So I just want to clarify the timing, and I think that it's right that you would go through the CCAR process to the extent you're still a bank holding company. And then if you can shed the bank holding company status later in the year that would open the door for more material capital management. So it's kind of a 2-step process. Is that the right way to think of it?
Steven A. Kandarian: Well, let me say this, the -- we've submitted what we're comfortable doing in terms of capital redeployment for 2012 to the Fed. And again, we can't prejudge things, but we feel good about our submission, and we are hopeful that we'll be able to execute it here over the course of the year. The numbers that we talked to you about, $6 billion to $7 billion by year end, of course, that builds over time. So that capital will be there by year end absent any deployment, well, to see what happens over the course of this year in terms of we do run the areas of dividends and share buybacks, again based upon what we hear back from the fed, and, well, to see what happens in the M&A arena over the course of the year. We look at most any property that's put up for sale. We have very strict criteria in terms of what we will pursue and what price. But as we mentioned, we have done some deals recently in Turkey, in Eastern Europe, and we'll be looking at other opportunities over the course of this year. So I can't really say exactly what we'll be doing with that full $6 billion to $7 billion we anticipate having by year end over -- I'd say it'll be a 2-year process, because a lot of this depends upon what happens in the marketplace in the M&A arena and also depends upon what kind of reaction we get from the Federal Reserve to our submission. And as you point out, we are de-banking. Process is under way. We're hopeful that will conclude sometime midyear this year. And that would put us in a different status at that point in time, and that will be taken into account in terms of how we deploy our capital as well.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: All right, understood. And one more, if I could, real quick. The strategic review is on everyone's mind, and you've been, I think, clear that May 23 is when that's going to be covered in depth. But is there any other commentary you can give? It seems like the non-U.S. A&H products are favorably mentioned here a couple of times, maybe spread-based products domestically are less in favor. Anything else you could provide there would be appreciated.
Steven A. Kandarian: We will talk at much greater length at our May call. But let me go through the -- some guiding principles. I'll give you some insights into our thinking here. So first, let me start by saying, obviously, the acquisition of Alico, $16.3 billion acquisition, transformed MetLife. We went from being a largely domestic-focused life insurance company to being a truly global business. Now a lot has to happen to catch up with that business in terms of culture, organization, and we've been doing quite a bit in that arena as you've heard from us. So that's one issue that we'll be talking more about. We've talked about how easy it is to do business with us and being more customer-centric going forward and in allowing people to interact with us on the basis that they want to. That doesn't mean excluding channels we're in now. It means, really, in addition here in terms of allowing people to interact with us on a number of different bases. Let me add also talent. We talked a lot about our talent here. You've already heard about some high-level hires to MetLife and more coming in the area of the CFO and President of Asia positions. Another issue to talk about is how we look at our businesses overall as a portfolio, both in terms of products and geographies, and making sure there's a balance there, especially when you take into account risk. So your question allude to A&H, lower capital charge kind of product, strong ROE kind of product, so obviously we want a good balance between the different products we sell. We've told you today that our guidance around VAs for 2012 is roughly $18 billion. That is down from 2011. That's related to our way of looking at risk and making sure we balance this portfolio of products that we offer to the marketplace. And finally, I'll just say in terms of guiding principles, all these things I just mentioned that are heretofore is because we're trying to drive shareholder value. That's the bottom line. And if we do all those things well, we will drive shareholder value, and we're confident we can do that.
John McCallion: Great. Well, thank you, everyone for joining us today, and enjoy the rest of your day. And I'll turn it back to Greg. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results, and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John McCallion, Head of Investor Relations.
John McCallion: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2011 earnings call. Before I start, let me briefly outline the logistics of today's call. We have a 2-hour call today divided into 2 sessions. The first session will focus on our third quarter 2011 results, which will end promptly at 8:55 a.m. We will take a 10-minute break, at which time the phones will be placed on musical hold. Then at 9:05 a.m., we will host a discussion to address market concerns about the potential long-term, low-interest rate environment in the U.S. Presentation materials for this interest rate discussion are currently available at MetLife.com through a link on the Investor Relations page. Now let's get started.  We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of MetLife.com and our earnings press release, our quarterly financial supplements and in the other financial section. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative in gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Wheeler, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also, here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management, including Bill Toppeta, President of International business; Bill Mullaney, President of U.S. Business; Steve Goulart; Chief Investment Officer; and Donna DeMaio, President of MetLife Bank. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss this quarter's results, I'd like to comment on our recent annual dividend declaration. Earlier this week, we declared an annual common stock dividend of $0.74 per share for 2011. As we announced, we recently submitted a capital distribution plan to the Federal Reserve for approval that included both an increase in MetLife's annual dividend, as well as the resumption of stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve has concluded that the company's planned capital actions should be tested under a revised adverse macroeconomic scenario, which is being developed for those firms that will participate in the 2012 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review. As a result, the Federal Reserve did not approve the company's planned dividend increase and other proposed capital actions at this time. We are disappointed that we cannot commence increased capital actions now. Our analysis shows that the company's current capital level and financial strength support capital action increases. Moreover, we believe increasing our capital actions in this time of high unemployment would prove beneficial to the economy as our shareholders redeploy these funds in a productive manner. We look forward to seeking and gaining the approval of our capital plan from the Federal Reserve early next year. We are firmly committed to creating shareholder value and returning capital to our shareholders. In addition, we continue to move forward on our plans to explore the sale of the depository business and the forward mortgage origination business conducted at MetLife Bank and to take the necessary steps to no longer be a bank holding company. As I have previously noted, this will ensure that MetLife is able to operate on a level regulatory playing field with other insurance companies. Now let's discuss this quarter's results. Despite some significant economic headwinds during the quarter, MetLife delivered earnings per share of $1.11, up 3% from the prior-year quarter. As noted in the 8-K we filed on October 6, MetLife recorded a number of onetime charges in the third quarter. Absent these charges and some other onetime items, MetLife's earnings would have been $1.28 per share, which we believe is closer to the company's true earnings power. In addition, our annualized operating return on equity of 10.9% for the first 9 months of the year would have been 11.5% without onetime items. Now let me turn to some of the broader issues facing the market. First, while Europe remains unsettled, we believe our exposure is manageable, especially given the number of actions we have taken over the past year. Out of a general account asset pool of $493 billion, our exposure to peripheral Europe sovereign debt was $571 million on a book value basis as of September 30, down from $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2010. And our exposure at quarter end to European banks was $6.9 billion, down significantly from year end. In addition, our total $42 billion of European exposure, more than 90% is investment grade. We have provided greater detail on our exposure to Europe in the appendix to the presentation deck for our call at 9:05 a.m. Second, the variable annuity market continues to experience strong growth. While the market in our sales grew substantially in the third quarter, we are taking a proactive approach to managing growth of our variable annuity business. As you know, we recently adjusted our GMIB Max offering to reduce risk and improve returns, and we will be making further adjustments in January. While we are comfortable with the pricing and returns on our third quarter VA sales, we continue to seek opportunities to reprice and improve the risk profile of our product offerings. As of January, the roll-up rate on a GMIB Max product will be reduced from 5.5% to 5%. We are closely monitoring sales, and if they rise above plan, there are steps we can take and will take to bring sales in line. You can be assured that we are reviewing all of our product features to maintain a disciplined balance between customer value, risk and return. As a matter of sound capital management, we will only pursue growth that we believe maximizes long-term shareholder value. And third, while interest rates have rebounded somewhat since the announcement of Operation Twist, they still remain at low levels. While long-term low interest rates have an impact in our earnings, we have taken proactive steps to mitigate this impact. We will talk much more about this topic during the special one-hour teleconference following today's earnings call. For now, I would simply note that even if a 10-year treasury remained at 2% for the next 5 years, MetLife would still expect to grow earnings and generate excess capital. One reason is our focus on risk management. For example, as Steve Goulart will discuss in the second hour, we purchased $18 billion of notional interest rate floors in 2004 and 2005 to protect against sustained low-rate environment. Finally, let me cover a few highlights from this quarter. We are extremely pleased with the performance of our International business and believe that it will continue to drive profitable growth for the enterprise. Total international sales were up 25%, including a 28% increase in Japan sales compared with MetLife's and Alico's combined results from the third quarter of 2010. Our business in Japan continues to recover from the impact of the March earthquake and tsunami.  International businesses operating earnings in the quarter reached $578 million and solid performance in Latin America and Asia Pacific. In these regions, our accident and health products, which have low capital requirements and attractive returns, are making a strong contribution to our bottom line. Recently, we launched a new stand-alone whole life product, which is the only cancer-specialized product available in Korea, offering both a whole life feature and additional protection for secondary cancer diagnosis.  The integration of Alico is proceeding well. On October 3, almost 17 months after changing MetLife's long-term ratings outlook to negative, on news of our agreement to purchase Alico, Moody's returned our ratings outlook to stable. In upgrading MetLife's ratings outlook, Moody's pointed to, among other things, our substantial progress and success with the integration of Alico. In the United States, premiums and fees grew 9%, primarily driven by higher pension closeouts and structured settlement sales in the Corporate Benefit Funding segment. In addition, we continue to maintain the leading position in the group insurance market. Underwriting results improved, particularly in the Dental business as we maintained our disciplined approach to underwriting.  In summary, I believe MetLife is well positioned to create long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler to cover our third quarter results in greater detail. Bill?
William J. Wheeler: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. MetLife reported net income of $3.6 billion or $3.33 per share and operating earnings of $1.2 billion or $1.11 per share for the third quarter. There were several unusual items in this quarter. First, we have taken an after-tax charge of $117 million or $0.11 per share to increase reserves in connection with our use of the U.S. Social Security Administration's Death Master File and similar databases to identify potential life insurance claims for pending and incurred but not reported claim liabilities referred to as IBNR. Over 70% of the charges in our Group Life business, nearly 25% in Individual Life with the balance in Corporate Benefit Funding. Next, our Auto & Home business incurred catastrophe losses of $88 million after-tax in the quarter, including the impact of Hurricane Irene. This result was $50 million after-tax or $0.05 per share above our third quarter plan provision of $38 million. Partially offsetting the impact of the cats, Auto & Home had a favorable prior-year development reserve release in its Auto business of $19 million or $0.02 per share. Also, we have recorded a $40 million after-tax charge or $0.04 per share related to MetLife's obligations under the New York State liquidation plan for Executive Life Insurance Company of New York, which we call ELNY. This charge has been recorded in our corporate and other segment.  Pretax variable investment income was $400 million after-taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs. Variable investment income was $37 million or $0.03 per share, above the top of our Investor Day guidance, driven by strong securities lending and private equity returns, which more than offset weakness in our hedge fund performance. I should remind you that we report our private equities on a one-quarter lag, while hedge funds are reported on a one-month lag. Therefore, we would expect that our private equity portfolio would be negatively impacted in the fourth quarter based on the market performance in the third quarter. Adjusting for the items that I just mentioned and a few other minor adjustments that also impacted this quarter, our normalized operating earnings was $1.28 per share, and our normalized ROE for the first 9 months was 11.5%. In addition, Retirement Products earnings were negatively affected by the 14% decline in the S&P 500 in the quarter. The initial market impact as a result of a higher DAC amortization cost the segment $90 million after-tax or $0.08 per share this quarter. Clearly, there were a number of unusual items in the quarter. However, when you strip those out, I believe our results are quite strong, reflecting good underlying fundamentals in a challenging environment. Now let's take a look at the results in the quarter by line of business. U.S. business reported operating earnings of $655 million for the third quarter. Excluding the impact of unusual items in this quarter, normalized earnings for U.S. business was $768 million. If you exclude the initial market impact of $90 million after-tax in the quarter, U.S. business operating earnings were up 7% versus normalized operating earnings in the prior-year period. U.S. business had strong top line growth in the quarter as premiums, fees and other revenue were $7.7 billion, up 9% from the prior-year quarter, driven by solid closeout and structured settlement sales in Corporate Benefit Funding, and strong net flows in our Retirement Products business due to variable annuity sales and continued low lapse rates. While the insurance products top line was essentially flat this quarter, we are having a good 2012 sales and renewal season as favorable pricing trends are slowly returning to the group insurance market. Insurance products' normalized earnings of $362 million is up 9% over the prior-year quarter. This strong performance reflects the improved Non-Medical Health underwriting margins, a better individual expense margin and continued solid interest margins. The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 98.5%. It's elevated due to the reserve strengthening related to the life insurance claims adjustment that I mentioned previously. Adjusting for this item, the loss ratio was 88.9%, near the low end of the 2011 guidance range of 88% to 93%, and in line versus the prior-year quarter of 89%. Overall, we are pleased with Group Life steady underwriting results reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline.  The Non-Medical Health total benefits ratio for the quarter was 86.6%, which was down from the prior-year quarter of 88% and well within our 2011 guidance of 86% to 90%. Results in Dental continue to improvise as we execute the second year of our re-margining strategy. We are seeing more stable utilization and favorable price trends. Disability results improved significantly versus a very poor quarter last year. Incidents, recoveries and offsets on open claims were all better versus the third quarter of 2010.  Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 98.5%, elevated due to the reserve strengthening related to the life insurance claims adjustment that I mentioned previously. On a normalized basis, the mortality loss ratio was 89%, up from the prior-year quarter of 86.7% and above plan due to higher large base claims in the quarter. I should point out that we introduced a new higher-priced ULSG product in the third quarter. However, as the old product was still available in the quarter, we saw UL sales somewhat elevated. We would expect to see lower UL sales going forward. Turning to our Auto & Home business, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 105.7% for the third quarter, which was up over the prior-year quarter's results of 93.6% due to unusually heavy storm activity, including the impact from Hurricane Irene. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 88% in the third quarter versus 88.2% in the prior-year period. Auto & Home operating earnings were significantly impacted by the cat impact this quarter as well, as other related non-catastrophe losses. I should note that this has already been the worst catastrophe year in the history of the company, and despite that fact, our Auto & Home business is expected to pay a dividend up to the holding company before the end of the year. Auto & Home's premiums, fees and other revenues were up 3% on solid growth fundamentals and favorable pricing trends in the market. We will look to take further pricing actions consistent with the market. Retirement products' operating earnings were down significantly due to the 14% drop in the S&P 500 this quarter. This negatively impacted the segment by $90 million after-tax due to higher DAC amortization. Premiums, fees and other revenue were up 39% from the prior-year quarter driven by strong net flows due to variable annuity sales of $8.6 billion and continued low lapse rates. Also, our hedging program continues to perform well despite the very volatile markets.  Corporate Benefit Funding operating earnings were up 45% over the prior-period quarter driven by higher net investment income coming from both variable and recurring income. Premiums, fees and other revenues were up 65% due to higher closeouts both in the U.S. and the U.K. and structured settlement sales. Now let's move to International business. International reported operating earnings in the third quarter of $578 million, up from $189 million in the prior-year quarter, largely due to the acquisition of Alico and the strong growth in the business, particularly in the Latin American and Asia Pacific regions. To give you a better sense of International's overall growth for the quarter, our International revenues were $4 billion. This is approximately 11% higher than the third quarter of 2010 on a combined basis, as if we had owned Alico in both periods, and it's 3% higher on a constant currency basis. In addition, we continue to see strong sales growth for the business. The sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter represent year-over-year and sequential growth of 25% and 9%, respectively, on a constant rate basis.  In Japan, operating earnings were $315 million, up 29% over the second quarter of 2011 due to higher net investment income, reduced claims from the March earthquake, lower operating expenses and improved persistency. The year-over-year increase in revenues on a combined basis was approximately 13%, driven largely by the favorable exchange rate of the yen versus the U.S. dollar and higher persistency. On a constant rate basis, revenues were up 2%. Japan sales recovered strongly in the quarter at $534 million, up 28% year-over-year on a constant rate basis and 22% over the sequential quarter. Sales increased in all product and distribution channels with the stronger gains coming from the bank channel and in whole life and fixed annuities. In the other international regions, operating earnings were $263 million, up 39% driven by the Alico acquisition and growth in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. Overall, the key business drivers included solid underwriting, improved persistency, lower operating expenses and a focus on high ROI products.  The year-over-year increase in revenues on a combined basis was approximately 10% for the region, with strong revenue growth in both Latin America and Asia Pacific driving these results. In Latin America, premiums, fees and other revenue were up 10% year-over-year, highlighted by strong sales in accident and health in Argentina and Chile and the pension business in Mexico. Overall, persistency remains strong for the region. Asia Pacific revenue is up 11% year-over-year driven by group sales in Australia and persistency improvements in Korea. On a constant rate basis, revenues were up 4% year-over-year while sales were up 23% on a constant rate basis, a very strong result. Overall, our International business had a very good quarter and continues to perform well in spite of the challenging global environment. We are realizing the value and growth expected from the Alico acquisition and we are delivering on our commitments. Diversification of geography, products and distribution has positioned International to withstand recessionary pressures.  Moving to expenses, our operating expense ratio for the quarter was 23.2% and 20.3% when excluding the impact of MetLife Bank in pension and postretirement benefits. Both ratios are below our 2011 guidance of 23.5% to 24.1% and 21.2% to 21.7%, respectively. Overall, a very good result. Turning to our investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity and equity securities were $19.8 billion, up from $11 billion last quarter. Please keep in mind that interest rate-driven unrealized gains and losses in our investment portfolio are generally offset by changes in the economic value of our liabilities.  With regard to realized investment gains and losses, in the third quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net gains of $14 million. Included in this net gain, our impairments of $167 million after-tax, of which $134 million after-tax relate to our the Greek sovereign debt holdings. With respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had net after-tax gains of $2.7 billion. The impact of MetLife's own credit spreads contributed $1.3 billion after-tax, while lower interest rates was the other key driver. As a reminder, derivative gains and losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact of the company. These large derivative gains had a significant and somewhat unintended impact on our overall portfolio yield for the quarter, as a result of the mechanics of the yield calculation. The overall portfolio yield fell by 20 basis points from 4.83% in Q2 to 4.63% this period. Approximately 1/2 of this yield decline relates to the substantial increase in derivative asset values coupled with the related increase in cash collateral that we received from our derivative counterparties.  Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of our investment portfolio and feel it is well positioned to deal with the challenging macro environment, including the potential sustained flat rate environment. Steve Goulart will provide you with more details in our investment portfolio shortly. Now I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for domestic insurance companies for the third quarter of 2011 was approximately a $5 million loss and $117 million gain, respectively. The results in the quarter were impacted by higher reserves related to the market performance in the quarter and other nonrecurring items, which we mentioned earlier. While reserve adjustments go through the income statement, the hedges in our derivatives portfolio do not go to the income statement but are rather reflected in unrealized gains. Therefore, our total adjusted capital or TAC increased by $2.3 billion in the quarter, primarily due to unrealized gains on derivatives and other invested assets and now stands at $28.7 billion as of September 30. For the first 9 months of 2011, statutory operating earnings and statutory net income was approximately $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. On a year-to-date basis, this is about in line with our expectations. In addition, our international capital position is strong with Alico Japan's reported second quarter solvency margin ratio on the 2012 basis is 896%. While the third quarter has not been reported, we do expect to see similar levels. Cash and liquid assets at the holding company at September 30 were approximately $3.3 billion. Last quarter, we provided an estimate of year-end 2011 holding company excess capital of about $5 billion, which continues to be in line. This excess was before capital management actions and assumed the $1 billion liquidity buffer. Of this total, we plan to use $750 million to repay maturing debt and about $780 million for common dividend payments in December of this year, which leaves a little bit over $3 billion of additional holding company excess capital at year end. In summary, MetLife had a very good third quarter in spite of the ongoing challenging environment. Now before I turn over to the operator for questions, John McCallion has asked me, due to time constraints, that you limit yourself to one question and only one, and only one follow-up which relates to your initial question, make sure they relate. Now I'd like to turn it back to the operator. Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: The variable annuities clearly benefited from trying to get the current roll-up rate. What do you think that contributed in the quarter?
William J. Mullaney: Jay, it's Bill Mullaney. Is your question about specifically, do I think the higher roll-up rate contributed to higher sales? Is that your question?
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I'm pretty sure that is the case. I mean with $9 billion of sales in the quarter, what do you think is a reasonable run rate going forward?
William J. Mullaney: Well, as you know, we're taking some steps to bring the roll-up rate down and we set the roll-up rate on Max. It was very early in the year when interest rates were higher and there were some competitor products out there at 6%. We wanted Max to get good traction in the market and so we set a 6% roll-up rate. And then obviously, the macroeconomic environment changed by the time that product got in the market which, obviously, made it quite attractive, and that was a big contributor to the overall sales level in the third quarter. In addition, we did announce that we were bringing the roll-up rate down to 5.5%, so there is some fire sale impact in the third quarter as a result of that. So I think for the fourth quarter, you can expect to see sales be lower than they were in the third quarter probably in the $7 billion to $7.5 billion range. Again, you're going to see some fire sale impact because the changes didn't take place until the second week in October. And so we saw a pretty heavy volume on the 6% product in the first couple of weeks of October. But then the run rate will obviously come down as a result of being in 5.5%.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right. And so would you think maybe $5 billion run rate going into early 2012 on a quarterly basis is good for a placeholder?
William J. Mullaney: Yes. I would say it's probably in that range. That's a good way to look at it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I had a question also on variable annuities. Bill, maybe if you could talk about given the equity market volatility is in cost of option, does the price of your charging for guarantees, is that enough to cover the cost of hedging? And it doesn't seem like it would be but -- and if it isn't, are you planning on taking any actions at some point? How are you looking at that?
William J. Mullaney: Yes. Jimmy, we're looking very closely at that. For the third quarter, because of the volatility in the markets, the cost to hedge for the overall book was slightly above the fees that we were charging for the hedges. So we are monitoring that pretty closely. And over time, if edging cost don't come back in line, we would take some steps to adjust our fees.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then just cheating a little bit, I guess. On variable annuities also, Bill Wheeler mentioned that there was about an $0.08 hit because of a higher DAC. I think as Steve's comments mentioned, $1.28 as a normal run rate. In the past, you've added any market-related items to your estimate of run rate because that shouldn't repeat going forward, but just wondering why you view $1.28 as a run rate as opposed to $1.36?
William J. Wheeler: So Jimmy, I mean, I think the answer to that is pretty simple. We actually generally don't add back market impact one way or another. And I think the only time I can remember that we did adjust for it is when we had a huge change in the performance of the stock market. So we actually did debate whether or not we should kind of add this to normalizing run rate. But I guess my feeling is, is that markets move up and down, that's a part of the business we're in. And unless it truly distorted the number, it shouldn't be adjusted.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Because I'm looking at the list of that number, list of numbers you gave us in the third quarter of last year, and this is one of the items that you'd mentioned.
William J. Wheeler: Well, I can't remember the third quarter of the last year right at the top of my head. But I'm not -- there isn't some special message there. We decided...
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So it's like $0.05 that third quarter of $43 million?
William J. Wheeler: Okay. What we'll do is, I mean -- we thought we'll give people the information. Obviously, we'll quantify the market impact and let them decide what they should normalize.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: But as we think about that business, that $0.08 is specifically related to DAC and not lower fees or something else that might be ongoing, right?
William J. Wheeler: I'm sorry, can you just say it one more time.
Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: The $0.08 in the annuity business was specifically related to DAC and it's not lower fees or anything else that might be ongoing?
William J. Wheeler: That's correct. That's exactly right.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Giovanni from Goldman Sachs.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just one question regarding sort of the decision by the Fed. Any way you can provide any insight into terms of kind of what you went to the Fed with? And then around that same tone, any reason not to go to the board and get the approval from the board for what internally you guys are comfortable deploying and sharing that with investors?
Steven A. Kandarian: This is Steve. The Fed process is one in which a disclosure around their supervisor information is not permitted. Some of the language you heard from us actually was approved specifically by the Fed for us to give to you because we felt that given their action, we really needed to say more than simply we can't raise our dividend. So the language we gave you is pretty much all we can tell you about the inter-workings of this process. We're simply not allowed to give you more than what we've given so far. So I'm sorry to limit it, but it's not our decision in terms of what can be disclosed.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Can you just talk some about the conversations you and the board are having in terms of internally, what you guys might be thinking is comfortable in terms of deployment?
Steven A. Kandarian: I think it's not a wise thing for us in the middle of this process with the Fed to start putting out those numbers. We're working with the Fed closely, you can be assured our board and we, management, are in sync on this issue. We want to return capital to our shareholders as soon as possible. We're working hard with the Fed to enable that to happen.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Devine from Citigroup.
Colin W. Devine - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I have sort of 3 small ones. Bill, first, you mentioned stat earnings. Can you just, I guess, quantify what the strain was from the very large VA sales? Because it seemed to me that was the bigger driver of why you actually reported a stat loss. Second, can you confirm that the -- I didn't catch it in the opening remarks, that the guarantee step-up on the VA is now since been lowered to 5%, so I would assume maybe for Bill Mullaney, we're going to continue to have a fire sale at least through this quarter until you to get that product off. And then lastly, Bill, what if you can't sell the bank, what are you going to do?
William J. Wheeler: Okay. You have 3 questions. So I'll answer 1 and 3 and then I'll let Mr. Mullaney answer 2. So with regard to stat earnings, yes. So we did report basically a breakeven stat operating earnings quarter. And you're right, it was driven. The breakeven number was driven by the fact that we did have to increase some of our stat reserves because of the VA not just the sales necessarily, the strain from the sales, but because of the market performance in the third quarter. And that order of magnitude after tax was $400 million, $500 million. Now keep in mind that the hedging offset to that, and that's what I tried to say in my prepared remarks is, doesn't actually flow through the income statement. But it does -- it shows up later in our statutory financials. Stat is strange. And if you picked all of our hedging, including the hedging related to the VAs, obviously, we had a very, very big stat gain with regard to total adjusted capital. So yes, we did have some strain caused by market performance in the variable annuity block, but it was, obviously, substantially offset by hedging activity.
Colin W. Devine - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I'm getting at the commissions, Bill. I mean, I'm thinking 6% on almost $9 billion of sales, seems that's the biggest swing factor.
William J. Wheeler: Well, yes, you do have ongoing strain. But remember, just keep in mind that we have a very large variable annuity block, which we have ongoing fees. So yes, so we have decent stat strain from commissions every quarter, right? But obviously, our inforce sort of overwhelms that number in terms of the profits we get. So with regard to the bank, look, I would just say we talked about a sale process. That sale process is on track, and so we're confident we will be able to sell the bank. But if we do have a -- if for some reason that doesn't happen or we would probably Plan B, though I think this would be in the extreme scenario, is we would wind it down, but I think a sale is much more likely.
William J. Mullaney: It's Bill Mullaney. So let me just add a little color to what Steve Kandarian said with his opening remarks about VAs. So we made a decision to drop the roll-up rate to 5.5%. That was effective in the middle of October. And then we since filed to bring our roll-up rate down to 5% and that change will take place in the first quarter. It's actually due first week of January of 2012. And so yes, I think the fourth quarter will be somewhat noisy. The run rate of VA sales just on the 5.5% product, a fire sale impact from going from 6% to 5.5% and there will be some, though I think a less of a fire sale impact going from 5.5% to 5%. A couple of points I'd make. The sales at 5.5%, the return on those sales are good. The ROIs are around 15%. And so even in the fourth quarter or in the third quarter, at the 9/30 capital markets, the returns on the products were about 14% on the Max product. The Max was over 2/3 of our VA sales in the third quarter. And by moving down to 5%, it also reduces our hedging costs and hedging costs are already reduced in the Max product because some of the hedging is being done inside the funds. So we think that the steps we're taking to bring the roll-up rate down will get us to an appropriate level of sales going into 2012.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Smith from Scotia Capital.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotia Capital Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to talk about -- I have so many things I want talk about, and I know I'm only allowed one question. So I'm going to talk about non-bank SIFI. So let's say that you get the bank sold and you're designated a non-bank SIFI, it seems to me that the regulatory trends in this country are getting more and more tight, to say the least. And so what do you think the implications are for any insurance company that's designated a non-bank SIFI if you're having so much trouble as a bank holding company getting your capital plan approved. Does that imply that there might be some constraints under the non-bank SIFI categorization?
Steven A. Kandarian: Obviously,, at this point, no one knows exactly who will be designated a non-bank SIFI or if you are designated, what the rules will be. And I suspect we won't know who's designated till some time in 2012. And as to what it means, it might even be 2013. So that's just a guess on my part, but that seems to be the direction things are going in. The hope is, over time, people in Washington will understand the difference between the banking business model and the insurance industry business model. And they are quite different. Very different liquidity, factors in terms of what kinds of liabilities they have. It's just a very different business model. One of the challenges is, Washington has not regulated insurance. The states have. And the level of understanding of our industry is relatively limited. It's growing, but it's relatively limited at this point in time. And we and others in the industry are working hard to help those in Washington making these policies better understand the differences in these models. And if we are designated a non-bank SIFI, what might be the appropriate way to regulate that group of companies. At the end of the day, we are discussing this issue at length with people in Washington and we're trying to make sure they understand the importance of a level regulatory field for our industry, so that they don't simply pluck out a few companies and say you are non-bank SIFI and everyone else is not. So that's also very important to us, and the story is unfolding over, really, years here, and our hope is we get to the right answer at the end of the day. But no one knows at this point how this will sort out.
Joanne A. Smith - Scotia Capital Inc., Research Division: What worries me, Steve, is that the federal government seems to think they know the banking system very well, and they really kind of messed that up. So, I certainly hope that there's a good education process that happens of the next year or so for the insurance industry because that could just be a mess.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein from Evercore Partners.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: So I'm actually going to use my follow-up to follow-up on Colin's question and then a real question. Can you just explain one thing which is, if the hedging costs exceed the rider fee, it's a little counterintuitive that the projected margins on Q3 sales, and I assume into Q4, that the returns would be in the mid-teens. I guess, one, can you explain that? And two, are you fully hedging the product and is that incorporated in that mid-teen projected return on Q3 sales?
William J. Mullaney: Mark, it's Bill Mullaney. The bank's contract is performing well in the annuity business. So even though the rider fees are slightly below the cost of hedging, we're still able to generate the returns that I talked about earlier.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. Bill Wheeler, you gave a comment on private equity into the fourth quarter, I don't think that's a huge surprise. But you also mentioned that sec lending was fairly strong. Can you just talk a little bit about securities lending and what is the outlook on that revenue stream and how sustainable is it?
William J. Wheeler: Maybe I'll pass it over to Steve Goulart.
Steven J. Goulart: Let me comment on private equity and sec lending. For private equity, as Bill said, we had very good returns this quarter. But given the lag in that and given what happened in the third quarter equity markets, we do expect that to fall off in the fourth quarter. And we wanted everyone to realize that again just reminding you that there's a lag in our performance, and so we'll probably see that in the fourth quarter. Sec lending continues to be very stable and very strong for us, and over the near term, we don't see that really changing. Our balances remain pretty flat and margins still remain very positive. The curve has seen some compression, but given our investment strategies and low cost of funds, we're able to maintain the spreads that we have in our business. And like I said, we foresee that continuing in the near future.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from UBS.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I'm going to go with the Colin Devine 3, including 2 easy ones. One, the tax rate, it was 26.4%. I think at the beginning of the year, you guided for 32%. So should I consider the difference an unusual? Second, on the SIFI item. The regulator, let's say your designated a SIFI, would your regulator be the Fed or would it still be your insurance regulator? And then, more extensive, on the International. Your PFO, you mentioned, was 3%. Would that -- I think with some of the asset dispositions that would have been closer to, say, 6%, 7%, 8%, if you kind of normalize it, is that right? And what kind of revenue outlook are you expecting?
William J. Wheeler: This is Bill Wheeler. I'll do the tax thing really quickly. I think our projected tax rate that we said at the beginning of the year would be about -- effective tax rate would be about 30% because earnings are coming in just a little bit lower, mainly because of a lot of the one timers we've talked about of this call. We've moved the effective tax rate down to 29% for the year and the catch-up occurred this quarter. So that's why you see the dip to 26%. So it's a true up basically based on what's happened the last 2 quarters but still just getting the overall tax rate down to 29%.
Steven A. Kandarian: Andrew, it's Steve. On the SIFI question, we'd be regulated both by the Fed and we continue to be regulated by the state regulators. So it would be both.
William J. Toppeta: It's Bill Toppeta, Andrew. So let me start for context and go back to last year's Investor Day on the question of premiums and fees, and if you recall what we said at that point was overall for the International segment. We called out that sales growth would be 22% premium and fee growth would be 8%, and the combination of those 2 would lead to earnings growth of 16% for this year. So where do we stand now? I would say, simply put, we're right on track for the earnings growth, which I think is the most important. We're also on track for the sales growth. The premium and fee growth, as you said, correct, is on a constant rate basis, 3%. So we're short. So here's why. In the Legacy MetLife business, we have intentionally not renewed some large group cases. I can think of a few in particular, one in Mexico, a large one; one in Australia. On the basis that they did not meet our profitability targets. So those cases, I would say, would account for about 3%. Also, as you pointed out, we've been making dispositions during the course of the year, and I think it's important for me to tell you what is our planning process with respect to acquisitions and dispositions. And that is simply that we don't include anything in the plan unless it's actually done, okay. So even though we're very certain that we're going to dispose of something, as long as we still own it at a time of the plan, we put it in the plan and we put it into the full year. Same thing is true for acquisitions. So we have been making dispositions during the course of this year, things like Taiwan, things like the closed block in the U.K., things like Venezuela. And those dispositions -- and I would say one other thing, softness in the credit life business in Europe, all those things account for almost the remaining 2%. So I think that gets you from the 3% to the 8% that we talked about on Investor Day. Now the only other item that I would mention here is that one more thing, in some countries, we are seeing a change in product mix from FAS 60 products to FAS 97 products, which tends to dampen premium and fee growth. Now generally, I would say our experience tells us that, that kind of thing is usually cyclical and not permanent. That's one piece to remember. The second thing I would say is on the margins and the ROEs on our FAS 97 products, they're just as good or better than on our FAS 60 products. So the product mix shift does not affect profitability. But I would say this is also -- and I spoke about this on the last quarter conference call a little bit, this is also why I think to get a fuller picture of our business, of really what's going on in the business, it's important not just to look at premiums and fees, but it's also important to look at sales, to look at persistency and to look at other metrics. So that gives you a fuller picture. I hope I'm being responsive to your question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Just hoping to get an update on the DAC, 09G changes, if you have any estimates or color you can provide on the book value or earnings impact?
William J. Wheeler: We are going to give those estimates on Investor Day in early December. We're not quite ready to give people, I think, a refined estimate. Just a little color, of course, the thing that will impact us, more than others is maybe the fact that we have a substantial amount of VOBA which has been created through our acquisitions over the past number of years. So we do expect that earnings drag, though we'd be able to quantify that more clearly in early December.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Is the VOBA issue more related to the recent Alico acquisition or is it kind of balanced across all the acquisitions over the years?
William J. Wheeler: Well, it's more about Alico, but that's only because Alico is the biggest and the most recent. Obviously, VOBA has been created on other acquisitions like travelers and such.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: And so that VOBA was kind of branch distribution heavy or like a controlled distribution heavy? Is that a fair way to describe the Alico business?
William J. Wheeler: No, no. VOBA -- remember DAC gets wiped out in purchase accounting and it's replaced by VOBA. VOBA is value of business acquired, so it's really sort of determining the value of the in-force block based on various discount rates and hurdle returns. That's how VOBA gets built.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Jeffrey Schuman from KBW.
Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I just want to come back for clarification on the non-bank SIFIs. I think Steve said that non-bank SIFIs would answer to the Fed. But I was wondering about the role of the FSOC. The FSOC clearly determines who is a non-bank SIFI. But do they have any role in determining how they're regulated by the Fed or what the capital standards are or anything like that?
Steven A. Kandarian: FSOC is going to been involved in determining whether you're a non-bank SIFI but the regulation will be by the Fed going forward, if you're designated as such.
Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Because I was wondering, obviously, you have insurance representation on the FSOC. But I guess if they were to hand you over to the Fed, then I guess that influence doesn't continue.
John McCallion: Okay. Thank you. Greg, and everyone on the phone, we'll take a 10-minute break, and we will come back to you at 9:05. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, you'll now hear music. Please stay on the line.
Operator: Your host, John McCallion, is back on the line.
John McCallion: Thank you, Greg. We apologize, everyone. We had some technical difficulties with AT&T. But welcome back and we're going to get through this session of the call. For this session of the call, we'll be referring to the interest rate presentation materials that can be found on the Investor Relations portion of MetLife.com.  Before I start, before we start, let me refer you to the safe harbor statement on Slide 2, and this governs the statements made on today's call. As the statement notes, any and all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. For a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the risk factors in our 10-K and 10-Q reports filed with the SEC.  Starting on Slide 3, let me remind you that we will be using non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Slide 3 and 4 explain how we calculate these measures and the reasons we believe they are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve Kandarian.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, John. Slide 5 contains our agenda for today. After some opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler, who will go through the low interest rate scenario in detail, highlighting where we have exposure and why our earnings will still be expected to grow but at a slower pace. Steve Goulart will then describe the proactive steps we have taken to protect our portfolio from the impact of low interest rates including our purchase of derivatives that provide significant low rate protection that extends well into the next decade. Finally, Bill Mullaney will briefly cover some additional business actions that could be taken to address low interest rates, should they persist.  As to recent actions, we have mentioned on our previous call that we're reducing the roll-up rate on our GMIB Max product to 5% in January. My hope is that by the end of this hour, you will have a deeper appreciation of MetLife's ability to continue to grow earnings and capital, even if interest rates remain at current levels for a number of years.  Now let's turn to Slide 6. Like most major life insurers, MetLife has been trading in tight correlation to the yield on a 10-year treasury note. However, I believe the market has overreacted to the impact low rates have on our business. So I thought I would take a few moments to discuss the key reasons why MetLife can still prosper in a low-rate environment. First, MetLife is well diversified across products, distribution channels and geography. It is truly one of our real strengths. Second, risk management is fundamental to how we run the business. It starts with prudent product design and continues through asset liability management, which is a key reason why low interest rates have a relatively modest impact on our financial performance. In addition, we continue to leverage our private asset origination capabilities and look to opportunistically deploy derivatives to protect against difficult economic environments. That's why we started purchasing interest rate floors in 2004 on a 10-year treasury traded above 4%. Through proactive portfolio management, we are well positioned to navigate through difficult economic environments, whether it's a financial crisis that started in 2008 or a period of sustained low interest rates. Slide 7 is a useful reminder of how diverse our business is from an earnings perspective. Currently, nearly 40% of our earnings are generated outside the United States. Over time, we believe this number will move closer to parity. Most of our international products are not particularly sensitive to interest rates or equity markets. They are primarily protection products where we assume insurance risks rather than market risks. In addition, many parts of our U.S. business are not entirely impacted by low interest rates. While all of our products have some sensitivity rates, significant interest rate sensitivity is concentrated in 3 areas. And here they are: Group Life, Individual Life and our Retirement Products segment. To be clear, it is not all parts of these businesses. However, these are businesses and products in which we provide some minimum rate guarantees. As a result, in a sustained low interest rate environment, these products will experience spread compression. That doesn't mean that we don't make money in these products. It just means that our earnings growth rate will be dampened.  You may have noticed that we did not mention certain long tail products such as long-term care and those in Corporate Benefit Funding. While there is reinvestment risk with these products, you will see later in this presentation that because of tight asset liability management and prudent hedging, the financial impact of low rates on these products is very modest. Now let's turn to Slide 9. The blue line is the 4 quarter moving average of a blended 5-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. As you can see in the chart, back in 2000, when we became a public company, the blended rate was around 6%. These rates have come down significantly over the past decade and recently had been in the 2% to 3% range. The red line in this chart represents the unweighted average of the annualized spreads shown in our quarterly financial supplement for Group Life; Variable and Universal Life; Non-Medical Health; deferred annuities, which is part of our Retirement Products segment; and Corporate Benefit Funding. While our spreads have fluctuated largely due to the performance of variable investment income, core spreads have been relatively stable over time. You can see that the average spread over the entire period shown, reflected by the gray line, is around 200 basis points. This didn't happen by accident. It is a result of our making effective use of the management tools I mentioned earlier, prudent product design, ALM, hedging, risk management and managing the company for the long run. Turning to Slide 10, let me first describe the assumptions we used to create this analysis. We held interest rates flat for the next 5 years with a 10-year treasury yield of 2%. And we held the slope of the treasury yield curve constant as well. Then to gauge the impact of this scenario, we compared the results to a base case, which is the June 2011 forward curve consensus. In the base case, the 10-year treasury starts at 3% and increases to 4.5% by 2013. We also assumed an S&P 500 growth rate of 5%. In addition, GDP growth remained slow and there is no material change to the current unemployment rate. Nor do we assume any extraordinary management actions to counteract this environment. The intent is to isolate the impact of low interest rates. Turning to Slide 11. Here is a summary of the results of our analysis. Overall earnings for MetLife will continue to grow but at a slower rate. While U.S. business earnings will remain relatively flat, this will be offset by the limited impact of low rates on our international earnings. I should note, while we would not be required to strengthen statutory capital reserves, we might make modest adjustments as we have in the past.  Finally, on a GAAP basis, we'd expect no loss recognition over the next 5 years but some impact to DAC and goodwill. All in all, we think the impact of a sustained low-rate environment on our financial performance is quite manageable. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler who will walk you through our analysis in greater detail. Bill?
William J. Wheeler: Thanks, Steve, and good morning again, everybody. Steve just walked you through the assumptions for this analysis and the financial impact for us if we were to remain in a sustained flat rate interest environment. My job is now to provide you with a detailed view of that analysis. So let's turn to Slide 13.  To analyze the impact of this scenario, we looked at both what would happen to operating earnings as well as to certain areas of our balance sheet. First, the blue line shows the base interest case -- rate assumptions where the 10-year starts at roughly 3% and then if you follow that blue line, increases to 4.5% by 2013. Then we illustrate the flat rate scenario with the a yellow line, where the 10-year yield drops to 2% and then it stays there over the time period. The operating earnings difference in 2012 as a result of this scenario is $0.21. In 2013, the total impact will be $0.42. It's a coincidence that it happens to be an additional $0.21. Now it's important to understand that this is the incremental impact. MetLife's earnings would be growing in the base case. Another way to show this on the next slide.  So let me explain this chart on Slide 14 to you. In 2011, we assumed MetLife will earn approximately $5 billion in operating earnings. That includes both the domestic and international businesses. We've assumed for purposes of this illustration that MetLife's earnings would grow at 8% per year. That's 6% growth domestically and about 10% growth in international for a blended rate of 8%. So in 2016, earnings would have grown to about $7.5 billion. However, in the flat rate scenario, we project that we would have about $500 million of spread compression in our U.S. business by 2016. I'll give you more details about that in a minute. We would also have a decline in operating earnings of roughly $700 million, primarily from 2 other factors.  First, we estimate our pension cost would increase another $50 million after-tax, and there would also be a $600 million decline in investment income from the assets held in our surplus account, which shows up in corporate and other. The remaining $50 million is made up primarily of international as U.S.-related assets. Therefore, the total incremental decline in operating earnings in 2016 would be approximately $1.2 billion. Remember, in the base case, we said earnings would grow to approximately $7.5 billion, so that in the stress case, they will only grow to $6.3 billion. That represents about a 4% implied annual growth rate over the 5-year period. I think that's worth repeating. Our earnings will grow at about 4% annually, not decline, as the market seems to expect.  Now let's look at the components of spread compression for U.S. business in 2016, and as shown on Slide 15. The bars show the compression in earnings relative to the base case interest rate environment for each business segment by 2016. It is important to note that the benefit from our interest rate hedges is also in these numbers. Steve Goulart will give more detail about our interest rate hedging program in a moment. The biggest impact is in Retirement Products or our Annuity business at $200 million in 2016. Almost all of the impact here is in our deferred annuities, where much of the in-force block has a 3% minimum guarantee. We assume that customers will maintain their funds and their contracts with the 3% minimum and we will therefore experience spread compression as we reinvest assets and lower interest rates. Partially offsetting this compression is the fact that we will lower crediting rates on that part of our block where we are not at minimum crediting rates today. We will also receive income from our hedging contracts.  The story is similar in Individual Life. Lower reinvestment income partially offset by dividend cuts in our traditional products and crediting rate reductions in our UL products as well as higher hedging income. There's also a DAC true up caused by lowering dividends here. While universal life has interest rate risk, only 35% of the block is at minimum crediting rates and we have a very effective ALM strategy. Therefore, much of the potential impact in this scenario is muted. In Group Life, while these products, in general, have significant repricing flexibility, the impact is in the Total Control Account or TCA. In the flat rate scenario, all of our TCA balances are already at their crediting rate minimums, but we do have substantial hedging activity here to partially offset the decline in reinvestment income.  In Non-Medical Health, only a small amount of the impact comes from long-term care, which might surprise some of you. Our long-term care block, which is now closed to new business is very well immunized against changes in interest rates. Most of the impact here comes from our disability business, where lower reinvestment income cannot be offset by a reduction in liability crediting rates, although we do have some hedging income here as well.  The small impact of $40 million in Corporate Benefit Funding is probably the most surprising number on this slide. Despite the long duration of these products, the cash flows here are very predictable and we have very tight cash flow matching in the segment, as well as several deferred starting derivative contracts to help. Again, Steve Goulart will give you some more detail about that in a minute. Finally, as you would expect, the impact on Auto & Home is very small.  So we've discussed how low interest rates can affect normal operating earnings. Now we turn to the potential impact on our balance sheet on Slide 16. We conduct a number of examinations, at least annually and sometimes more often to determine the adequacy of our statutory reserves, our GAAP reserves, the level of our deferred acquisition costs and whether or not our goodwill should be impaired. Each one of these analyses is influenced by where interest rates are at a moment and what our interest rate outlook is for the future.  So starting with the statutory reserve cash flow testing, we are required by New York State to analyze every major block of business in the U.S. annually. Other states generally allow cash flow testing to be done on a more consolidated basis. We take the current policy liabilities in the specific assets backing those liabilities and project that to net cash flow for virtually in the entire life of the liabilities, and that could be as long as 75 years. We do these cash flow projections under 7 different interest rates scenarios, which are called the New York 7. And we do a similar type of analysis for GAAP reserve cash flow testing as well. With regard to DAC or deferred acquisition costs, we amortize DAC over the life of the in-force policy generally in sync with when the profits emerge from the in-force block. We review the assumptions about the ultimate profitability of this block of business, and that would include our claims experience, our lapse rates, the expenses of servicing the block, the performance of the stock market if it's a product like a variable annuity; and of course, the impact of interest rates. We don't change these assumptions very often because the liabilities are generally very long. So even if current experience is different from our DAC assumptions, we usually assume that over the life of the product, the results will revert back to the norm. But we do occasionally change these assumptions, that's called a DAC unlocking, and it will cause us to change our DAC balance and that might be positive or negative, by the way. I give you this background because in this low interest rate scenario, we assumed that we will start lowering our interest-rate assumptions in our DAC calculations beginning in 2014. I don't believe it would happen any earlier than that. If we believe that interest rates were going to improve after 5 years, I don't think we would change any of our long-term interest rate assumptions. But in this scenario, we don't assume an improvement and I think it's important we show how big the DAC write off might be if we don't assume any future improvements.  Finally, when we acquire a business, goodwill is usually created in the purchase accounting process and then is allocated to the appropriate business line. In the last financial crisis, we came very close to impairing the goodwill in our Retirement Products business because both the stock market and the interest rates had declined materially and significantly affected the profitability of the business. Many of our peers did write off some or all of their goodwill in the annuities businesses during that period. No other business at MetLife is even close to a goodwill impairment. But in this scenario, the stock market performance is better, but interest rates are even lower, so there is a chance we would have some good -- level of goodwill impairment likely sooner rather than later.  Now let's look at Slide 17, which shows the results of our balance sheet analysis. So in our low interest rate scenario, what were the results? I'm sure you'll be glad to know that we have very healthy statutory insurance reserves. And while we don't think we will be required to strengthen reserves even at these interest rate levels, we may have some modest strengthening. Our GAAP reserves are also very strong, and we expect no GAAP loss recognition under this scenario.  With regard to DAC, we have assumed we will have negative unlockings in 2014, '15 and '16 in our Annuities and Universal Life product areas. The cumulative impact of these unlockings is estimated at $425 million after-tax, with most of that occurring in 2016. Also, we believe that in this scenario, we would impair some, or all of the $1.7 billion in our Retirement Products segment. If we impaired it all, that would be about $1.2 billion after-tax. To put the DAC and goodwill write-offs in context, we currently have $61 billion of GAAP stockholders' equity and these charges would represent a little more than one quarter's earnings for us. In other words, they would not materially change MetLife's financial position. So I think the bottom line of this study we have undertaken is that if the current low interest rate environment lasted for the next 5 years, it would have an impact on our financial performance, but it definitely would not weaken the company or put us in a perilous financial position.  Now I'd like to pass the presentation over to Steve Goulart to discuss how our investment actions have positioned us to help mitigate some of the financial impact of a low interest rate environment. Steve?
Steven J. Goulart: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 19. I'm going to talk a lot about our asset liability management in this section. It's the critical underpinning to this analysis. And most importantly, it's the asset liability management you've practiced in the past that matters most, because what you can do today is not that meaningful. There really aren't any magic levers to pull at this point. If you practiced sound asset liability management, you're going to be in reasonably protected shape. And at Met, we've always practiced sound consistent and disciplined asset liability management.  Our investment management structure and practices include not only investment professionals but also associates from finance and the business lines as well. Portfolios are managed according to underlying guidelines as well as ongoing input from ALM committees and regular relative value and asset allocation reviews. And importantly, while we pay attention to total returns, we're essentially liability-driven investors. That is, we invest according to the needs our liabilities create while seeking optimal returns in liquidity. As a result, our portfolios are highly matched from a cash flow perspective and I'll show you some examples shortly. Additionally, Steve showed you the steadiness and dependability of our net margins over the last 10 years. This is a reflection of our disciplined ALM practices. That is also what led us to add low interest rate protection starting in 2004, long before anyone started talking about it. And I'll discuss that further in a few minutes, too.  We've continued to expand our capabilities as we have grown. Our commercial and agricultural mortgage lending and real estate platform is the best in the industry, and we have the track record to prove it. Over the last 10 years, we've originated over $74 billion of commercial mortgages. And in that time period, our total credit losses are well less than 1/2 of 1%. Our ability to originate assets like these and private placements continues to be strong in this environment. They provide significant additional net investment income compared to public securities and government bonds. Given the focus on ALM, on asset allocation and risk management, we actively review and manage our portfolios to ensure we will continue to meet the needs of the liabilities and our policyholders, as well as and most importantly, generate attractive returns to our shareholders. Starting on Slide 20, let's take a closer look at 3 product investment portfolios that have traditionally been thought of as having significant reinvestment risks: Corporate Benefit Funding, deferred annuities and long-term care. As a result of our consistent ALM practices, we have modest reinvestment risk in all 3. First is Corporate Benefit Funding, specifically our long-term portion, which consist of U.S. and U.K. pension closeouts, structured settlements and other benefit funding products. It is a fairly large portfolio consisting of $45 billion in invested assets. On the right bar, you can see total expected investable cash flow for 2012 of $2.9 billion. However, as indicated in green, $2.6 billion of this represents new sales, which are priced in current markets, so there's no reinvestment risk for the bulk of the cash flows. The small red slice of $300 million represent net cash flow from the portfolio to be reinvested. This includes net investment income roll-offs and maturities, net of outflows to customers. This relationship continues very steadily into the future. 2013 is actually even better than this, so you can see the true reinvestment risk in Corporate Benefit Funding is minimal. On Slide 21, we look at deferred annuities, part of our Retirement Products segment. Assets are nearly $25 billion. On the right, you see investable cash flow totals $2.7 billion. $600 million of this total represents new sales, which again are sold at current market rates so have minimal reinvestment risk. But there are 2 other categories to show you. First, the orange slice represents our estimate of how much existing customers will deposit at their guaranteed rates, which would represent reinvestment risk to us. However, it is worth noting that we also have $10 billion of interest rate floors in this portfolio protecting us against rate guarantees. The red slice is $1 billion of net cash flows from the portfolio, again representing inflows from the portfolio net of outflows to customers. These 2 slices account for nearly all of the $200 million in spread compression over 5 years, that Bill Wheeler showed you in Retirement Products earlier.  The final portfolio that I want to show you is long-term care on Slide 22. Long-term care is a fairly small portfolio at $6.8 billion. As you know, we stop selling long-term care, so there are no new sales. However, we still receive renewal premiums on the block. You can see here we expect investable cash flows of $900 million in 2012, representing those renewal premiums and portfolio cash flows. Nearly 1/2 of the $900 million or about $400 million is already hedged on a longer-term basis to provide us with interest rate protection. And again, this relationship continues into the future. I hope this has helped further impress upon you the importance of asset liability management at MetLife. We are very disciplined and consistent and it has served us well.  Now let's turn to Slide 23. I mentioned earlier one of the previous outgrowths of our diversified ALM, existing low rate protection. In 2004, we started adding interest rate floors. They're very cheap at the time, and we thought they added prudent protection against the low interest rate environment. I don't think many people were concerning themselves with this kind of an environment at the time, but we were. We added over $47 billion notional amounts through interest rate floors, swaps and swaptions over the ensuing years. In 2012, this protection would provide nearly $500 million in pretax income. Almost as important, you should note that this protection extends beyond 2020 and well into the next decade. Further, it is with a large and diversified group of counterparties. And consistent with our practices, we continue to look at different scenarios and what they mean to us. As an example, we have been modestly adding protection against rising rate scenarios. On to Slide 24. As we look forward, there's more to do. We will continue broadening the asset mix and diversity of our international portfolios, which is part of our strategy upon closing Alico. We do this regardless of interest rates, but it will further bolster our net investment income. I mentioned commercial mortgages earlier. We've been able to continue expanding here, as well as in agricultural lending, real estate equity and private placements without taking undue risk due in large part to current market conditions and opportunities and our strong franchises in these areas. Of course, we'll continue to analyze ways of protecting the portfolio through derivative and other ALM strategies. But most of all, we will continue to adhere to the disciplined ALM and risk management practices the way we've always done. Now before I turn it over to Bill Mullaney, I want to quickly review another topic with you, our European investment exposure. There are 3 slides in the appendix starting on Slide 32, which summarize this. MetLife's total European exposure is approximately $42 billion in GAAP book value, which is less than 10% of our general account portfolio. It's important to note that the market value exceeds the GAAP book value by more than $1 billion. Generally speaking, our European exposures focused on those higher-rated countries in the region. The largest holdings are our $24 billion of non-financial corporate bonds. These holdings are in companies that are market leaders in the utility, telecom or infrastructure sectors or large investment grade companies that are globally diversified such as food and beverage, energy or pharmaceuticals. I would highlight that over 90% of our European portfolio is investment-grade, and of the 10% which is below investment grade, approximately 60% of it is in the corporate sector. Less than 2% or about $8.8 billion of our portfolio is invested in European financials. This is an area where MetLife has been reducing exposure for nearly 2 years. Within financials, our European hybrid exposure is less than $1.4 billion or less than 0.35% of our total portfolio. Our hybrid positions are concentrated in financial companies in the U.K., Netherlands and Switzerland. As you can see from the slide, we hold approximately $6.9 billion in European banks. We've sold nearly $3.5 billion in book value since early 2010 at average prices in the mid-'90s. Sales have focused on institutions with exposure to peripheral Europe, lower preference capital structure instruments and larger absolute exposures, particularly where we had any credit concerns. Our remaining holdings are generally in the larger, better-capitalized European banks. Turning to our peripheral sovereign exposure. When we purchased Alico a year ago, we initially acquired $1.8 billion of GAAP book value exposure, of which approximately $726 million or 40% was Greece. Since then, we've sold approximately $1.1 billion in book value of peripheral sovereigns. Our remaining book value exposure to the peripheral sovereigns is now $571 million, of which $377 million is Greece.  Slide 34 provides the key takeaways relating to our European exposure. But let me just say in summary, we've managed our exposures to the most sensitive credits very well and according to plan. We knew Alico had exposures that we would need to proactively manage. We've managed them down materially and we will continue to do so. Given the size and diversification of our total portfolio, we do not feel that our remaining European exposures pose a material risk, and we deem our level of exposure to be very manageable going forward. With that, let me now introduce Bill Mullaney.
William J. Mullaney: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. In addition to the actions that we're taking on the investment portfolio, there are also actions being taken in the business to address the interest rate risk environment. As you would expect, the most impactful action we can take is to increase prices where we can on existing business. The most common way this is done is for products with shorter liabilities that renew periodically. An example of this is our group insurance businesses. This business renews annually, subject to rate guarantees. So we have the opportunity to adjust prices to reflect the current environment. Auto & Home is another business that renews annually where we have the ability to change prices. So as you saw in the earlier slide, these businesses are not particularly interest rate sensitive. We also have some longer liability businesses in which the contract permits us to increase prices. As we have discussed in the past, we've been raising prices on our in-force long-term care business to improve returns.  On Slide 26, here are some additional actions that we're taking and some of the actions that we can take in the future in dealing with low interest rates. For longer liability businesses where we can change prices, here is some actions we can take: In our variable annuity business, for example, one of the actions we are pursuing is adding some of the new funds that we have in our new VA product to our in-force business. These funds are managed to reduce volatility but also reduce interest rate exposure by virtue of the interest rate swaps that are in the protected growth strategies funds. As a result, these products require less capital. Getting these funds adopted in existing business in a meaningful way could increase returns by reducing our capital requirements. It will also decrease the amount of hedging that we need to do since some of the hedges are embedded in the funds. If low interest rates persist, we're also looking at implementing an increase in fees when a VA policyholder elects to step up the contract to the higher income base. We have more flexibility on business we write going forward as we can adjust prices to reflect the current environment. In the past, we've talked about how we measure returns on new business. As interest rates have come down over the last couple of years, we continue to adjust prices to reflect the low interest rate environment. More interest rate-sensitive products such as Universal Life, structured settlements, pension closeouts and Group Disability have all seen increases in prices, in some cases, multiple price increases to reflect our expected returns on the assets investment, and we will continue to do this. Another action we've taken is to reduce the minimum interest rate guarantees we have embedded in our products. Before the year 2000, it was not uncommon for many products to have minimum interest rate guarantees of 3%. Over the last decade, we've been reducing these minimum guarantees. The total control account is a great example of this. The 3% minimum guaranteed rate was reduced to 1.5% in April 2003, and reduced again to 0.5% in April 2009. We're also considering whether to reduce the minimum further to reflect the current environment, and we are taking similar steps with our other products. And finally we can put greater emphasis on selling less interest rate-sensitive products, either through pricing actions, adjusting compensation to agents or placing some limits on more interest rate-sensitive offerings. And not on the slide here, but obviously, we also have the option to reduce expenses and our businesses as we look to maintain returns in the low interest rate environment. With that, let me turn it back over to Steve Kandarian.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thank you, Bill. Let me wrap up by summarizing the key takeaways from today's call, starting on Slide 28. Overall, even if interest rates remained at historically low levels for another 5 years, MetLife's earnings will continue to grow, the impact in our balance sheet would be modest, no stat reserve strengthening will be required and most importantly , we will continue to generate excess capital. We also possess a number of tools that management can and would use to respond to protracted low rates.  To conclude on Slide 29, I believe MetLife is less of a play on a 10-year treasury and more of a play on the growing middle class around the world, which is eagerly seeking financial protection and retirement security. It is our diversification that will provide us with strong and growing earnings. Even under a scenario of prolonged low interest rates, the U.S. business would hold steady while the International business would provide continued earnings growth. This is yet another testament to our commitment to managing MetLife for the long term. We saw the financial downturn coming long before others and took a number of steps that might have seemed overly cautious at the time. Now with our recent acquisition of Alico and the actions we have taken in our U.S. business, we are well positioned to weather a prolonged period of low interest rates. If rates returned to more normal levels, the amount of value we create for our shareholders will only accelerate. With that, I will turn the call back to John McCallion.
John McCallion: Thanks, Steve, and again, we'd like to apologize for the technical difficulties we had. This will be available for replay. Again, the dial-in number is the same as was in the press release at (320) 365-3844. And obviously, we in Investor Relations will be available for your questions as well. We're going to extend the call for 10 minutes for Q&A. I understand we're backing up against some other calls here, but for those that can stay on, we'll make ourselves available for another 10 minutes. So let me turn it back over to Greg for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne Agee.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I have one going back to the third quarter and then one for this one, if I could. When you guys characterized excess capital, in the prior call, you mentioned $3 billion at the holding company at year end after you paid the common dividend and the $750 million debt maturity. And I believe that was above your $1 billion consistent cushion. My question for you is this, hypothetically speaking, if you weren't a bank holding company and subject to the stress testing, is it your view that the entire $3 billion is fully deployable?
William J. Wheeler: Yes.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: And then the last question I have for you is just -- is there a certain type of insurance business that if you were looking at it, let's say, from an M&A perspective, in this type of 5-year 2%, 10-year treasury yield type of environment that you would be extremely concerned about its ability to pass the statutory cash flow testing, or New York 7 test? And if so, which types of business would sort of be on the top of your list of concerns?
William J. Wheeler: No. I'm not going to go there. No. You got your job, John.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: All right. If I could just follow up then with a different one. The pension cost, the incremental $50 million over the next several years, that surprised me as low. I guess the question for you is why?
William J. Wheeler: You're right. It is low. But remember that's the 2016 number. It actually -- it's interesting, the impact is later in the 2016 time frame as assumptions get modified and smoothed. It's a bigger impact in the early years and that's factored into that $0.21.
John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. Understood. So that's just the incremental $50 million from 2015 to 2016?
William J. Wheeler: No. Actually it's from now until then. But it starts -- if it's a $50 million impact then, it's a bigger number now and then as the impact gets smoothed over time. But in the $0.21 number for 2012, we include the full '12 impact of the pension.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher from Credit Suisse.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes, I just had a quick one from the earlier call as well, then an interest rate one. I just want to confirm, I know for 2012 you're going to need Fed approval for your capital management. Assuming the bank sale goes through, I just want to confirm that your understanding is you will no longer need Fed approval post the sale of that bank in terms of capital management?
Steven A. Kandarian: Tom, that's correct. If the bank gets sold and we're no longer a bank holding company. The Fed would not be approving our capital management. Obviously, it's a little time before we get that bank sold, we're doing everything we can to move that along as fast as possible, but there are number of regulatory approvals that are necessary to go through. So I can't tell you exactly the timing is going to be. We're hoping by the end of the second quarter of 2012, that we'd no longer be a bank holding company. Tom, I should probably add that we're going to resubmit here in January and are looking forward to hearing back from the Fed sometime before the end of March. So you can figure out that timing in terms of bank holding company.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. So your timing back from the SCAP [ph] would be potentially March. The potential close of the sale of the bank end of 2Q. So for the 2012 plan, it sounds like it would be Fed approval, but then beyond that, the hope would be no longer, assuming the sale of the bank goes through. Is that the right way to think about it?
Steven A. Kandarian: Yes. So most likely, we'll be receiving a response from the Fed before we're no longer a bank holding company.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. That's what I thought. And then on the interest rate side, on Slide 15, when you get into the $540 million of spread compression by product, are you allocating any hedge offsets? And can you just give us an idea on how you're allocating the hedge gains as a partial offset? Is it done pro rata or -- that's my first question on interest rates.
William J. Wheeler: Yes. The hedging offsets, and that was in my remarks, are in these numbers. And it's not pro rata or anything like that. The derivative, the specific derivatives contracts, which are both swaps and floors as well as swaptions are allocated to different portfolio and of course, it's the match the risk and the liability shape and things like that. So that's how it's allocated.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And Bill, what's the aggregate hedge gain in 2016 again that are -- these are net numbers obviously, but what is the absolute hedge gain that's being assumed here for 2016?
William J. Wheeler: I think the way to look at that is look at the chart. Let's just go to that page quickly. Whatever it is, got to dig down there. I think it's on Page 23. And you can kind of see that. If you assume the orange line, which is the middle, in 2016 you can see that the numbers crudely $600 million pretax derivative income from all these contracts.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: That's pretax and these are after-tax numbers, that $540 million?
William J. Wheeler: That's right.
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Got it. And then the last question I had is, when you do this interest rate assumption, are you assuming any level of sort of stressed prepayment activity from your portfolio, meaning some convexity prepays on mortgage backs or bond calls or are you not making much of an assumption there?
Steven J. Goulart: It's Steve Goulart. Yes we are. I mean, again, we're reflecting how we think the investment portfolio would performed given this [Audio Gap] [Technical Difficulty]
Thomas G. Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Mortgage-backed prepays?
John McCallion: Tom, it's John. We'll address the that off-line. We're going to have to just keep moving here.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Sanford Bernstein.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'm going to stick with the pattern of one earnings call and then one interest rate question. On the capital issue, and I hear what you're saying about applying for approval and all that, but let's just assume that for whatever reason regulatory-wise or political-wise, you don't get to redeploy the capital that you'd like to. My question is what is Plan B? Because you're going to be building a ton of capital. You mentioned the dividends coming out of the international subs in January, so you're going to be sitting on a lot of this capital. So what is Plan B? What are the alternatives in terms of what you can do with that? And then I'll have an interest rate question?
Steven A. Kandarian: Let me start by saying our expectation is our plan will be approved next year. So that's our starting point. So you're saying what if it's not approved? We will continue generating excess capital. We will look for ways to deploy it. We hope to no longer be a bank holding company by midyear. So we will -- things will unfold on that basis.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So just as a follow-up, I mean if you wanted to do something with that capital in terms of M&A or what have you, would you need approval for that as well or is it just the capital return to shareholders?
Steven A. Kandarian: We'll look at M&A in the normal course. Obviously, we look at it in the context of how accretive is it compared to a share buyback. Right now, as you know, we can't do the share buyback, but our assumption is, we will be able to do share buybacks in the first part of next year. So we will continue looking at M&A opportunities. We inform the Fed about our activities, but we don't seek approval from them.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. Terrific. And then just on the interest rate presentation. Thanks, by the way, that's very helpful. But you mentioned those stat reserve impact or the GAAP impact is pretty small in terms of reserves 5 years out, but -- not this is likely, but what happens if we extend the time frame beyond 2016. I guess at what point does it become a bigger problem in terms of stat reserves or GAAP reserves? Is there a cliff some time beyond 2016 or how should we think about that?
William J. Wheeler: No. There's no cliff. Remember, the way stat works, we're actually projecting the cash flows to the life of the liability and then present valuing it back. So we're not thinking that somehow magically in, like 2017 that answer will change. And the GAAP analysis works the same way. So there wouldn't be a cliff kind of impact there.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And then quick question for Steve Goulart. In your plan what is the new money rate assumption that you're using in this 5-year outlook?
Steven J. Goulart: Based on -- essentially what we're seeing currently which is just under 4%.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.
Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So in the investment portfolio, can you provide some details as to how you're changing your asset mix given the current environment? I'm guessing traditional corporate looks somewhat less attractive there. What are the key areas that you're looking at increasing your allocation of your investments? And perhaps you can also provide some details internationally as to how you're broadening your asset mix there as well?
Steven J. Goulart: Nigel, it's Steve. Some of this is -- also what I commented on in the low rate scenario, too. What we're seeing today is really still great opportunities in private asset originations and commercial mortgages and agricultural mortgages. So we have been over the course of the year, increasing our allocations of those sectors. And as we look forward to next year, we're likely to see that relationship continue. At the same time we continue to check from a relative value basis how it compares versus other opportunities and traditional corporate bonds and the like. But we really like what we see in private assets.
John McCallion: Well, thank you, everyone. Again, we will post the replay information on our Investor Relations portion of the website. And that's going to end the call. Thanks for joining.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws, including statements related to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the conference call over to John McCallion, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John McCallion: Thank you, Ernie. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of this non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplements, both of which are available at MetLife.com. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Wheeler, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management, including: Bill Toppeta, President of International business; Bill Mullaney, President of U.S. Business; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer, Bill Moore, President of Auto & Home; and Donna DeMaio, President of MetLife Bank. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Kandarian: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to announce that MetLife had a strong second quarter. We grew earnings per share by 13% over the prior year quarter demonstrating the ability of MetLife's diverse portfolio of businesses to create value for shareholders. Overall, operating earnings grew by 45% to $1.3 billion and we generated record premiums fees and other revenues of $11.8 billion, a 38% increase. What is notable is that we achieved these results despite losses of $218 million related to the natural disasters in the United States and Japan. As you know, I became President and CEO of MetLife on May 1. Over the last 90 days, I'm engaged with many of MetLife's senior leaders to gather their views on the company's strengths, areas for improvements and opportunities for growth. These meetings have reaffirmed my belief that MetLife can achieve its vision of being the leading life insurance employee benefits provider in the world. We have also sharpen my focus on some initial high-level priorities to help drive value for our customers and shareholders. The first is the successful integration of Alico to ensure we capture the full value of this acquisition both on the short term and the long term. Essential to this process is optimizing our portfolio of countries and businesses to ensure the best strategic fit. Since the beginning of the year, Bill Toppeta and his team have sold our businesses in Venezuela and Taiwan and a portion of our business in the U.K. and Japan. The specifics reasons vary from political uncertainty to asset liability mismatches to integration costs. But the common thread is that we did not believe these businesses would be able to meet the return thresholds we have set for the company. These divestitures will free up roughly $1 billion of capital that can be redeployed to deliver better value for shareholders. At the same time, we have also been pursuing strategic acquisitions. During the second quarter we signed an agreement with Dexia, to purchase its Turkish Life Insurance business and enter into an exclusive 15-year distribution arrangement. While we expect this transaction to improve our market position from 12th to fifth in Turkey, a high-growth market with favorable demographics and an attractive macroeconomic department. In addition, we announced this week that MetLife has entered into a 10-year exclusive distribution arrangement with Punjab National Bank of India, to sell MetLife products to its branch network. PNB, the second-largest bank in India gives MetLife access to 60 million customers from more than 5,000 branches. This move will provide MetLife with the opportunity to move into the top tier of insurance companies in India. Another sign that the integration is succeeding is a strong international sales we experienced in the second quarter. Total international sales for MetLife Alico were 25% higher than they were for the company's on a combined basis in the second quarter of 2010. In Japan, while sales fell 7% short of plan as a result of the earthquake, it was still up 28% over the prior year. In addition, the Alico integration remains on track and we expect to meet all of our targets. The second priority for MetLife is to strengthen our ability to achieve profitable growth and value creation. When we get the formula right, the results are impressive. Under Bill Mullaney's leadership, we saw U.S. annuity sales in the quarter rise to $7.3 billion, a 48% increase, which helped drive operating earnings in the Retirement Products business to $201 million, up from $136 million in the second quarter of 2010. Part of this growth was driven by our new GMIB Max offering, a simpler retirement income solutions that significantly reduces our hedging costs and we believe will provide customers with more consistent returns over time. Given our goal of a balanced growth, we are making adjustments to the product that will reduce our risk and improve returns. We anticipate completing our filing with the SEC in August. Another area of strong performance is in U.S. Business insurance products, where we grew earnings by 22% in the quarter on a strong underwriting results and higher net investment income. We believe our strategy of maintaining discipline in underwriting and pricing is the right one and it's starting to pay off. In addition, we're encouraged that more rational pricing seems to be returning to the group life and disability markets, particularly for larger cases.  A third priority I want to highlight this morning is our drive to be a world-class company in every aspect of our business from talent in technology to brand and culture. Our goal is to create a high-performance organization marked by clear decision-making and innovative thinking and results focused culture. I will have much more to say about this at our Investor Day conference in December. For now, let me cite one example. Earlier this month, we launched a program with GM to provide 1 year of car insurance with every new vehicle purchase. If this highly innovative pilot if successful, we believe a broader program could drive significant growth in our Auto & Home business. Of course, what won't change to MetLife is our commitment to financial strength and risk management. For example, faced with the threat of low interest rates pressuring earnings, we have not sit by idly. As we told you at our last Investor Day conference, we began purchasing hedges against low interest rates in 2004. I'm not sure how many in the industry can say they have hedged their interest rate risk as successfully as we have, which we think is a good example of the forward thinking we do here at MetLife. Even if the 10-year Treasury drops below 2.5% and stays there for several years, we have in place significant protection.  Just as important, we are taking steps to ensure we remain on a level regulatory playing field with our competitors. As we announced last week, we are exploring the sale of a Depository business of MetLife Bank while holding on to our Mortgage businesses. We do not believe it is appropriate for the overwhelming majority of our business to be governed by regulations written for banking institutions. In the highly competitive global insurance marketplace, it's imperative that we be able to operate under the same regulatory framework as other insurance companies. Even if we are designated as systemically important financial institution, it will be as an insurance company not as a bank. Which brings me to the topic I know you are eager for MetLife to address, excess capital. As we've said before, our long-term ROE target of 13% to 15% by 2015 assume some level of capital redeployment. What I want to re-emphasize is that we will manage our excess capital with the same level of discipline that we apply to other parts of our business. Bill Wheeler will have more to say about this in a few minutes. In closing, let me say how excited I am to be leading MetLife during this time of tremendous change and opportunity. I believe MetLife is well positioned to provide exceptional value to our 90 million customers and profitable growth to our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler to go through our second quarter results in greater detail.
William Wheeler: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.3 billion or $1.24 per share for the second quarter, which, when added to our first quarter earnings, results in an annualized ROE of 11.8% for the first 6 months of this year. There were some unusual items in this quarter. First, pretax variable investment income was $425 million, after taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $46 million or $0.04 per share above the top of our investor day guidance. This was driven by strong securities lending, private equity returns and higher prepayment fees. Also as Steve mentioned, the record catastrophe activity in the United States during the second quarter resulted in a $174 million of losses in our Auto & Home business, which was $137 million or $0.13 per share after tax above plan. Lastly, as you may recall, our Japan operations is reported on a one-month lag and therefore, the impact of the earthquake in Japan that occurred on March 11, affects our second quarter results. We recorded $44 million or $0.04 per share, after tax, in additional insurance claims and increased operating expenses. Excluding the impact of these unusual items, normalized operating earnings were $1.37 per share this quarter, generating a normalized, annualized ROE of 12.1% for the first 6 months of the year, a strong result. Now let's take a look at the results in the quarter by line of business. U.S. Business reported operating earnings of $908 million for the second quarter, up 12% from the prior year quarter of $813 million. Excluding the results in Auto & Home, U.S. Business operating earnings were up over 30% year-over-year due to strong profit growth in Insurance Products, Retirement Products and Corporate Benefit Funding. Insurance Products' strong performance was driven by a significant increase in Group Insurance underwriting margins and continued improvement in investment margins. The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was an excellent 82.1% as compared to 86.6% in the prior year quarter and well below our 2011 guidance range of 88% to 93%. This results represent Group Life's best-ever mortality quarter. While we are naturally very pleased with this performance, we do not believe this ratio is sustainable for the remainder of 2011. The Non-Medical Health total benefits ratio for the quarter was 87.5%, which was down from the prior year quarter of 87.8% and well within our 2011 guidance of 86% to 90%. In Dental, better claims activity, combined with our pricing strategy, resulted in favorable underwriting. Our disability results continue to improve due to lower claims incidents but we saw lower recoveries in the quarter. Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was a solid 84.4%. This quarter's results was higher than the exceptionally strong prior year quarter of 80.4% due to higher average claim size and lower reinsurance recoveries but still a good result. Turning to our Auto & Home business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes was 121.5% for the second quarter, which was up over the prior year quarter's results of 95.3% due to unusually heavy storm activity. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, was 85.7% in the second quarter versus 85.5% in the prior year period. A non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve release, of $17 million after tax, was taken in the quarter compared to a $12 million after tax release in the prior year period. Retirement Products operating earnings were up nearly 50% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong separate account fee growth due to higher net flows and favorable investment performance. Corporate Benefit Funding operating earnings were up 34% year-over-year, driven by higher net investment income coming from both variable and recurring income.  Turning to the top line performance for U.S. Business. U.S. Business reported premium fees and other revenues of $7.6 billion for the second quarter, up 6% as compared to the prior year quarter. The primary drivers for this increase were from Retirement Products, which increased by 15% from higher separate account fees due to positive net flows and favorable separate account investment returns and Corporate Benefit Funding, which increased 53% due to higher pension closeout sales which fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter and strong structured settlement sales. Insurance Products revenue was essentially flat year-over-year, reflecting the challenging macro environment and our ongoing commitment to disciplined growth. Auto & Home revenue was up 3% year-over-year. Now let's move to International business. International reported operating earnings in the second quarter of $507 million, up from $142 million in the prior year quarter largely due to the acquisition of Alico and growth in the business. To give you a better sense of International's overall growth, for the quarter, International's revenues were $4 billion. This was approximately 11% higher than the second quarter of 2010 on a combined basis as if we had owned Alico in both periods. In Japan, the year-over-year increase in revenues on a combined basis was approximately 12%, driven largely by the favorable exchange rate of the yen versus the U.S. dollar and higher persistency. On a constant rate basis, revenues were up 1%. While sales in Japan were below plan this quarter due to the crisis, they were up 28% year-over-year on a constant rate basis. Sales increased in all product and distribution channels with the strongest gains coming from the bank and direct marketing channels. In the other international regions, the year-over-year increase in revenues on a combined basis was approximately 9%, strong revenue growth in Latin America and favorable exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar were the main drivers of this growth. On a constant rate basis, revenues were up 3% while sales were up 23% year-over-year, a very strong result. Moving to expenses, our operating expense ratio for the quarter was 23% and 20.4% when excluding the impact of MetLife Bank and Pension and Post-Retirement Benefits. Both ratios are below our 2011 guidance range of 23.5% to 24.1% and 21.2% to 21.7%, respectively, overall a good result. Turning to our investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in fixed maturity and equity securities were $11 billion, up from $6.7 billion last quarter. Please keep in mind that interest rate driven unrealized gains and losses in our investment portfolio are generally offset by changes in the economic value of our liabilities. With regard to realized investment gains and losses, in the second quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net losses of $38 million, which include impairments of $77 million after tax. With regard to derivatives, we had an after-tax gains of $189 million, driven primarily by lower interest rates. Our Commercial Mortgage holdings continue to perform better than expected. As of June 30, our valuation allowance is $469 million, down from $532 million at March 31. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 64% from 65%, as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, our delinquency rate was only 40 basis points, the majority of which we do not expect to incur any loss. Lastly, I would like to update you on our exposure to sovereign debt in peripheral Europe. As I'm sure you are all well aware, there've been significant recent developments around the Greek sovereign debt including the announcement of a broad outline of a new financing package. These recent events had no impact to our second quarter GAAP earnings, as our expected recoveries exceed our GAAP book value.  Now I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings for our domestic insurance companies for the second quarter of 2011 were quite good at approximately $820 million and our preliminary statutory net income was approximately $715 million. For this first 6 months of 2011, statutory operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. This is a good result and in line with our full-year expectations. In addition, our international capital position is strong with Alico Japan's reported first quarter current solvency margin ratio of 1,463% and new solvency margin ratio of 868%. The new solvency margin ratio measure does not become an official reporting metric until the first quarter of 2012. We are managing to a 600% target ratio on this new basis, which implies excess capital of $1.5 billion. Cash and liquid assets at the holding company at June 30, were approximately $3.4 billion. Adding dividends, we expect to receive from our domestic and international operations, less $1 billion of cushion at the holding company, we will have approximately $4.8 billion of excess capital at the holding company available for capital management activities in the fourth quarter of 2011.  I would define holding company capital management activities to include the annual common dividend, stock buybacks, debt management and M&A activity. Regarding debt management activity, keep in mind as we have previously discussed at investor day, our intention is to repay $750 million of debt maturing in December of this year. In addition, while I will not provide you full details of 2012 at this time, there are some incremental dividends for the holding companies that we expect next year. We recently announced the sale of a portion of our U.K. business. This freed up approximately $500 million of capital that we will have access to upon closing of the sale, which we expect to happen in 2012. Also, we expect to complete the conversion of Japan from a branch to a subsidiary by the middle of 2012 and therefore, would expect to dividend a minimum of $700 million from Japan to the holding company at that time. Therefore, we will have approximately $1.2 billion of additional dividends to the holding company that we would expect next year above our normal dividend generation for 2012. We spend a lot of time evaluating what investments should be made in our existing businesses, and we view getting cash to the holding company as an important step toward excess capital deployment. Overall, we expect to have nearly $5 billion of deployable capital at the holding company by the fourth quarter of 2011, and we expect to generate significant cash to the holding company in 2012 as well, all of which can be used for the capital management activities that I just discussed. With regards to timing, we are engaged in discussions with the Federal Reserve and our board regarding our capital management plans, subsequent to these discussions, which should conclude with our October board meeting, we would expect to provide further details on our capital management activities. Overall, our capital position remains quite strong. As Steve mentioned, we remain committed to prudent capital management to create value for our shareholders. In summary, MetLife had a very good second quarter in spite of the tragic events in Japan and the extraordinarily bad weather in the U.S. this quarter. This quarter reflects the strong underlying fundamentals of our core businesses and our focus on expanding margins through disciplined growth, underwriting and expense management. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John Hall with Wells Fargo Securities.
John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Steve, I have a question around the bank holding company and the like, is there a sense of timing around when that might be fully executed and is it possible for the regulatory authorities to just say no?
Steven Kandarian: John, the timing that we anticipate is second quarter 2012, and a sale would have to be approved by the Fed. But obviously we'll be very mindful of that as we think of the [indiscernible] this business.
John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: So to the extent that capital deployment were to occur before Q2 2012, then the Fed has to be clearly on board?
William Wheeler: Yes, as we have said in a couple of times in many places all our capital management activities towards the end of this year will need Federal approval.
John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And then just around the International business, you've been very active around this optimization program, I was wondering, after this flurry of activities, is there more to come?
Steven Kandarian: John, we look at our overall portfolio from a strategic point of view and we're constantly assessing the different businesses that we've owned for a while ourself as MetLife and also we picked up in the Alico transaction. So there's ongoing discussions and analysis around those topics. I don't want to announce anything right now. We don't have anything to say at this moment. But I can simply say that we are constantly assessing our businesses across the entire portfolio both internationally and domestically.
John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Is the guiding principle, it sort of seems so far get big or get out, is that a fair way to look at things?
Steven Kandarian: I think size isn't the only measure here. Size can be a factor. It depends on the marketplace but profitability is really the key. Return on equity, delivering shareholder value is what we're really focused on.
John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And then just finally real quick, how do the losses out of the Auto & Home business this quarter relate to whatever your 1 in a 100 P&L might be?
Steven Kandarian: Let me turn it over to Bill Moore.
William Moore: John, it's Bill Moore. The losses in the second quarter were actually equivalent to 1 in 100 [indiscernible] for us at Auto & Home. Obviously, when we make those determinations it's based on one event as opposed to the 12 events that were in the quarter but the actual dollar amounts were about exactly the same.
John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And how much -- was there any reinsurance coverage on these losses?
William Moore: No.
Operator: We have our next question from the line of Andrew Kligerman with UBS.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: Bill, real quickly, I missed the end of that comment about the timing of the Federal government discussions where you could redeploy capital, when are you going to finish that up?
William Wheeler: The discussion with the Federal Reserve and our board, which we think will conclude -- we'll have something more to say after the October board meeting, which is at the end of October.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: And then in hearing your comments about the revenue in Japan on a constant currency basis of 1%, same-store, other international, 3% revenue growth same-store, I'm wondering when you get done with the integration and we're, let's say 2, 3 years out, would you expect earnings to track with those revenues? What kind of earnings outlook can we expect 2, 3, 4 years from now in the long term?
William Toppeta: Andrew, it's Bill Toppeta. First of all, I would tie this more to sales. Sales are strong overall. They're up 25%. In Japan, they're up 28% year-over-year. So I think what our future outlook would be will be much more tied to our sales than to our revenues. I mean, the current softness in Japan I think is almost totally explained by the tsunami, the earthquake and the results of that and maybe adding a little softness on top of that for Europe. Those things are more macro related, and I think that they will be remedied in the course of time. But making a prediction, 3 or 4 or 5 years out on earnings, I think it would be perilous, at best.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: I guess, Bill, just thinking about these revenue numbers I mean because you had the strong sales, I mean, I'm just wondering if you're doing 25% sales growth 4 years from now, can you achieve double-digit earnings? That's where I'm kind of disconnected because the sales were good this quarter and the revenues same-store were not. So just quick answer. I don't know, can you direct me where I'm missing something?
William Toppeta: You're kind of breaking up a little bit, so I'm losing little bits of your question. I don't want to...
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: Yes, I mean just the bottom line, sales were robust and your revenues were not. So what might give me that confidence down the road that you could still do double-digit earnings out or even higher revenue growth down the road?
William Toppeta: Well, I mean, I don't know if I can add much to what I just said. I think the products are priced correctly. The margins are in the products and the sales are coming in very strongly.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. And with that terrific sales growth about 25% combining Japan and other countries. What were some of the strong products that you saw out of Japan and some other products at other countries that drove these sales?
William Toppeta: Well, I think there are a couple of things. One is, I think, A&H sales are very strong and they're not just strong in Japan, where they continue to lead. I mean the A&H sales in Japan are up 10% but we told you at our Japan Investor Day that we had, before the Alico transaction even closed, that we were going to take A&H across to other markets and we are doing that successfully. A&H sales are up strongly in Latin America, in places like Chile and Argentina, in Mexico, their A&H sales are good and I think we'll get stronger in Korea. I think places like the Middle East and China are also showing strength in A&H and these are very good margin products. So I think that should add to your confidence. The other thing that I would say is it's not quite a product, but I think one of the stories that will evolve here over the next several quarters is Bancassurance. I mean our Bancassurance business is very strong with the major bank distributors like Citigroup growing strongly, the mega banks in Japan, overall, the Bancassurance sales, second quarter, are up 81% year-over-year and that's not even putting in things like what Steve mentioned about Turkey and the acquisition there the new deal in India. So I would say keep an eye on Bancassurance sales going forward because this is a very strong area for us.
John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Great then just one last one for Bill Wheeler. So it looks like ING sold its Latin American business to another player. So the question is in terms of M&A, is there a lot of activity going on? Are you seeing a lot of potential deals out there? Are you interested in acquiring in Brazil, for example, what are you seeing in terms of M&A activity in the near term?
William Wheeler: I would guess I'd answer that by saying there is a lot of activity and there's a lot of activity on the international front, not a lot of it is smaller. Sort of like our deal in Turkey but there's a lot of activity. In terms of our interest, look as I think we've said many times, in many places, we want to focus on growth businesses, with good ROEs, the cash that we use for this business, we have to make sure that we get a good return on and that we can build shareholder value and compare that return to other uses for that capital, and I think that our track record there is pretty good. And so there's a lot going on and we'll continue to look at it.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. So I think the Turkish deal off the top of my head was about $250 million deal. So that was the kind of activity if something were to happen that I should be focused on?
William Wheeler: I think that would be typical.
Operator: We do have our next question from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: A question for Steve. Steve, as you look out at the potential for U.S. downgrade, I was hoping you could just give us your views on what you think that the ramifications might be under that scenario and how you and the management team are preparing for such an outcome? Is there anything you're doing differently over the past few months with this risk rising, whether in terms of portfolio shifts or hedging activities or otherwise?
Steven Kandarian: John, yes, we have been obviously quite focused on this and let me just say that, maybe at a higher level first, that while this is a very difficult time, is following this very critical issue closely, I'll just mention that it's beyond just reason of debt ceiling that's going on in Washington right now. It's really a bit of a turning point for us as a nation in terms of getting our finances in order long term. So as painful as it is to watch this, it is kind of democracy at work, and the hope is that not just we raise the debt ceiling in an appropriate way but that we'll be addressing these long-term issues for our economy so that we remain a strong currency, a strong environment for economic growth in the future, and I am hopeful. It's hard to watch. It's difficult to see it everyday, but I am hopeful that there will be action in Washington that will be appropriate, that'll address this long-term problems in a sensible way. And we have been working very hard at this internally. I'm going to turn it over a minute over to Steve Goulart to give you some specifics but let me just say in a high level that we feel that we are well positioned even if there happens to be a 1 notch downgrade of the U.S. Treasury at this point in time. And I'm not saying that will happen, but we have to, at least, take that into consideration as a contingency.
Steven Goulart: Thanks, Steve. Certainly if you look at what's going on in the market, there's a fair amount of stress that's starting to build up. Nothing at catastrophic levels yet but we're clearly are seeing it on a daily and hourly basis, and look at different indicators like treasury bills, treasury bills have cheapened for August. They're actually trading in at bigger discounts than September bills at this point. And we've seen haircuts increase on RMBS on treasuries on many asset classes and then probably most importantly, everybody's building cash, look at the money market fund outflows, I think they have reached record levels. And it's a period of uncertainty, and what most people do is really try and liquefy those markets. As Steve indicated, we've looked hard at the implications of a U.S. government treasury downgrade, and with any of the realm of possible downgrade, there really is no impact from a capital perspective on our investment portfolio. So we don't envision any big asset class shifts, although we continually review what's developing. We are doing a couple of things, though, on a near-term basis. First is we have insured that we've extended all of our near-term treasury maturities past August. We just don't want to be in that position of what uncertainty could develop regarding developments in Washington. And the second, like I mentioned before, is we have been building cash. We've added several billion dollars of excess cash, which we think is a prudent thing to do in an environment of uncertainty that exists today. And what it does is, there's a couple of things, certainly to the extent there are any market liquidity issues developing, I think we'll be well positioned for those. And secondly is to put a little bit of an opportunistic hat on as well, and to the extent that there are investment opportunities that become available, we want to be positioned to take advantage of them. So I think we're very well positioned at this point and obviously are staying on top of what's happening in the marketplace.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Just as follow up to that, 5 or more years ago, you guys started to buy hedges in a higher rate environment against the low or sustained low rate environment, I'm wondering if today you're looking out and perhaps buying protection against the potential, at least, for rapidly rising rates?
Steven Goulart: Well, we always have had a very thorough, very sound asset liability management strategy underlying all of our investment activity. We have been taking advantage in certain portfolios, in certain sectors, of buying interest rate caps where it makes sense and we'll continue to do that.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Okay. And then just a follow up on the capital and the timing issue, not to beat a dead horse, I assume this is going to receive some more attention, but October is only a few months away in the scheme of the long term, it's not that big of a deal, but your capital position, as Bill as you laid it out, it's frankly better than I think most on this conference call would have expected and your stocks are pretty cheap. I'm just wondering why no additional sort of urgency, perhaps, to get through this process. As many others who have had to go to the Fed and get approvals have already done so.
Steven Kandarian: John, it's Steve. Let me start and Bill can add other comments. We spoke to our board when we did this, our largest transaction our history, Alico, about how we would proceed for the coming year after the closing, November of last year. And one thing that we agreed with them on was let's make sure that this acquisition is fully integrated, that we get the results that we anticipated at the time that we struck this deal and before we start thinking about capital redeployment. So that was something that we agreed to with them and the timeframe that Bill Wheeler laid out in terms of late October board meeting relates to that.  The second thing I'd say is, over the last several months, we've seen a great deal of uncertainties still remain in the marketplace around regulatory issues. And it's unclear at this time how that will impact all of us in the industry. So we just think it's prudent to wait at this point in time, as much as we understand the desire by our shareholders and others, to get a clarity on this issue of capital redeployment. But still, we think it's prudent to wait along the lines we talked about with our board last year to make a determination late October about what the right strategy would be going forward.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Can I just follow up on that Steve, if we go back in time to that discussion and agreement with your board, as you think about where your capital position stands today versus where you expected it would stand at that time, is it fair to characterize, is it fair to say that even for management, capital is in a better position?
Steven Kandarian: We certainly feel very good about our capital position. We are hopeful about how things will sort out in Washington around regulation. We believe the integration of Alico will continue on track as we mentioned. So overall, we're quite optimistic.
Operator: We have our next question from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley: So you mentioned with International that you expect to hit all of your targets. Now at the beginning of the year, you've provided guidance for that division and at least based on our calculations in using quarter results, you need about a 9% pick up in average sales in the back half of the year to hit the midpoint. So my question is whether the midpoint is still achievable and if they were, what are the factors driving the sort of expected improvement in the back half of the year, or are we now looking at the lower end of the provided guidance? And if so, what changed relative to your assumptions at the beginning of the year?
William Toppeta: Nigel, it's Bill Toppeta. You were breaking up a little. So if I get the question wrong, you'll correct me. But in terms of the guidance that we gave back on Investor Day, we still believe that we will be in the ranges that we gave you at that time. So there's no change with respect to any of those targets. The one thing I might add because I know that some people kind of take every number and divide it by 4, that's not exactly the way we do our plan. So there is some seasonality in our plans with respect to, particularly earnings, they do tend to be more back-end loaded. So they usually start off slower in the first and second quarters, and then pick up in the third and fourth. That is consistent with this year, so, but we believe we will be in the ranges that we gave you.
Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And did you see, also a question on International, yen clearly you're depreciated, so any update with regards to currency hedging plans for 2012?
William Toppeta: I'm going to pass that to Mr. Wheeler.
William Wheeler: Well, just a review of the bidding. We did talk about we put on a hedge to protect some of our earnings really we bought a floor. That obviously, that floor, exchange rate has moved away from that floor. And so we're along ways away from that target. I think today, the yen is JPY 77, JPY 78 to the dollar. We do examine occasionally to be opportunistic with regard to hedging currency. It is not our policy, by the way, to hedge currency on an ongoing basis. But when we think there's a great opportunity at a great price, we do it. So we haven't done anything since then but we do continue to look at it.
Operator: We have our next question from the line of Colin Devine with Citigroup.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: Just fairly quick things, first with respect to the favorable group life mortality, was the benefit from that of a $0.03 a share and if so, isn't that what we should really be taking that out of the quarterly run rate? I would assume you expect that's going to reverse in future quarters. And second, and I really I think I'll direct this to Steve, the VA sales, I think, set an all-time industry record for the quarter for a single company, how comfortable are you at this sort of $7 billion-plus or are there some future revisions that might be coming that sort of take sales down a bit? And then lastly for Bill Wheeler, at the back changes coming under GAAP, what impact does that have for your business, thinking both with respect to how you run your core agencies here in the U.S. but also internationally, where you do, you have some big agent forces and you maybe forced to expense more immediately now than [indiscernible]?
William Mullaney: Colin, it's Bill Mullaney. Let me start on the mortality question. Yes, we had an excellent quarter as it relates to Group Life Mortality. As Bill said in his remarks, it was the best quarter we ever had. Our second quarter tends to be a better quarter for us seasonally, historically. I think in terms of thinking about the Group Life Mortality going forward, obviously, we don't think it will stay at 82%. Like I said quite a good quarter but I would think more towards the low end of the range for the balance of the year. We gave a range at Investor Day of 88% to 93% and I think modeling toward the lower end of the range is probably the best way to think about it.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: So is about $0.03 the right number?
William Mullaney: Yes, roughly, I'd say that's right.
Steven Kandarian: Colin, It's Steve on the VA issue. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have a filing-in to the SEC on some proposed changes. So let me just kind of state a general level to the question that like all of our products, all of our businesses, we look for a balanced growth. We have a real broad portfolio of products, of markets we're in globally. And one of the reasons we performed so well this quarter in the face of significant headwinds, headwinds related to natural disasters, related to issues in the economy in Europe and the United States and elsewhere, is that we have a very balanced portfolio. So we're very mindful of that, it's part of our strategy, it's something we focus on all the time. So we wouldn't want any one part of our business to overwhelm other parts of the business. So we're mindful of that, we meet as a team regularly on these kinds of issues. As I mentioned, we do have a filing with the SEC, which we anticipate we'll sort through in August and we'll have some adjustments to the features on the VAs. And I'll just add that when we put out GMIB Max, we have to make a call about what would be competitive in the marketplace. We thought it was a very attractive product for our customers. We thought it also help reduce our risk at MetLife, it was kind of a win-win in our judgment, and I think that has proved out in the marketplace. The features we put in place really dated back to the December timeframe in terms of the market conditions. December to August is a great deal of time in terms of changes that's going on, and we re-assess these things all the time. So you'd expect and you'll see that we'll be making some adjustments in the VA space soon.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: I should assume that you love the VA space but you're not in love with it, I think as somebody used to tell us?
Steven Kandarian: Yes, I think that's right. That's a good way to think about it. You know, Colin, the one thing I would say is it is a very dynamic marketplace in the VA space right now. You're seeing a couple of things happen. First of all, the market itself is growing dramatically. If you look at the first quarter growth year-over-year, it was up over 20%. Secondly, there's been a great concentration of VA sales among the top 5 players. And today, VA sales for the top 5 were over 50% of total sales, where a few years ago it was in the low 30s. And so, the level of sales that you have in any given quarter is a function obviously of the product that you have in the market, but it's also a function of what happens in the competitive environment and we want to build products to make sure that we can react quickly to changes in the marketplace so that we continue to grow this business at a rate that we like. It's an important part of our growth story and we're committed to it. But as Steve said, we just want to manage it well in the context of our overall portfolio of businesses.
William Wheeler: Colin, and finally, it's Bill Wheeler about the back changes. So obviously DAC policy is going to change regarding what kind of a marketing and sales expenses can be capitalized next year and that's true for both Domestic, International businesses obviously. We're also going to likely, though it's not a given, we're likely to do a retrospective adjustment regarding our current DAC balance and make that conform with sort of the new accounting policies to provide sort of consistency between years and that may very well result in a one-time write-off in fact sometime in the early part of next year. Non-cash charge, obviously the change to book value. And I think some people have focused on the idea that well, gee, if the agent is an employee of a company versus to be [ph] the third party that may change your DAC policy and what can be capitalized and unfortunately, even though that may end up being through. My philosophy, and I think the philosophy of Met is we don't let accounting peculiarities drive business decisions, okay. If it's good to have agents as MetLife employees and have them sell in that way and pay them as such, accounting should not be the decision about whether or not or certainly whether an expense that's capitalized, or cost gets capitalized, or expense should not be driving that decision. It should be business driven. That said, there's likely to be some anomalies at least in the short run. In the long run, I think this all is not much of an issue. But in the short run, the next year or so, there might be some anomalies on how people's income statements work. Our peculiar issue happens in Japan or really with regard to Alico where our DAC in purchase accounting, our DAC is replaced with VOBA and which works a lot like DAC but is not able to be adjusted for changes in DAC policy going forward or certainly not in the same way that our DAC balances are. So that could cause some anomalies in some of our earnings for our International operations as well. So there's lots of little wrinkles. We're not in any position yet to kind of size these issues and in a quarter or so, we might be able to, obviously, by Investor Day, we think we'll be able to. But so it's, I guess, stay tuned.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: Just to follow up on that, it shouldn't impact your capital management decisions since, of course, there's no DAC on a statutory basis, is that fair to say?
William Wheeler: That's right. So there's no DAC on the statutory basis. It's not a cash charge. It will affect GAAP book value.
Operator: And next will go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Crédit Suisse.
Thomas Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG: First one on capital management, Bill, earlier in the year, I think the comments that you all have made suggested buyback plan that you announced at the end of this year will probably be something less than $2 billion, and it sounded also like when you're evaluating different opportunities, buyback seems to be taking a bit of a backseat to dividends. Is that still true? Can you shed any light on updated thoughts related to sort of the balance between the 2?
William Wheeler: Probably not. I guess I feel that -- look, I think we're committed to doing both. And when we talk to investors and we say what's important to you, dividends or buybacks? Guess what? We get both answers. To some investors groups they really focus on dividends, others want to see buyback activity and our expectations that we'll do both, and we'll try to do both in a balance that make sense. In my mind, it's just too early to speculate about size of deals, size of programs. And I'm not sure we'll tell the world or we'll give a program target size. I'm not sure that's how we should manage buyback activity. I think we should be opportunistic and obviously it depends on stock prices. And so there's a lot of variables. I'm not sure I can shed much more light on it.
Thomas Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay, fair enough. I also just want to come back to the international question about revenue growth. Sort of how sales growth eventually turns into revenue growth. As we think about Met's International business, I think as it was laid out after the Alico deals was announced, this is sort of a high single-digit revenue grower if I remember correctly. So low single digit in aggregate for International seems certainly a bit on the low side. If your sales targets that you put out there and the level that you saw this quarter continue, are we going to see a pretty quick catch-up of revenues in '12 and '13? So is it still kind of a high single digit in aggregate revenue growth business and is there just a bit of an anomaly here based on sort of how sales will progress or can you help us think about that and how that would progress?
William Toppeta: Yes, it's Bill Toppeta, Tom. I would say the answer is absolutely yes. You're talking about a business that will grow high single digits. I mean the one thing that as I reflected on the question that was asked before and now on yours, I think the one thing where we might be seeing a bit of an anomaly is in the area of persistency. So our persistency is improving generally but not improving as quickly as we would like it too. So I'll give you the example of Japan. Persistency in Japan is up a little less than 1% for the quarter. We had a persistency program to roll out in Japan, which was to address a couple of things. One would be orphaned policyholder and the management of orphaned policyholders and the other one was notifications to agents in an earlier and more timely way, so that they could work on the retention of the business. Those things, those programs were all delayed by about, and I would say, 45 days as a result of the earthquake. So there may be something in the persistency area that has a bearing on this but I still think the conclusion is that this is a high single-digit growth business in terms of revenues and I think you clearly will see that going forward. The other area where I think there is a little softness as I've said before is Europe and I think those 2 things are the explanation. They are, I think, a bit of an anomaly. I hope that helps.
Thomas Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG: It does, yes. That explains it. And then just one last question if I could, the one thing that does stand out about Met's results is the Group results are certainly holding up better than most peers, can you comment on what's going on behind the scenes there, is it pricing, is it the results you're seeing on the claims side or just better, where do you think you're at? And if peers are struggling a bit, do you think the market may, is it showing any signs of hardening, too?
William Mullaney: Yes, Tom, it's Bill Mullaney. Let me give you some perspective on the Group market overall. The results that you're seeing, I think, are clearly reflective of the disciplined approach that we've taken to managing this business over the last several years. And I've talked about on earlier calls and at an Investor Day about the aggressive pricing that we've seen in the Group market. You've seen our Group market top line results slow as a result of our unwillingness to chase the market on price. And I think what you're really seeing now is that the earnings power of this business is really coming through because we've been very disciplined about how we price and our claim results have been very, very strong. I think a great example of that is the Disability business. We hear some of our peers are struggling in that business and what I will tell you that the results -- the claim results of that business continue to be affected by macroeconomic trends, higher incidence rates, lower recovery rates. We were very early to recognize that and began pricing that into our business as early as 2009 and certainly through 2010. And so our loss ratios have held up pretty well during that because of the fact that we increased our denominator because we raised our prices. But we paid the price for that in terms of growth in that business. What we're starting to see is we're starting to see the market harden. If we look at deals that we're quoting on for 2012, which tend to be in the large case market, the pricing seems to be a little bit more rational and we seem to be getting our share of deals at prices that we're happy with. So we think the market is starting to move in our favor and I think you're going to see the Group business grow again, both top and bottom line, at more historical rates.
Operator: And our final question will be coming from the line of Suneet Kamath with Sanford Bernstein.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Thanks for the additional color on the capital position and your thoughts going forward. I think that's very helpful. I did have just a couple of quick follow-up questions on that topic. The first, as you think about the $5 billion of cash at the holding company that you could redeploy, I guess I just wasn't taking notes fast enough, did you mention what sort of implied RBC that would leave your U.S. Life subs at?
William Wheeler: I didn't. But to give you a sense of it, our combined RBC ratio at the end of 2010 was 458% and my expectation is that, that will decline by the end of 2011. And I'm not quite sure we have an internal projection where that will go to but it will head south because we don't need that much capital at the insurance subs and as I sort of said in my remarks, the excess capital that's sitting on our insurance sub, it doesn't really become deployable until it gets to the holding company and that's our expectation is what we're doing this year and we're bringing a lot of that capital up to the holding company so it then can be used for other things.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Second follow up is just on the math, you had mentioned a couple of uses of that capital, I think, debt repayment and then the common stock dividend and then obviously anything you want to do in terms of M&A, just so I have the numbers, you said $750 million of debt repayment and then whatever you guys decide the common stock dividend will be this year, is there anything else that we should think about other than the M&A and obviously the buyback?
William Wheeler: No.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then the last question is just on the dividend philosophy, you mentioned you kind of listened to investors in terms of what they want. Would you consider moving to more of a quarterly common stock dividend and on the path there was some reluctance because of the additional costs given your large shareholder base, but I think they're somewhat nominal. So that's something that you'd consider if investors were interested in that type of payment frequency?
William Wheeler: I guess the short answer is maybe. When we set this policy over 10 years ago, the cash or the additional expense was kind of made it prohibitive in our minds. I think things have changed. And the costs are not as significant as they once were. So it's something that we will likely examine. Other people have kind of given this feedback, too, that maybe a quarterly dividend makes more sense and so it's something we'll think about.
John McCallion: Thank you, everyone.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.  With that, I would like to turn the call over to John McCallion, Head of Investor Relations.
John McCallion: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplements, both of which are available at metlife.com. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.  Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, Chairman of the Board; Steve Kandarian, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Toppeta, President of International Business; and Bill Wheeler, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management, including Bill Mullaney, President of U.S. Business; Bill Moore, President of Auto & Home; and Donna DeMaio, President of MetLife Bank.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
C. Henrikson: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As you will hear in a moment, MetLife delivered very strong results in the first quarter as we remain committed to the fundamentals of the business. As you know, the Board of Directors has elected Steve Kandarian as President and Chief Executive Officer effective May 1 this week. Over the coming months, Steve and I will continue to work very closely together ensuring a smooth transition of responsibilities, with Steve dedicating his time to running the business. I have great confidence in his ability to lead MetLife into a new era of global growth and outstanding performance.  I will remain Chairman of the Board through the end of the year and will continue to focus on various functions within the organization. Since the beginning of the year, I have visited our Japan operations in February, China in March and the Middle East offices in April, hearing from the local management teams about their businesses. It is clear the leadership teams and employees are extremely talented and committed to a successful integration of Alico. I will continue to visit our worldwide locations, gathering input and feedback on the integration process.  We are very pleased with the process we've made and the direction we are heading as the leading global life insurance company. This morning, Bill Toppeta will provide an update on the impacts to MetLife of the recent tragic events in Japan. However, let me just say we are humbled by the humanitarian actions of our own associates in the region and inspired to see the MetLife family come together in Japan and around the world to support each other. It is a true demonstration of one MetLife.  Now Steve will take you through the highlights of the first quarter.
Steven Kandarian: Good morning, everyone. As I begin my new role as MetLife's President and CEO, I am honored to have the opportunity to lead this great company. I have the good fortune of succeeding Rob Henrikson, who has been a great leader and has created a solid growth platform on which we will continue to build. We are operating from a position of strength and have many opportunities to extend our lead in the marketplace. Thank you, Rob.  Now let's get started on our results. The first quarter of 2011 was a very good quarter for MetLife. Our businesses are performing well as we continue our commitment to disciplined growth and expense management. We had record top line performance with premiums, fees and other revenues increasing to $11 billion, up 27% over the prior year and 15% sequentially. Operating earnings grew to $1.4 billion, up 64% over the prior year and 17% sequentially. And our book value per share increased 10% over the prior year, primarily due to strong operating earnings in investment results.  In addition, our investment portfolio provided solid results for the quarter. As we disclosed on Monday, the board of directors has appointed Steve Goulart as our new Chief Investment Officer. I'm confident that under his leadership, the investment department will continue to provide value for our shareholders through solid returns and security for our policyholders through a strong balance sheet.  While Bill Wheeler will provide you the details of our results, I'd like to share some highlights. In U.S. Business, premiums, fees and other revenues were $7 billion, down from the prior year and the prior quarter, primarily due to lower pension closeout sales and the impact of continued high unemployment, as well as a challenging pricing environment for the group insurance businesses.  Operating earnings were up 15% over the prior year period. While the lack of growth in the U.S., marketplace is frustrating, I am very pleased with our margins, which are a direct result of our disciplined pricing and our focus on risk management.  Within our Insurance Products segment, while Group Life operating earnings were essentially flat year-over-year, underwriting results were strong. In Non-Medical Health, operating earnings increased over 50% from both the prior year and the prior quarter, mainly due to improving underwriting results in dental and group disability. While incidence remains elevated, recoveries continue to improve in group disability.  In Retirement products, robust separate account fee growth driven by higher net flows and favorable market performance resulted in a 13% increase in premiums, fees and other revenues over the prior year. Total annuity sales were $6.1 billion with record-setting variable annuity sales of $5.7 billion. Operating earnings were $212 million, up 5% year-over-year.  On Monday, we launched the new GMIB Max variable annuity rider. We believe this offering is a win-win for consumers and MetLife. These solutions provide our customers better protection against extreme market swings while providing the opportunity for growth, leading to more guaranteed income over time. From MetLife's perspective, there is a significant reduction in the hedging costs of this new rider, and we expect more consistent returns over the long run.  Turning to International. First quarter premiums, fees and other revenues were $3.8 billion, up from $1.1 billion, largely due to the acquisition of Alico. Overall sales were up 27% based on the comparison of combined first quarter 2010 MetLife and Alico results, as we witnessed continued recovery in key markets and channels.  First quarter sales in Japan were up 45%, with all product lines and channels showing year-over-year growth, including significant increases in the bancassurance and direct marketing channels. Japan had operating earnings of $290 million, in line with plan. Bill Toppeta will provide a more detailed update on the tragic events in Japan. I want to express my condolences to the people of Japan and my gratitude to my colleagues on the ground, who are working through this difficult situation.  Sales in other international regions were up 21%. This increase was primarily due to solid performance in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. Growth in Latin America was driven by institutional business in Mexico, the Group Life and dental business in Brazil and in accident and health insurance in both Chile and Argentina. Growth in Asia Pacific was driven by life insurance sales to the agency channel in Korea.  Operating earnings were $277 million and in line with plan due to growth, favorable underwriting and lower expenses. Overall, U.S. business performed well, particularly, in light of the economic conditions in the United States. We are committed to remaining disciplined in our growth and maintaining strong margins and returns. As to International business, results were solid and in line with expectations. And we are making good progress on the integration of Alico.  I'm especially pleased to see the strong recovery in Alico-related sales in precedency [ph], particularly in Japan. As most of you know, we are working hard on the integration of Alico into MetLife. However, let me assure you that we remain focused on all of our operations. Backed by a solid financial position, strong brand and momentum in the marketplace, we have the opportunity to create an even stronger, more profitable and more valuable MetLife.  With that, let me turn it over to Bill Toppeta to provide an update on recent events in Japan.
William Toppeta: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would also express our sorrow about the recent tragic events in Japan and our admiration for the strength and resilience of the Japanese people in general and of our Japan colleagues in particular. Overall, the situation in Japan is challenging but appears to be improving, and it remains fluid. Our operations have responded well to the challenges and have begun to return to normal operations.  We've taken many steps to aid and relief efforts. Our Japan business provided direct support to impacted employees, agents and their families. We have made various charitable contributions and have been helping our customers in the regions hit by the earthquake and tsunami. I'm happy to report that none of our employees or career agents has been killed or seriously injured. Sadly, however, 2 of our independent agents are missing and presumed dead.  Under the circumstances, we decided that certain actions were appropriate. For the March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami, we have waived the earthquake and tsunami exclusions in our accidental death riders. In the affected regions, we have extended the grace period for premium payments and have reduced interest rates for new policy loans while at the same time expediting the process for claims, surrenders and policy loans.  From the onset of this crisis, we have been operating our business continuity program with over 300 of our associates temporarily reassigned from Tokyo to our facilities in Kobe, Osaka and Nagasaki. We currently expect to keep the business continuity program operating through September and thus through the peak power demand months of the summer.  With respect to the financial implications of the disaster, as you know, we report our MetLife Alico operations on a one-month lag basis. And thus, since the loss events occurred in March, we won't begin to reflect the financial impact until the second quarter. I would, however, like to give you our current best estimate of what that impact will be.  Our projections are based on the assumption that the situation in Japan, including the nuclear issue, gets no worse than it currently is and gradually improves. On that basis, we estimate that our policyholders represent about 4% of the population in the affected regions. We further estimate that the impact to the company's second quarter 2011 earnings from extraordinary claims and additional expenses due to the March 11 earthquake will be between $45 million and $65 million after taxes.  Most of the claims are on life insurance policies with a portion arising on accidental death and hospital coverage riders and policies as well, while the largest expense drivers relate to our business continuity program.  From a balance sheet perspective, our asset portfolio is holding up well. The only noteworthy investment we are monitoring is our bond holdings in Tokyo Electric Power Company, otherwise known as TEPCO, where our total exposure is presently approximately $550 million of book value.  Finally, our team continues to work diligently to keep our integration efforts on track. Of course, we've had to divert and reallocate some resources, but thanks to the exceptional efforts of many people, particularly our colleagues in Japan, we're confident that we can still meet our overall integration targets. Although, our subsidiarization project may take longer than we previously expected.  So I hope this gives you a brief summary of the situation. And with that, let me turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.
William Wheeler: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported $1.33 of operating earnings per share for the first quarter. As noted in the press release, our first quarter results reflect 3 months of Alico operations from December 1, 2010 through February 28, 2011. This morning, I'll walk through our financial results and point out some highlights, as well as some unusual items, which occurred during the first quarter.  Let's begin with premiums, fees and other revenues. Total premiums, fees and other revenues, which were $11 billion in the first quarter, were up 27% from the first quarter of last year and up 15% over the fourth quarter of 2010. This growth is due to having a full quarter's results from Alico, which we acquired in November of last year.  To give you a better sense of International's overall growth for the quarter, our International revenues were $3.8 billion. This is approximately 10% higher than the first quarter of 2010 on a combined basis as if we had owned Alico in both periods.  In Japan, the year-over-year pro forma increase in revenues was approximately 14%. This was driven by a 45% increase in sales, which increased in all product and distribution channels with the strongest gains coming from the bank and direct marketing channels. Higher persistency and a favorable exchange rate also contributed to the growth.  In the other international regions, the year-over-year pro forma increase in revenues was approximately 7%. Strong revenue growth in Latin America and Korea as well as favorable exchange rates were the main drivers of this growth. Turning to the U.S. business, premiums, fees and other revenues of $7 billion were down 5% as compared to the prior year quarter. This includes a 2% decrease in insurance products revenue as growth in dental was offset by lower revenue in Group Life and disability. Individual Life revenue was essentially flat. This performance is consistent with our planned forecast.  Overall, group insurance revenue continues to be impacted by high unemployment and our unwillingness to chase business at below desired margins or returns. Also, revenue in Retirement products increased by 13% from higher separate account fees due to positive net flows and favorable separate account investment returns.  And revenue in Corporate Benefit Funding was down significantly from the prior year quarter driven by lower pension closeout sales, which fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, and a decline in structured settlement premiums, which did have a very strong first quarter in 2010. Auto & Home's revenues were up 4% due to the growth across the business, and MetLife Bank's revenues were down 19%, reflecting lower mortgage refinancing activity in the quarter. Turning to our operating margins. Let's start with our underwriting results. In U.S. business, overall results were generally positive in the quarter with the exception of Individual Life. The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 88.2% as compared to 89.5% in the prior year quarter and at the low end of our 2011 guidance range of 88% to 93%. Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 92.5%. This is higher than planned and unfavorable compared to the prior year quarter. This quarter's results were negatively impacted by higher claims incidents in large face amount policies.  The Non-Medical Health total benefits ratio for the quarter was 87.7%, which was down from the prior year quarter of 91.2% and well within our 2011 guidance of 86% to 90%. In dental, our underwriting results continue to improve, demonstrating the better claims activity combined with our pricing strategy, is working quite well. Disability results also continued to improve as our disability loss ratio was significantly better than the prior year quarter and better than planned. We continue to see meaningful improvement in claims recovery experience in the quarter. While our incidence rates have remained elevated, they appear to have stabilized.  Turning to our Auto & Home business. The combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 98.5% for the quarter, which was up over the prior year's quarter's results of 94.1% due to poor weather, most of which did not show up in the catastrophe line. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 92.3% in the first quarter versus 88.8% in the prior year period. A non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve release of $10 million after tax was taken in the current quarter compared to a $5 million after-tax release in the prior year period.  Moving to investment spreads. The yield on our general account declined from 5% in the fourth quarter to 4.69% this quarter. The decline is due to the acquisition of Alico whose general account has a much lower yield. Without Alico, yields would have moved up sequentially. We saw continued strong investment spreads this quarter driven by both strong variable investment income results and solid core spreads. Pretax variable investment income for the quarter was $434 million, which is $109 million above the top of our 2011 plan range of $225 million to $325 million per quarter. Variable investment income after tax and deferred acquisition costs was $279 million, which is $61 million or $0.06 per share above the top of our 2011 quarterly plan range.  Moving to expenses. Our operating expense ratio for the quarter was 23.1% and 20.6% when excluding the impact of MetLife Bank and pension and post-retirement benefits. Both ratios are below our 2011 guidance range of 23.5% to 24.1% and 21.2% to 21.7%, respectively. This is a very good result.  Turning to our bottom line results. We earned $1.4 billion in operating earnings or $1.33 per share in the quarter. As we have noted, in an 8-K filed yesterday in conjunction with our press release, we have changed the definition of operating revenues to exclude variable annuity GMIB fees, and we've changed the definition of total operating expenses to exclude benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs. This change was made to better align the directional movement of the markets with the operating earnings in our quarterly results and is consistent with market practice.  This change in our accounting definition impacts our operating earnings and Retirement products. For the quarter, operating earnings and Retirement products would have been $34 billion lower, absent this change due to the 5% increase in the S&P 500 this quarter. However, this accounting change does not trigger a revision to our earnings guidance for this business because our plan assumes only 5% growth for the S&P 500 for the entire year.  With regard to investment gains and losses, in the first quarter, we had after-tax net investment portfolio losses of $29 million, which includes impairments of $59 million after-tax. With regard to derivatives, we had after-tax losses of $254 million driven primarily by higher interest rates and the weakening of the U.S. dollar against current -- certain key currencies.  Now turning to our investment portfolio. Gross unrealized gains in fixed maturity and equity securities were $13.5 billion, down from $14 billion last quarter. Gross unrealized losses of $6.8 billion were essentially unchanged from the last quarter. Overall, the fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $6.7 billion, down from $7.2 billion last quarter. Please keep in mind that interest rate driven unrealized gains and losses in our assets are generally offset by changes in the economic value of our liabilities.  Next, I'd like to briefly discuss our commercial mortgages. First, the loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 65% from 66% as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, our delinquency rate was actually 0, which is another key measure that demonstrates the overall strength of the commercial loan portfolio. Also, our commercial mortgage valuation allowance is $532 million as of March 31, down from $562 million at year end.  Finally, I'd like to provide you with an update of our exposure to peripheral Europe sovereign debt. You may recall at Investor Day, we reported that Alico had a statutory book value of $2.2 billion exposure to this region, and that portfolio had a market value of $1.9 billion. We also indicated that we would opportunistically manage down these holdings. At quarter end, our statutory book value for the region was $1.7 billion, and we have now moved to have subsequently reduced our position to $1.2 billion.  In this quarter, we sold approximately $400 million, resulting in a GAAP after-tax loss of $10 million, and we have impaired the remainder of the assets that we intended to sell resulting in a GAAP after-tax loss of $20 million. Overall, we have significantly reduced our exposure to peripheral Europe at modest cost since Investor Day.  Our cash and liquid assets at the holding company at quarter end were approximately $2.5 billion. Since quarter end, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company has repaid an intercompany surplus note and also paid a small dividend to the holding company. Cash and liquid assets at MetLife Inc. now stand at approximately $3.5 billion.  Our preliminary statutory operating earnings for our domestic insurance companies for the first quarter of 2011 were approximately $600 million, and our preliminary statutory net income was approximately $550 million. In addition, our international capital position is tracking in line with the analysis we provided at Investor Day. Overall, our capital position remains quite strong.  In summary, MetLife had a very good first quarter. Our investment performance continued to improve. Our operating margins remained strong, driven by disciplined underwriting and expense management, and our earnings continued to grow. Also, the strong performance of our International business, boosted by a full quarter of Alico's operating earnings, is quite encouraging. Although we are still in the early days, the benefits of this transaction are becoming a very apparent catalyst to drive MetLife's future growth.  And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Sanford Bernstein.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: I have 2 questions. The first one is on capital management for Bill Wheeler. I think I know the answer to the -- when will you start redeploying capital, which I'm guessing is the end of the year. But I wanted to drill down a little bit in terms of the why in terms of the timing. In some of the conversations I've had with investors have sort of suggested that maybe the way that we're thinking about excess capital in terms of risk-based capital might, if we looked at it under sort of bank regulatory capital requirements and some of the new Basel rules, your excess capital might be a little bit lower than what RBC would imply. And also, there's a risk of being named systemically important. So I just was hoping you could provide some color in terms of you're thinking about potential excess capital away from RBC and maybe under some of these other metrics.
William Wheeler: Sure, Suneet, so I think you're right. I mean, we've talked about -- in a lot of different public forums over the past period of time really, including Investor Day last December, we've talked about capital management as sort of being an end of 2011 exercise. And obviously, we pay an annual dividend, and we would declare that normally at the October board meeting. And you could say, "Gee, why this timing?" I feel that there's a couple of reasons for that. One is we wanted to make sure that Alico has gone as expected, and I would say so far it's gone very well. Secondly, we have to make sure we're in good sync with the rating agencies. And I think they have had a number of concerns over the past couple of years, and I think we've demonstrated that those concerns are unwarranted, but we felt that we would have to get into our 2011 year before some of those concerns went away. And those are really I think some of the big drivers. It is true that we are a bank holding company, and so we have to produce bank holding company capital ratios. Just to give you a sense of this, our Tier 1 bank holding company capital ratio is in excess of 8%. I think to be a well-capitalized bank, you need Tier 1 capital of approximately 6%. So obviously, there's a substantial capital cushion there as well. So I guess, I don't -- I'm not sure that's really a gating factor in terms of managing capital going forward.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Okay. But in terms of some of the newer Basel rules, do you have those updated?
William Wheeler: We don't, and it's not -- I don't think it's -- first of all, I think the Basel III capital ratios are unclear exactly what impact, if any, they will have on us. I believe we will probably not need to comply with Basel III in the way you might think. And obviously, the implementation of Basel III is more than half a decade off. So I don't think that's driving a difference between capital management, mid-year versus end of the year.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then on the SIFI, any comments there?
William Wheeler: We really don't. We don't know anything more than I think the general public in terms of where the FSOC will come out on SIFIs for the insurance industry. Obviously, we don't believe the life insurance industry should be considered systemically important, and we think there's a lot of good reasons why. But time will tell about where that decision gets made.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then my final question is just on your operating expense ratio. As you mentioned, it came in below plan. Away from what's going on in Japan in terms of the business continuity expenses, is there any thought to seeing a higher level of expenses in the balance of the year, investment in advertising or branding or anything like that? Or should we think that maybe you could come in below plan for the full year?
William Wheeler: There are some advertising initiatives scheduled in Japan, and there's a rebranding initiative. In fact, in much of the rest of the world, we had rebranding initiatives that have already occurred in the first quarter. Those special advertising or rebranding initiatives are really -- are reported as part of our integration cost, which means they're not included in operating income. They're below the line. And so that's what's going on with that kind of advertising. With regard to our overall expense ratio, I fully expect we're going to have a good year, and whether we'll be actually below our planned guidance or just at sort of the bottom end of it, I can't say yet. It's probably too early, but obviously we're off to a very good start.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.
Jamminder Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I had a question on Alico. I don't think -- I think you changed your disclosure in the supplement. But if you could maybe give some numbers around what the Alico earnings were or just talk about them. I think last quarter, the number was $114 million, and that was a little disappointing even though it was just one month. Then also related to that, if you could give some comments on what you've seen in terms of business activity at Alico in Japan in like the second half of March maybe and into April, whether you've seen some disruption related to the earthquake? And the final question just on variable investment income, it seems like private equity assets would have done very pretty well, maybe even hedged funds, but if you could talk about anything that would have changed. It seems like the results are poised to be relatively strong in the second quarter also as it relates to variable investment income.
William Toppeta: It's Bill Toppeta. I guess I'll start. In terms of Alico, I would say it is performing at the earnings plan. And we've melded in the operations, so we're not going to be reporting them separately. But its performance is quite strong, and I think if you look at the Alico plan that we had, we're just right on the button in terms of the earnings, and that's also true on the MetLife side as well. So we gave you the planned ranges back on Investor Day. I'd say we're on track for those planned ranges. In terms of the situation in Japan, sure, we've seen a slowdown in activity, certainly, during March. Remember, the second quarter there will be March, April and May. The event took place on March 11, so naturally, there was a suspension of direct marketing sales in Japan. There was also an impact, obviously, in the Tokyo area, which accounts for about 30% to 40% of the sales. So we have a pipeline effect here, which is that there's business in the pipeline, and so it's a little early to make any judgments about what the impact ultimately is going to be. But the 3 months that we're focused on now, obviously, will be March, April and May. I'd say the situation is pretty fluid, and I'd rather not speculate on it beyond that.
Jamminder Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Have you seen a stabilization or some improvement as the month has -- as we've gotten further away from it?
William Toppeta: Well, I think what we've seen is we've seen people coming back to activity. The question is what will be the result of that activity. So what we're seeing in terms of numbers is from pipeline effect, I believe, and so it's very hard to sort out what's going to happen going forward. I think you just have to wait for the result.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley.
Steven Goulart: Hold on. I think your last question was on variable income too. This is Steve Goulart, by the way. And the first thing I'd say is all components of variable income performed very well in the last quarter. You called out private equity funds and again, those performed very well. And remember there's also a lag, so what you saw in the first quarter really reflected the equity market performance in the fourth quarter, so that was very strong. And we -- to our outlook, obviously, the first quarter equity markets continued to be very strong as well, probably not quite as strong as the fourth quarter, but we would anticipate that strong performance to continue.
Operator: Nigel Dally [Morgan Stanley].
Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley: A question on banking, on the Banking segment, clearly, a more difficult quarter. I know you reduced your expectations from where you were at Investor Day. But based on the results this quarter, it seems like maybe even your lowered expectations may be tough to hit. So perhaps some color on the outlook for that division. Also, in the hopefully, remote possibility that having a bank means that you're going to be treated different from your peers with regards to required capital, is disposing the bank a possibility?
Donnalee DeMaio: This is Donna DeMaio. I'll take the first part of your question. The first quarter results for the bank are largely due to the overall decline in refinancing activity across the country. The mortgage market, which approached almost $2 trillion last year, is hovering around $1 trillion, $1.1 trillion depending on how you measure it for this year, largely due to refis, and we are no exception to that. So our refi balance -- our refis were down approximately 2/3 from the highs in 2010. Also, the first quarter is historically the lowest volume quarter due to seasonality, and we will expect that to pick up as the year continues.
William Wheeler: Nigel, with the second part of your question, in terms of the regulation of the insurance industry potentially by the Fed and because our -- mainly really for technical reasons, we're actually a bank holding company as opposed to a thrift holding company, which many of our peers are. I don’t -- it's not clear to me how that will all play out. Obviously, the substance of the issue is, is that we should be treated the same as the rest of the industry. We are mainly an insurance company, and we do have a nationally chartered bank, but we're an insurance company. And so the substance of the issue should be that the capital requirements and stuff should be the same as our peers, and it's a little early I think to speculate about how that will play out and how we'll negotiate with the Fed and others regarding those issues.
Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Very helpful.
Operator: We have a question from the line of Colin Devine with Citi.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: I have a couple of questions. First, with respect to the Auto & Home business, the volatility you've seen in cats and maybe over the last 4, 5 quarters, has that given you any cause to rethink how you're using reinsurance to manage the volatility on that? Second, Bill, you mentioned, I thought it was sort of a 5% assumed market increase in your GMIB pricing. Can you reconcile that for me with the guarantees on the product, which range from 5% up to 7%, in fact, I think 7.5%, and that's net of fees? And then third, it's my understanding that despite, obviously, an exceptional quarter in terms of sales gains for your VAs is ratcheting up the step-up guarantee on it now this month from 5% to 6%. Why on the back of such a strong quarter for sales does the company feel the need to ratchet up the future wars once again?
William Moore: Colin, this is Bill Moore. Just overall, our reinsurance position is really to utilize insurance to cover solvency-type events, and that's what we've built our models around. Our overall philosophy around how we handle a reinsurance cost or the catastrophes associated with that is through pricing. Our homeowner pricing projections for 2011 are in the 7% to 9% range, about 1/2 of that is for non-cat activity, about 4 points and about 4 points for cat activity. We are in the process now of evaluating our long-term cat projections and will be making appropriate pricing changes accordingly.
William Wheeler: And Colin, with regard to the riders and plan assumptions, we historically have always as part of our planned -- earnings planned projection process assumed 5% growth in the S&P 500. And I think we've acknowledged that, that's conservative. That isn't quite the same as how we model out the pricing, of course, in our variable annuity products where we assume over time obviously over the life of those products, we assume something more like an 8% or 9% return on the S&P 500, which of course is consistent with historical performance. And I think you know -- I'm sure you know this, that the roll-up rate in the rider isn't necessarily sort of the investment performance guarantee that we're -- or is only one factor in the guarantee that we're making. Obviously, as a GMIB company, equally or more important is the assumptions we make regarding interest rates and the annuitization rate when people can exercise that rider, and that obviously is a big factor into -- and annuitization rate is pretty low by the way. So that's a big factor in the underlying guarantee. So the performance of the equity markets is only a piece of it.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: Bill, if you can comment on the step-up, but also just to be fair, I think that with your comment on annuitization factor, it may be low, but your product does offer a 5% annual withdrawal benefit, your GMIB does, a dollar-for-dollar withdrawal. So I'm not sure it's, frankly, it's that conservative.
William Wheeler: Well, we probably reached how much we can discuss this in a public forum, but obviously, the withdrawal features in those products are modestly -- though they exist, they are modestly utilized, and that's obviously -- and a certain level of utilization is factored into pricing of the overall product as well.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: Maybe we can just go to why the guarantee is going to 6% from 5%?
William Mullaney: Sure, Colin. It's Bill Mullaney. Let me put VA sales in perspective for the quarter and why we decided to make the announcement of a new product in March. As you said, VA sales were strong in the quarter, $5.7 billion, which was a 40% increase year-over-year. We think that there's going to be pretty strong industry growth this quarter. It's early because we don't have the full numbers. But we expect the industry growth for VAs for the quarter to be, I would say, somewhere between 20% and 30%, so we will pick up some market share. I will tell you that the sales that we made in the quarter because of the level of interest rates and the product changes that we introduced in February, those returns that we expect to get on the sales for the quarter are quite strong. We want to be an active player in this market, we've talked about the fact that we want to continue to be a top 3 player, and we think the VA market is going to grow. So last year we really took some time and began thinking about how we could play in this marketplace and have a product that continued to deliver good returns for us but had a lower risk profile and provided good value for consumers. And so as you know, in March, we announced our GMIB Max product. We began selling that product this week, and we really view this product as a significant leap forward in terms of how VAs are going to be constructed in the future. It builds off the GMIB platform that we have and many of the mechanics that are in the new product are the same. But it's different in that, there's a limited number of fund choices. There's 4 protected growth funds plus a government bond fund, and the way that these funds are built is that they’re designd to manage equity, market volatility and interest rate exposure inside the funds. And the goal is really to mitigate some of the extreme outcomes that you can see when there's market volatility and manage some of the risks to deliver more consistent returns. And we think this provides a lot of benefits for consumers who want more stable account values and long-term performance, but they also provide some benefit for us because equity market risk and interest rate risk are mitigated because the hedging is done inside the funds as opposed to outside. Now you did mention the 6% rollup and we felt the 6% rollup is important in order to get advisors and clients interested in this particular product because we expect it to be a significant part of our sales in the future. It in no way indicates that we're getting into any kind of an arms race, as it relates to VAs. This new product at a 6% rollup provides strong returns with a lower risk profile and provides great value for consumers. So we feel pretty good about this product, and it's something that we're going to watch very closely over the coming months. As I mentioned, we just began selling this product earlier this week.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Macquarie Securities. [Technical Difficulty]
A. Mark Finkelstein: So just to go back to that point, the reason that the volatility in the new VA product is lower is because the fund choices are more conservative and the hedging is done within the fund as opposed to at the higher level. Is that the right way to think about that?
William Mullaney: That's right. There's a greater level of hedging done inside the funds, number one. And then secondly, there's a limited number of funds and so -- that people can invest in. So when there's equity market volatility, unlike some of these asset transfer features that are in other kinds of products, the professional management of these funds along with the hedging is designed to really limit extreme market volatility having a significant impact on returns.
A. Mark Finkelstein: Okay. And how does the margin expectation or I should say the return expectation on the new product compare to the legacy product?
William Mullaney: The return that we expect to get on the new GMIB Max is a slightly better return than we expect to get on the current product.
A. Mark Finkelstein: Okay. And then just changing gears a little bit, you've talked a lot about sales in Japan, obviously, very strong quarter, not affected by the earthquake. Can you just talk about Alico trends outside of Japan in terms of sales levels?
William Toppeta: Sure. It's Bill Toppeta. I would say in most of the regions around the world, we're strong on sales, and the only exception that I would make to that is Europe. I would say Europe sales have been a bit weak compared to plan. Some of that is connected -- I think most of that, it's fair to say, is connected to sales of credit life insurance in Europe connected to less lending in the region. So I think as the lending comes back, we would expect the credit life sales to come back, but that's the only soft point. I think everybody else is extremely strong, and of course, overall, we're way up on sales.
A. Mark Finkelstein: Okay. And then final question real quick, do you see the spreads in Corporate Benefit Funding as sustainable from here out on a core basis, obviously, backing off the variable income outperformance?
William Wheeler: Yes, if you normalize to the top end of variable investment income, obviously, part of the reason Corporate Benefit Funding did so well was the high performance of variable investment income. But if you sort of normalize that outperformance, yes, I think those spreads are sustainable. What we've also seen is our core spread has improved in variable investment income because we've -- I would say we're more fully invested and we're probably managing -- we've lengthened a little bit to, I would say, better match the liability duration. So that's what's driving the margin improvement there, and that is sustainable.
Operator: We have a question from the line of Tom Gallagher with Crédit Suisse.
Thomas Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG: First -- 3 questions. First is, Bill, can you expand a little bit on this change in earnings definition about how you're, I guess, what excluding GMIB, is it the change in the liability because I don't think those were marked. Are you trying to just get rid of the disconnect between performance of the hedge asset and the lack of mark of the GMIB liability? That's my first question. Second question is just a further elaboration on MetLife Bank. I heard the answer that directionally 1Q is weak. I didn't hear a response as to whether or not you still think you can get to a $200 million level for the full year, so if you could provide more color on that. And third, can you give us an update on what's going on with how far out you're hedging your Alico Japanese earnings? I think you had -- last comment that I recall you making was 70% of 2011 was hedged at 86 yen/dollar. Have you added to that program? And how far out are you going? Are you going out to 2012 or 2013?
William Wheeler: Okay. See if I get them all. With regard to the earnings definition of GMIB, our changing operating earnings, so we obviously hedge the GMIB rider, and so the change in value of the derivatives was in the operating earnings, and that was -- so as stock market goes up, those derivatives, those hedges actually are negative as you might guess, because they're hedges, and then that's offset somewhat by the reserve adjustments we would have to make regarding the GMIB rider. But this is one of those moments where we make a good economic hedge, but the accounting hedge is not perfect. And so we were always explaining every time there was a big move in the stock market, either negative or positive, you'd see a meaningful change in the value of the derivatives. And because of where we are and I would say the DAC amortization quarter, we're now below the midpoint, so what that means is our DAC amortization is very stable, which is good. That's what you want. But it means it doesn't react meaningfully to changes in the market in any given quarter. So you have a kind of a noisy mismatch between DAC amortization and the riders. And so this quarter, for example, if we had not made this change, we would have seen obviously a very positive event, a nice rally in the stock market in the quarter, but it would have actually cost us money in operating earnings because of how the hedge works. Now obviously, that's not, I think, directionally appropriate. And also, by the way, it's not -- it makes us not comparable with all our peers who are in the same business, who have all now moved all this hedging activity below the line. So that's why we made this change. It makes us more comparable, and I think it also just helps make our operating earnings results for any given period make more sense. So that's regarding the earnings definition with regard to the bank earnings projection.
Donnalee DeMaio: On the earnings -- this is Donna DeMaio. On the earnings projections for the bank, we would expect our run rate more to be in the range of $30 million to $40 million a quarter, really due to the softness in the housing market. Again, when the original plan was put out, the overall mortgage market was projected to be around $1.5 trillion plus. That was revised late last year to be more around $1 trillion to $1.2 trillion. Our results are a direct result of the size of the market, but as long as unemployment stays high and the market stays soft, we will be impacted. Also coupled with interest rates hovering around 5%, the refis have substantially gone down, which will also impact our business. So our run rate will be more in the range of $30 million to $40 million a quarter.
William Wheeler: So just to add onto that a little bit, Tom. When we gave our Investor Day guidance last December, we talked about the bank earning something slightly over $200 million. Of course, what happened immediately after Investor Day is interest rates shot up. That changed the overall projection regarding mortgage originations in 2011, and so we revised the bank's plan pretty meaningfully, even before the year ended, and I think we talked a little bit about that though we didn't quantify the new target. So we feel the bank is performing pretty much in accordance with our new plan projections. And finally, your question regarding yen hedging, hedging of earnings on the yen. We have not made any additional -- or nothing of substance in additional yen hedging of earnings with regard to Alico Japan. I would say, in general, we don't intend to hedge exchange rates to protect ourselves with earnings volatility. I'm not sure, in general, that's money well spent. We -- because we're not -- unlike some others for instance, the yen, which is our largest foreign currency exposure is only 20%, and it's rare that all the currencies move in the same direction in any given quarter. So there will always be -- some will be up, and some will be down. And I think spending a lot of money trying to minimize volatility there is probably not prudent. That said, I think there are some -- occasionally opportunities where the market environment is such that we -- that it makes sense to put on a hedge, and of course, that's what we did this year when we had such a big tightening in the yen versus the dollar over the last 9 months or so. And I'm not sure we will add to this yen hedge. We might, but I don't think there's any guarantee that we will.
Operator: We have a question from the line of Ed Spehar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Edward Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch: A couple of questions. First, Bill, on the issue of systemically important financial institutions, considering that you were -- I guess how do you avoid being categorized as such considering that you're one of the 19 companies in the government stress test? And then I have a couple of follow-ups.
William Wheeler: Well, you're right. We are one of the top 19, and so I think by definition, that makes us a SIFI under the law. But I don't necessarily believe all SIFIs are going to be treated the same. And I think there's obviously a good basis for that in terms of how SIFIs are dealt with. I don't think we're all -- I don't think there's anything that's in the law that says all the rules have to be the same. And of course, we don't know who else may be labeled as SIFIs or not with regard to our peers in the industry whether just because they’re large or because they own thrifts. And I think that there is uncertainty about that, and that will have to sort itself out over time.
Edward Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch: Do you have any indication based on preliminary discussions that there is some carving out occurring even under the SIFI proposals?
William Wheeler: I think we heard the same rumors that everybody else does. And so I think the rumor of the moment is that the insurance industry will -- may not be labeled as SIFIs. But I think we're months away yet from any kind of ruling from the FSOC. So I think there's -- so I think it's really -- it's too early to really to call this.
Edward Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then the final question is on cash flow and statutory earnings. What's the typical -- could you just remind us the typical pattern of the domestic subs in terms of the first quarter as a percent of the full year? And also, if you look at the sources of cash to the holding company outside of the domestic subs, what are the relevant numbers to talk about there at this point for the first quarter or maybe thinking about the full year?
William Wheeler: Sure. So our statutory earnings from our domestic insurance companies for the full year would be roughly $2.5 billion. And though the statutory accounting is interesting at times, and so that number can jump around a little bit. Last year, for instance, it was more like $3 billion. The first quarter is generally a weak quarter with regard to statutory earnings, and there's some reasons for this. But the biggest reason has to do with how we deal with hedging or reinsuring A/XXX and XXX risk. We don't do that. To save money, we don't necessarily true up our hedging of those what I would call real straining reserves. We don't true up our hedging of that every quarter. We do it periodically over the course of a year. And so because -- that's one big reason why statutory earnings are generally lower in the first quarter, and there are some others. But so the way to think about this $600 million of operating income is it's almost exactly the same number that we had last year, okay? So operating earnings in our domestic life insurance subs on a statutory basis is basically flat year-over-year. So in my mind, it's a good result and kind of consistent with our history. With regard to cash flow outside our domestic subs, we've talked about 2 things. We've talked about that we do expect dividend payments from both our newly acquired Alico businesses as well as some of our key MetLife International businesses, mainly Mexico. And we think that sort of ongoing dividends, normal dividends from those operations should well exceed $500 million a year, somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion a year. Given how fast we're growing in some of these countries -- and by the way our growth rate, obviously as we've shown this quarter, is quite fast. There is also an opportunity that which we discussed on Investor Day to take some special dividends out of some of the Alico subsidiaries or branches because of the high level of capitalization of those subs and branches when we acquired the company. They were carrying quite a bit of capital over and above which is needed to support the operations. So we estimated that at roughly $1 billion, some of which is in Japan and not readily accessible, but we expect to pull out most of that excess dividend, a lot of it this year and maybe the rest of it over the next year or 2.
Edward Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch: And just one follow-up, Bill, on that $500 million to $1 billion of dividends from Alico and other international, how would that compare to whatever the statutory earnings type number is? Like what type of a payout is that from those subs?
William Wheeler: I think roughly 50%.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: So a couple quick ones. Just to be clear, on the hedging cost and the change in the accounting, the actual cost of buying the hedges though is still in your operating earnings, correct?
William Wheeler: No, not necessarily. The cost is -- because the fees that we record from the GMIB riders, which obviously pay for the hedges, we pulled those out of operating earnings as well. So that's all now below the line.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Okay, got it. Then just to think about equity market sensitivity, obviously, a substantial change in your business mix and the change in the VA hedging accounting. Can you sort of update us on what you think your sensitivity is to a 1% move up or down in the S&P?
William Wheeler: Yes, a 1% move now is about $0.02 a share over the course of a year. And that means we're not really that sensitive to equity movements obviously because of where we are in the back quarter with regard to amortization. We're in such a stable place that it's just not going to fluctuate that much.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Okay, okay. Then just a quick question following up on Bill Mullaney's comment on the VA sales. Just wondering if you can give us a sense for what "quite strong" means for the returns on the recently sold business, Bill.
William Mullaney: Sure, John. We've always talked about acceptable returns for us being north of 15%. And so the product that we're putting in the market today meets that definition.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Okay. And then finally, just on group insurance sales, can you give us some sense for what your sales looked like in the January 1 or first quarter sales? And how competitive an environment it is? And what that means for premium levels in 2011 for Group Life and Non-Medical?
William Mullaney: Sure. Well, I think you saw that our revenues were down in both the Group Life and Non-Medical Health, Group Life in particular, Non-Medical Health was roughly flat year-over-year. That's pretty consistent with what we talked about on Investor Day for Group Life. We said that Group Life would be down. It's down a little more in the first quarter, but we expect that to even out more towards the back half of the year, so we’ll come in within the guidance we talked about on Investor Day. Sales, in general, were weak, particularly in the large end of the market. There was less quoting activity for very large cases, and for the cases that we did quote on, what it would take for us to win that business particularly in life insurance would have been to write those cases at a level that was far below what we were comfortable with. And we also lost a couple of large cases, which I mentioned at Investor Day. But we are seeing, I think, some improvement in the pricing environment in certain segments of our business. Disability, in particular, I think you saw that we had strong disability results this quarter, which was a function of improving incidents, a return to more average historical levels for recoveries. But also the fact that we've been taking pricing actions over the last 2 cycles that allow us to get a good return at these elevated incidence levels. And we think that, that's going to force the market to begin to bring their prices up to more in line with what the current performance of the businesses are. And the last thing I'll just mention is -- you may have seen that we were awarded the TRICARE Dental business, which is a pretty significant dental contract for us. And that will be having an impact in our business in 2012.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Thanks very much. Just a quick follow-up. I mean, so, Bill, so order of magnitude, I mean -- can you sort of -- can you give us a sense for how much group insurance sales were down year-over-year?
William Mullaney: Yes, I would say as a working number probably 25%.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: With most of that, I assume, driven by the large end of the market?
William Mullaney: Yes. We didn't really have a large case sale in 2011, which is rare for us. We usually have 1 or 2 big case sales. And we just didn't have any of those this year, and that was really the difference.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Smaller end of the market, flat to up or...
William Mullaney: Yes, smaller end of the market is performing within our expectation, so we feel pretty good about that.
John McCallion: Thank you everyone.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife, Inc. 's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife, Inc. specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Conor Murphy, Head of Investor Relations.
Conor Murphy: Thank you, Roxanne. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. We're delighted to be here this morning to talk about our results for the quarter. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplements, both of which are available at metlife.com.  A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible, because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment-related gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.  Joining me this morning in the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments, we will take your questions. And here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management, including Bill Mullaney, President of U.S. business; Bill Toppeta, President of International; Bill Moore, President of Auto & Home; and Donna DeMaio, President of MetLife Bank. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rob.
C. Henrikson: Thank you, Conor, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into our earnings results, I'd like to say that 2010 was a very good year for MetLife. We had strong top line growth, and our operating earnings increased significantly. We remained committed to the fundamentals of our business, and we're continuing to gain market share. In addition, we are proud to have completed the largest, most strategic and transformational acquisition in MetLife's history, which has propelled us into becoming the leading global life insurance company.  Now let's get started on our results. Overall, for the fourth quarter, MetLife delivered very strong performance, growing premiums, fees and other revenues to $9.7 billion, up 4% over the prior year and 12% sequentially. Operating earnings grew significantly to $1.2 billion, up 46% over the prior year and 32% over the third quarter of 2010. Our book value increased year-over-year by 16% primarily attributable to strong operating earnings and investment performance.  Our businesses are performing well. Our underwriting results are very stable, and we continue our commitment to expense management as evidenced by the $700 million in annualized savings we highlighted at Investor Day. And also, our investment portfolio remains strong and experienced an excellent quarter. Steve will discuss investments in more detail in a moment.  Now let me share a few highlights from each of our businesses. In U.S. business, premiums, fees and other revenues were $7.2 billion, down from the prior year and flat versus the prior quarter. Operating earnings grew by 10% over the prior quarter, and we were down slightly over the prior year period. I'm pleased with the financial results in U.S. business, a direct result of our disciplined pricing and continued focus on risk management.  Within our Insurance Products segment, premiums, fees and other revenues were $5.1 billion, down 4% over the prior year and up 4% over the prior quarter. Group life earnings were down somewhat year-over-year as expected. Individual life earnings were down $74 million versus the prior year. The earnings decline is almost entirely attributable to the net difference in DAC [Dental Advisory Council] unlocking and other adjustments between years.  Non-medical health premiums, fees and others declined by 4% from the prior year period. Lower earnings in individual disability offset improvements in dental and in group disability, where incidents remained elevated but recoveries are improving.  In Retirement Products, the top line was strong at $812 million primarily due to continued momentum in our third-party distribution channel and improving investment margins. Total annuity sales were solid again at $5.5 billion, driven mostly by another record-setting quarter, where we reached $5.1 billion of variable annuity sales, up 38% from the prior year period and 10% from the prior quarter.  Operating earnings were $175 million, up sequentially but down year-over-year. In Corporate Benefit Funding, operating earnings were very strong at $283 million, up 51% versus the prior year period and up 55% sequentially mostly due to higher core and variable investment income. Revenues are down from the year-ago period due to lower structured settlement sales and lower pension closeouts. However, fourth quarter saw an increase in pension closeout sales as compared with the first three quarters in 2010.  Rounding out the U.S. business segments. Auto & Home had another very solid quarter with net written premium up 4%. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 90.0% compared with 91.8% in the prior year quarter. Turning to International. Fourth quarter premiums, fees and other revenues of $2.1 billion grew 75% over the prior period and 70% over the prior quarter. The notable increase is largely due to the addition of one month of Alico results in the quarter. The pre-transaction MetLife International operations continue to perform very well, again, achieving double-digit sales growth across all the regions.  Beginning with our Latin America region, the sales grew 24%, driven by strong growth in Mexico and Brazil. Asia Pacific grew 12% due to higher sales in Korea and China. And in our European region, sales increased by 47%.  MetLife Bank achieved operating earnings of $46 million, bringing the total for the year to $267 million, down 10% over last year due to lower mortgage servicing revenues. But still a great result.  Looking back at the full year of 2010, I'm pleased with our strong and consistence performance every quarter. Overall, we grew our premiums, fees and other revenues to $36 billion, up 5% over 2009. We achieved operating earnings of $3.9 billion, an increase of 65% from the prior year. Furthermore, the acquisition of Alico has brought MetLife to the forefront as the leading global insurance provider of income and protection products and services and employee benefit programs.  As we proceed in 2011, the continued integration of Alico will be a high priority. And let me assure you, we also will remain extremely focused on all of our operations. Backed by solid financial position, strong brand and momentum in the marketplace, we have the opportunity to create an even stronger, more valued and more profitable MetLife.  And with that, let me turn it over to Steve.
Steven Kandarian: Thanks, Rob. I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter. First, let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income for the fourth quarter was $423 million, which is $223 million above the top of the planned range. Returns this quarter were driven by both strong private equity results and the increase in corporate bond prepayments. Our outlook for 2011 variable investment income remains in the $225 million to $235 million per quarter range that we provided at our recent Investor Day.  Now let me cover investment portfolio gains and losses for the quarter. Gross investment gains for the fourth quarter were $301 million. Gross investment losses were $184 million and write-downs were $126 million, for a net pretax investment portfolio loss of $9 million. Write-downs included $58 million in structured finance securities and $55 million from corporate credit. Overall, loss levels remain modest given the current economic environment.  Gross unrealized gains in fixed maturities and equity securities were $14.1 billion, down from $19.7 billion last quarter. Gross unrealized losses increased to $6.9 billion from $4.8 billion last quarter driven by a significant increase in interest rates. For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury increased by 78 basis points during the quarter. Overall, the fixed maturity and equity security portfolio was a net unrealized gain position of $7.3 billion at quarter end.  Please keep in mind that interest rate-driven unrealized gains and losses are generally offset by changes in the economic value of our liabilities.  Next, I would like to briefly touch upon our commercial mortgage holdings. First, the loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 66% from 67% due to improving property values. Delinquencies increased to $58 million during the quarter driven by one delinquent loan. We do not expect to incur a loss on this loan. The overall delinquency rate for the portfolio remains low at 15 basis points. While the real estate sector remains challenged and our delinquency rate will likely fluctuate for some period of time, we expect losses to be manageable, particularly given our commercial mortgage valuation allowance of $562 million.  Now let me turn to a few matters relating to our acquisition of Alico. First, I'd like to comment on the overall decrease in our portfolio yield resulting from consolidating Alico. For example, our fixed maturity yield declined during the quarter by 49 basis points to 5.3%. This was driven by lower yield in Japanese assets, which back liabilities with correspondingly low crediting rates.  Next, I'm delighted to report that our integration of the Alico investments portfolio is going well. We have been able to successfully leverage the existing MetLife investment systems and processes to supplement Alico's investment infrastructure. From a portfolio perspective, we continue to manage down certain European sovereign and financial holdings.  Finally, given the recent events in the Middle East, I want to mention that we hold approximately $1.4 billion in assets across 13 countries in the region. The vast majority of these holdings are sovereign debt and bank deposits, supporting insurance liabilities in these countries. As you'd expect, we are monitoring the developments in the region very closely.  In summary, while uncertainty in global capital markets continues, we are comfortable that our portfolio remains healthy and is well positioned to deliver strong shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.
William Wheeler: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. MetLife reported $1.14 of operating earnings per share for the fourth quarter and $4.38 per share for the full year 2010. This morning, I will walk through our financial results and point out some highlights, as well as some unusual items which occurred during the fourth quarter.  Let's begin with premiums, fees and other revenues. Total premiums, fees and other revenues, which were $9.7 billion in the fourth quarter, were up 4% from the fourth quarter of last year and up 12% over the third quarter of 2010. For the full year, our top line revenues totaled $35.8 billion, up 5% over 2009. For the quarter, International revenues, excluding Alico, were up 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2009 driven largely by growth in Mexico and Brazil. International's results also included one month of results from Alico, which significantly impacted MetLife's overall revenue growth.  So let me take this opportunity to briefly discuss Alico's recent financial performance. One month of data is not a very useful way to analyze Alico's results. However, if you look at Alico's overall fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, sales are up 39%, and premiums, fees and other income are up almost 13%. So we are seeing some good top line momentum at Alico.  In terms of profitability, Alico reported $114 million of operating earnings for the one month of its results in our fourth quarter. Alico had some unusual expenses in this month, and we think its normalized operating earnings were more like one $128 million. This figure is consistent with our profit expectations at Alico, although, again, I will caution you that no one should rely very much on one month's results.  Okay, enough about Alico for the moment. With regard to MetLife's domestic businesses, there was a decline in revenue for the fourth quarter. There a number of reasons for this. However, the performance is consistent with the guidance we gave you on Investor Day last December.  Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results. In U.S. business, our mortality results were favorable across the board this quarter. The group life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89.7%, which was flat versus the prior year period and in line with our expectations. For the full year, group life's mortality ratio was 88.7%, right in the middle of the 2010 Investor Day guidance range of 88% to 90%, which is a good result.  Our individual life mortality ratio for the quarter was 82.9%. This quarter's results were a little higher than the very favorable prior year quarter of 81.1%, but it's still very favorable to our plan. The non-medical health total benefits ratio for the quarter was 89.7%, which was down from the prior year quarter of 90.2%. In dental, our underwriting results continue to improve, demonstrating that with better claim activity, combined with our pricing strategy, is working well.  Disability results improved versus last year, but continued to be below plan. We saw meaningful improvement in recovery experience in the quarter but incidence remained elevated. For the full year, non-medical health's benefits ratio was 89.2%, which was well within our 2010 Investor Day guidance range of 88% to 90%.  Turning to our Auto & Home business. The combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 95.2% for the fourth quarter, which was up over the prior year quarter's results of 92.3% due to higher catastrophe levels this year. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 90% in the fourth quarter versus 91.8% in the prior year period. A non-catastrophe prior-accident year reserve release of $16 million after tax was taken in this quarter compared to a $9 million after-tax release in the prior year period.  Moving to investment spreads. We saw continued strong investment spreads this quarter driven by both strong variable investment income and solid core results. For the quarter, variable investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $138 million or $0.17 per share above the top end of the 2010 quarterly guidance range. Remember, we have now raised our variable investment income guidance range for 2011.  Moving to expenses. Our operating expense ratio for the quarter was 23.8%. While our operational excellence initiatives continued to prove successful, the ratio was negatively impacted by the Alico acquisition and lower premiums in our domestic business in the quarter. For the full year, the operating expense ratio was 22.6%, which was within our Investor Day guidance range of 22.4% to 22.8%.  Turning to our bottom line results. We earned $1.2 billion in operating earnings or $1.14 per share in the quarter. Remember that this includes one month of Alico operating earnings of $114 million and both higher interest expense and shares outstanding related to the acquisition. The result of these items is a net dilutive impact of $0.15 per share in this quarter.  Included in our fourth quarter results was an unfavorable market impact of $48 million, or $0.06 per share, as the DAC amortization adjustment, increase of 10% in the S&P 500 in this quarter, was more than offset by the impact from our variable annuity hedge program. In addition, the completion of our annual review of DAC assumptions resulted in a reduction of U.S. business operating earnings by $17 million or $0.02 per share this quarter.  With regard to investment gains and losses, in the fourth quarter, we had after tax net realized investment losses of $42 million, which included net investment portfolio losses of $4 million after tax. With regard to derivatives, we had after-tax losses of $1 billion driven primarily by higher interest rates, changes in currency exchange rates and an improvement in MetLife's own credit spread in the quarter.  From an interest rate risk standpoint, MetLife uses long-dated, receive fixed and pay-floating interest rate swaps to extend the duration of our asset portfolio. This is done to maintain the desired duration match against our long-dated liabilities. These swaps behave just like bonds in response to interest rate changes. That is, they lose value when rates rise. And this change in value runs through our income statement.  Additionally, owned credit continues to drive accounting volatility and derivative gains losses related to our VA [variable annuity] program. As a reminder, the accounting rules require that we consider MetLife's owned credit when fair valuing the FAS 133 embedded liabilities in our VA products. The key point here is that the accounting volatility that this requirement brings to our income statement is truly non-economic in nature.  Our preliminary statutory operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010, excluding Alico, were approximately $1.8 billion, and our preliminary stat [statutory] net income was approximately $1.7 billion. Obviously, a terrific result. For the full year 2010, preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income were both approximately $3.4 billion as we recorded only $21 million in realized stat losses in 2010.  Total adjusted capital at year end is approximately $26 billion, up 8% for the year. We have not finished our RBC [risk-based capital] calculations for 2010. But based on our work to date, we estimate that our consolidated RBC ratio will end the year at approximately 450%, which is above the 2010 Investor Day guidance range of 410% to 440%. Also, a very good result.  Cash and liquid assets at the holding company at year end were $2.7 billion. During the fourth quarter, the holding company paid our annual common stock dividend amounting to approximately $780 million. In summary, MetLife had a very good fourth quarter and full year 2010. Our investment performance continues to improve. Our operating margins remained strong driven by disciplined underwriting and expense management, and our earnings continue to grow. Also, our Alico acquisition seems to be up to a good start.  And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Crédit Suisse.
Thomas Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG: Bill, I just wanted to follow up on your comment on statutory results. Did you say you had $1.8 billion of stat earnings in 4Q?
William Wheeler: That's right.
Thomas Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG: Did that include the impact of those derivative losses? Or is that in the captive and treated separately?
William Wheeler: Well, the answer is it's complicated, as everything with regard to stat accounting is. So most of the changes in derivative values, if they come through on our stat statement at all, will come through sort of, I would say, below the income statement or there'll be changes in our stat surplus numbers. Now a lot of the changes in derivatives don't affect our stat accounting. It sort of depends on what kind of derivatives they are. Also, part of the reason that stat earnings are so good this quarter is because the environment got a lot better. And so some of our reserves, which are really driven by interest rates or where the S&P 500 is, obviously, those reserves declined during the quarter. And so that drove the number up.
Thomas Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG: So, Bill, suffice to say that if I looked at your surplus number, that would have gone up by less than what would be reported on net income because there's a below-the-line element for stat accounting.
William Wheeler: Yes, there's other things, too. So for instance, our total stat surplus, and again these are domestic Insurance businesses, it's up 8% year-over-year. Now remember, one thing we took out is very substantial dividend up to the holding company this year, roughly at $1.7 billion. So you have to factor that in as well.
Thomas Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG: So with the 450% RBC, with the dividend you took, what's the update on your overall capital position?
William Wheeler: Well, I hesitate to kind of give the same kind of chart that we did on Investor Day. We don't like to kind of just chew that up every quarter. But I would say that, look, the capital levels and excess capital that we showed on Investor Day, the numbers are better. And mainly because this improvement in the RBC ratio versus what we estimated on Investor Day equates to and another $1 billion plus of higher capital versus where we were a couple of months ago.
Thomas Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG: Can you comment at all about visibility on alternative returns, at least for 1Q? Because I know there's a lag element, so I assume 4Q and 1Q may not look too dissimilar?
Steven Kandarian: Tom, I'd say that the range we gave you at Investor Day, which actually I misspoke in my script, I said $225 million to $235 million per quarter, I meant to say was $225 million to $325 million per quarter. That range is something we still feel comfortable with at this point in time. I know we've had a good couple of quarters here with variable investment income, but our view is that some of that, certainly, was driven by a couple of factors you might not see in the current year. One would be some sales that were in anticipation of tax changes; try and pull forward some sales into 2010 when the tax situation might be more favorable. That's sort of off the table for now. The second is, you saw some remarks on the cost basis funds, and that was off the real lows we saw in 2008 when things are marked down. That's driven by a couple of factors. One, a major bounce back in the equity markets and improvements in the below investment-grade market, which drives a lot of these valuations. So we think that the guidance we gave you at Investor Day in December still is appropriate for today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Sanford Bernstein.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: To follow up with Steve, if I go back to the Investor Day and your presentation, you laid out your interest rate outlook on a quarterly basis across the yield curve. And if I just zero in on the 10-year, it looked like you weren't expecting to get to sort of $345 million until really the end of 2011. Given where we are in the 10-year today, should we assume that you are sort of have been investing sort of in the course of fourth quarter of 2010 and the first part of 2011, obviously, at prevailing rates, so all else equal, those numbers should be better for operating EPS?
Steven Kandarian: Well, rates have risen, but of course, as crediting rates on the liability side. And it isn't always a 1:1 relationship, but there's certainly a close correlation between the two. So overall, I'd say that somewhat higher interest rates are favorable for our business. There's no question about that. We talked about hedges we put in place to offset some of the low our interest rate environment on Investor Day. But certainly, on balance, somewhat higher interest rates is favorable for our business.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: And did the crediting rates adjust sort of in line with the incremental new money investment rates? I thought there's maybe a lag or something like that.
William Wheeler: Suneet, there is a lag. Just building on what Steve said a little bit, all of our products have different crediting rate strategies. Sometimes the crediting rate changes immediately because it's basically a floating-rate liability or, I'm sorry, sometimes it doesn't change except for maybe once a year. Then of course, we have a bunch of liabilities where the crediting rate never changes. But with regard to things like new business, stuff we're selling new today, obviously, that would be on using whatever the prevailing interest rates are. So the story is a little different depending on which sort of product and business you look at. But again, I think the punch line is, is that, yes, higher interest rates, certainly, for a while here, are going to generally have a favorable effect on our earnings. So it's early days. So we've only been enjoying these high interest rates now for, I don't know, three, four months. So it won't have that much impact yet.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: The second question I had, actually, was for you, Bill, in terms of capital. You'd mentioned that the RBC is a little higher than you thought and the operating environment is a little bit better. Per your Investor Day, there's been no discussion or there was no assumption for share repurchase. Since the earning season started, we've started to see some other life insurance companies dip their toe back in the water there. Any change in terms of your thoughts on redeployment of capital this year, especially as the AIG lockup expires in August?
William Wheeler: There's nothing new to say now. Obviously, it's without a doubt, the environment continues to improve, and that's all good. But in our mind, it's still a little early to announce any kind of buyback activity.
Operator: We have a question from the line of Colin Devine with Citi.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: First, Bill, with respect to the derivatives losses, could you just give us a little more granularity as to how those break out and what sort of liabilities they're matched against? Second with Steve, what was the impact on your RBC, the NAIC's [National Association of Insurance Commissioners] changes to the factors on CMBS [commercial mortgage-backed securities]? And then lastly, Bill Wheeler, back to you, with respect to RBC, are you factoring in your International businesses for that and doing some sort of consolidation? Or is that really now just stand-alone on the U.S. and less applicable as a number as we think about Met's capital position?
William Wheeler: So with regard to derivative losses. Now you can kind of break it -- there's really three buckets. The first is changes in interest rates, and I mentioned these a little bit in my remarks. Many of our long-dated liability portfolios, we extend the duration of the assets effectively by buying swaps. And so probably like roughly 40-plus percent of the derivative loss this quarter was driven either by the decline in value of those swaps or interest rate floors that we've also purchased to protect against that low interest rate environment and we talked about, on previous calls, we've talked a lot about those floors in the last year or so. So that's a big piece of it. A comparable piece is driven by changes in the evaluation of the embedded derivatives in our variable annuity program, where when we change -- so that would be another 40-plus percent of the decline in derivative value. And that's really where we have to value this derivative under GAAP accounting. The discount rate that we used to value that derivative, it has to be tied to our owned credit. MetLife's owned credit -- this is all, of course, good news. Our credit default swap spread declined from basically, roughly, a little over 200 bps at the beginning of the fourth quarter to something like a little under 150 bps at the end of the fourth quarter. So that's a 60-plus basis point move in our credit default swap spreads. It's a pretty big move. And because of that, the change in the discount rate, when you value the embedded derivative, comes down. That means the liability is worth more. And that has a big impact, too. Hopefully, you followed all that. Finally, the currency, we did have some fluctuation in currency. We use derivatives to protect ourselves in many different areas regarding currency moves. And the value of those -- and sometimes those qualify for hedge accounting but sometimes they don't. It's the match between what's being hedged and the terms of the derivative aren’t perfect. So there, some adjustments in the value of the yen versus the dollar triggered maybe roughly a 15% decline in derivative value. So the big three reasons that we purchase derivatives, interest rates, currency moves and, of course, this thing with the VA program, they all kind of moved in the same direction this quarter in a very meaningful way. And so that's what drove the numbers. So that gives you a little more granularity, hopefully. I can do the RBC one. You want me to do that one, too, because it's a very simple answer. The change in RBC driven by the PIMCO program was worth literally one point. I'm sorry, BlackRock, not PIMCO, sorry. PIMCO was last year. Yes, the BlackRock adjustment was worth one RBC point, literally one, one good guy. And then finally, you're absolutely right about the RBC calculation. RBC is a domestic concept for measuring solvency for U.S. insurance companies; so that 450% that we talk about is our U.S. insurance companies consolidated number. By the way, even though Alico, technically, is a U.S. statutory insurance company, we don't include that number. And remember, I said this on Investor Day, that we don't -- the right way to evaluate Alico's capital adequacy is not to talk about its RBC ratio, it's to look through the business to the capital adequacy numbers in each of the various countries. And actually today and, certainly, on Investor Day, we talked about Alico having an excess capital of over $1 billion based on when we bought the company. So that its capital position, also, is in a very good shape. And then, of course, our own International operations also, in aggregate, have excess capital over and above what they need. So whether you're talking about internationally or domestically, we're in very good shape from a capital point of view.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: So where would Alico's Japanese capital ratio then have ended the year, since that is one thing we can sort of compare to other companies?
William Wheeler: So the SMR, the solvency margin ratio, which is sort of like the U.S. RBC -- and this is under the old basis, which is still the basis that's being used in Japan. I think the rules are going to change, I think, at the end of 2011. But the SMR in Japan was approximately 1,400, which, again, is obviously quite good.
Operator: We have a question from the line of John Hall with Wells Fargo.
John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: I just want to stay on the issue with statutory RBC for a second. What was the big delta from the range that you were talking about at the analyst meeting in December and the 450% that you're talking about now?
William Wheeler: Well, I would say the biggest thing is, remember, we did the Investor Day on early December. And if you remember, December was a pretty fun month from a move in the S&P 500. And also, interest rates moved up during that month, too. So the macro environment changed for just in being at one month, the macro environment changed pretty materially. And so that allowed us to release some of these contra reserves that we sometimes have to hold against our VA product and stuff like that. So that would probably be a big driver. I think, too, when I got quizzed on Investor Day about the RBC ratio, I admitted that maybe our guidance was a little conservative. We always tend to do that, because it is the number we only calculate fully once a year. And so we always want to make sure we're conservative in terms of our estimate.
John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Since the Investor Day, the strong macro environment that you talk about, a couple of other things that you've spoke about in the past, i. e. the interest rate sensitivity and the impact that low interest rates might have other on the company, as well as embedded equity market guidance that you've built into your or the assumption you built into your guidance, the environment has changed. What's that doing to your expectations on those items?
William Wheeler: I'm not sure what to say other than it's better. Yes, because the good news, of course, is that so far this year, the environment continues to improve in terms of both view of how the equity markets are going and where interest rates are. So obviously, we feel very positive about that.
John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And I guess the final question has to do with the very strong variable annuity sales and deposits. How much is enough? Is there a point where you have to put on a governor to control the growth to some degree?
William Mullaney: John, it's Bill Mullaney. Just to give some comment on the quarter overall for VA sales, obviously, a strong quarter, up 38%. We think the market grew fairly significantly in the quarter too. We don't have the full fourth quarter numbers, but we think year-over-year, the market could be up somewhere between 10% and 20%. And so obviously, we saw our share improve. We continue, we believe, to be the number two player in VAs, and we've talked about the fact that we want to be in the top three. We feel very comfortable with the level of business we wrote in the fourth quarter. I think some of the changes to the macroeconomic environment, that you reference, have helped. The improvement in the S&P and improvement in the interest rates have brought the returns on the business that we're writing now up into the target range. So we feel pretty good about that. As we've talked about before, there is some risk associated with this product, and it's a product that we continue to look at very closely and look at the risks that we're taking. We continue to hedge, and we're also continuing to look at what product features we might bring in to continue to manage the risk appropriately. But we fee pretty good about the business we're writing right now.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Can you guys talk some about the impact that the move up in rates had on C-3 Phase 2 calculation? I think in December you talked about it maybe being a 20-point drag given where rates were at the time?
William Wheeler: Chris, I'm just trying to remember when I would have said that what the C-3 Phase 2 impact would have been a 20-point drag. That's not my recollection. C-3 Phase 2, for everybody's benefit, is a stochastic model, stochastic calculation we have to do at year end. And it's complicated. And then obviously, it takes into effect the things like interest rate movements and given -- for our overall domestic business. I can't tell you off the top of my head exactly where C-3 Phase 2 came out of for this year, though it was pretty benign. And you would expect it to be given the move up in interest rates. So, Chris, I think we'll have to get back to you with something more specific about that.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then maybe one for Bill Toppeta in terms of the conversion from branches to subsidiaries of Alico, how that process is going and timeline?
William Toppeta: Sure, Chris. I would say it's going according to plan. It's a project that's going to take a number of years. So I would say, certainly, two years and maybe plus. And as you may recall, the agreement that we have, the closing agreement, gives us three years to complete the process. So I'd say we're on track, and it's going well, particularly in the more significant jurisdictions.
Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: One quick one for Bill Mullaney. Just in terms of the ROIs that you pointed to and the VAs being weaker in the back half of the year and leading to some repricing. Can you comment sort of the move up in rates, some of the repricing? What you expect that to do to the ROIs?
William Mullaney: Sure, Chris. What I said in an earlier call, it was either for the second quarter or the third, was when interest rates were down and equity markets were not performing -- we thought that the ROIs were in the low teens but we were covering our cost of capital. Since the macroeconomic environments have improved, we're seeing our ROIs now in the mid-teens.
Operator: We have a question from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: I want to come back to the capital and potential for capital management, maybe slightly differently, Bill. Given the credit performance, especially in the quarter, if we look past the derivatives and look at the true credit metrics, can you give us a sense for how that performance, maybe it's for the full year 2010 but certainly in the back half of the year, is comparing against some of the expectations from the key rating agencies and whether you think that could potentially alter the outlook here?
William Wheeler: Yes. Well, I would hope it would alter the outlook, let me put it that way. Just for everybody's benefit, obviously, we've gone through -- two years ago, we went through a pretty difficult credit cycle. And no, I think, our losses were -- given where people's expectations are, our losses ended up being, obviously, on the low end of that. And really, for the last three quarters of 2010, our credit loss expectations, our actual results were way below that. And so the credit story was really quite good. If you recall, last summer, when we commenced our equity financing for Alico, we ended up having to raise incremental $1 billion of common as part of the financing mix to kind of satisfy some of the rating agency concerns about potential losses, especially in the real estate area. And I think we said at the time, and we've been pretty consistent on this, that we did not expect material losses in real estate. And of course, in the two-plus quarters since then, the story has been fantastic in terms of delinquencies and how our reserve has built up. We've actually been forced to release some of our loss reserve in the real estate area. So the story just couldn't be much better. So certainly, those fears that some of the rating agencies had about losses have not occurred. And our outlook for 2011 is that our investment performance, from a loss perspective, is going to be pretty consistent to what it's been the last couple of quarters, two, three quarters. So we think just as a capital adequacy issue, this is really -- it's not a big deal, and we're doing very well. So I think that will probably help influence the rating agency outlook. So to go kind of to your base question, is this going to change views about capital management, I think it will. But I think it does take a little time to have that happen, but I suspect it will change how the rating agencies feel.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Put that together with the expectation that the federal government sort of stress tests, too. Is that still expected to be -- have you guys submitted your information? Is that supposed to be sort of done here in the next couple of months?
William Wheeler: Yes, you got it right. We have submitted, I guess, our report about our stress test calculations based on their guidelines. We've submitted those to the fed. Well, I don't know if there's an official report back date. I think people's expectation is, is that we will hear something from them by the end of the first quarter. I don't think, however, that those results are ever -- unlike the stress test that recurred in 2009. I don't think those results are ever going to be made public. But my guess is people will be able to puzzle out who did well and who didn't.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: And then final question is just on one of the businesses. I was hoping you guys could discuss the underwriting results in non-medical in a little more depth. When I look at most of your competitors, the majority of them have seen stable to improving results in their comparable business lines this quarter. It's still not great but it's, at least, relatively stable. Your results kind of stand out in contrast to that, so maybe a little more color there.
William Mullaney: Sure, John. It's Bill Mullaney. Let me give you some perspective on the major businesses. First of all, dental continues to perform well. Claims are stabilizing there. And as we've talked about, we implemented some price increases in late 2009 that are taking effect throughout 2010. So dental is performing at expectation. Disability, although we're seeing some modest improvement, as Bill Wheeler talked about in his comments, it continues to lag what our expectations are. Incidence continue to be high, and recoveries are starting to improve a little bit, which is helping the results. So it has improved over the year-ago quarter but still below where we would want it to be. We also had, on some of the smaller businesses in that segment that we don't talk about very much, some volatile claim activity in our accidental death business as well as our Individual disability business, some high claims there. And that had some impact on the results. And then the last thing I will say is we did have higher expenses in the quarter in that segment. There were some one-time charges that we took associated with our decision to no longer sell new business for long-term care. And so those expenses showed up in the fourth quarter, and we don't expect them to show up in 2011. So the guidance that I talked about at Investor Day for 2011 for that segment, we continue to feel very comfortable with.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: That was going to be sort of my follow-up. If you look at some of that, you used the term volatility claim activity and these higher expenses, is that enough, if that were to dissipate to get you back to your guidance range?
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Macquarie.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Macquarie Research: I mean really since December, you've seen equity markets up, rates higher, you got the active financing exception legislation. We can all do the math on what that means for estimates and I'm not really getting at kind of changes in guidance or anything. But when we think about those items, and they are pretty meaningful, I mean, what are the offsets? I mean, what are the areas of softness that are in there that we should think about in terms of maybe moderating expectations somewhat?
William Wheeler: Mark, well, I'm glad you asked that question. Well, obviously, we've had a lot of good news since Investor Day, both in terms of interest rates, the stock market, tax relief, a lot of good news. There are a couple of offsets, I would say. One is our PGAAP [purchase GAAP] -- on Investor Day, we said PGAAP wasn't done, it was close to done. It is now just finishing up getting finalized. I think our PGAAP accounting adjustments are going to be slightly less positive in terms of Alico accretion. It's not that material, but it's a little less positive. And the other thing I'd say is one offset from higher interest rates is the bank's profitability. MetLife Bank's profitability is probably going to be a little lower than what we originally forecast on Investor Day. And that has to do with both higher mortgage rates, there's going to be less volume, and as well as, I think, margins will be affected a little bit. So there are some offsets. Obviously, it's still in that positive story. But that, what I would say, are the two big areas of weakness.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Macquarie Research: And then, I guess, you gave a good story on Alico in the month, in November, but it was one month. I guess, is there anything you can kind of give us in terms of just how December or even January looked from a sales perspective?
William Toppeta: Mark, it's Bill Toppeta. Again, a month or two doesn't make a trend, but I would say that what we're seeing is positive and certainly consistent with the plans that we gave you on Investor Day. So I would say good, as far as we go. But again, I would underline what Bill said earlier, a month or two doesn't make a trend.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Schuman with KBW.
Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Let's go first back to Alico. You talked about the very strong sales this quarter. Can you give us a little bit of sense of what you're doing there? Is this essentially represent Alico just getting fully back on its feet and kind of reclaim its historical position with historical products? Or are there some new things that you've done there to kind of stimulate that?
William Toppeta: Yes. It's Bill Toppeta. I think the story is mostly attributable to Alico getting back to its pre-crisis levels. You remember on Investor Day, we gave you a chart on lapses and surrenders. And we said that the trend was getting back and below pre-crisis levels. That trend, I'm happy to say, continues since Investor Day. Also, with respect to sales getting back up to pre-crisis levels, that trend continues. And I would say, as Rob said at the beginning, the focus really is on the fundamentals of the business. It's on life insurance sales, accident and health sales, through the three or four strong channels that we have, so certainly face-to-face, but also a comeback in the bank channel and in the direct marketing channel. So it's basically a focus on the fundamentals, core products, core distribution and getting back to pre-crisis levels.
Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: And then, Bill, can we sort of go back a little bit more on the banking. You talked about 2011 guidance being at risk. And in fact, I think if we annualize the fourth quarter, it would suggest that we're below that run rate. Is the fourth quarter kind of the run rate you're thinking of now for '11, or is there downside from that level?
William Wheeler: It's probably close to the run rate. I think what we're expecting for the full year now -- if you took the fourth quarter times four, I think you'd come up with about $190-plus million of earnings. It's possible it might end up a little softer than that. It’ll really, in my mind, depend a little bit on the overall macroeconomic recovery for the country in terms of what will housing starts ultimately do and new house buying activity. That'll obviously influence a little bit. People are expecting that, in terms of the new residential mortgage volume that's going to get originated in this country, like, this year is going to be the lowest it's been in 30 years. So it's not a very good environment.
Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Well, part of what happened in the fourth quarter -- it looks like OpEx came up quite a bit sequentially. Is that an aberration, or is that indicative?
William Wheeler: I'm sorry, Jeff, I couldn't quite catch that.
Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Operating expenses came up, I think, quite a bit sequentially in banking. Is that the new level, or was that an aberration?
William Wheeler: Well, there is a little of both. There is some unusual expenses, spending activity going on as we're revamping some administrative issues in terms of how we process new mortgage applications. So there is some spending going on there, but some of it is an aberration. It has to do with, remember, how we pay commissions and how commissions get paid in that business when volumes occurs. So at the beginning of that quarter, we had probably some of the highest volumes of the year when interest rates were still very low, and then it tapered off very quickly. But the commissions still had to get paid in that fourth quarter.
Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: And then just lastly, pension closeout sales came up in the fourth quarter, is that indicative of a trend or was it just a good quarter?
William Mullaney: Well, it's hard to say whether it's indicative of a trend. It's Bill Mullaney. What I would say is interest rates going up certainly helps the environment for that business. And the equity markets going up certainly helps the funding level of pension plans. So I would say as the macro environment continues to improve, that's certainly good for that business. As Rob said in his remarks, closeout sales were up sequentially for the last few quarters. It's mostly a collection of smaller deals, fairly well balanced between the U.S. and the U.K. So we continue to have discussions with plan sponsors and intermediaries about pension closeouts. And so we think that, over time, that's going to continue to be a good market for us.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Ed Spehar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Edward Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch: First, Bill, I was wondering if you could help us on the statutory earnings going into 2011, the $3.4 billion. It sounds like maybe a little bit of that was unusual. Can you tell us roughly what you think that run rate is heading into '11?
William Wheeler: Yes, I think our estimate for 2011 is somewhere between $2.5 billion and $3 billion.
Edward Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch: And if we look at the comparable number for Alico, what would that be?
William Wheeler: Roughly $1 billion. And so the piece you’re still not catching is MetLife International, legacy International, which I don't have a conservative number on that -- it’s for the legacy business, too.
Edward Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch: That's in the $1 billion or not in the $1 billion?
William Wheeler: No. The $1 billion is Alico stand-alone. I'm not sure exactly what the number is for legacy International. I would think it's something like $400 million or something like that, maybe $500,000,000.
Edward Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch: And then what's the target right now in terms of what you want to hold at? The $2.7 billion at the holding company, what's the amount again that you want to hold?
William Wheeler: I think the minimum that we have to hold is roughly $1 billion.
Edward Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch: And then one question on interest rates. Rates, obviously, have come up a lot. How high is too high for the 10-year Treasury? When does it become an issue of turning from a positive to a negative?
William Wheeler: That's not an easy question to answer. We were discussing this last night because, obviously, somebody asked this last night. Talbi thinks that if it gets to 6%, if the 10-year Treasury gets to 6%, then maybe we should start thinking about that. So we went and looked up when the last time the 10-year Treasury was at 6%, and it was right around the year 2000, so basically, a decade ago. So needless to say, we have a long ways to go. And so it's hard to discuss that these upward moves, especially long-term rates are just anything except good. Obviously, it's a positive development for us.
Edward Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch: And I'm assuming that it would make a difference if that 6% occurred in one year versus two years.
William Wheeler: Yes, absolutely right. I mean, a real -- a very abrupt move, probably causes some disintermediation in some blocks of business, at least for a period of time. But the net result would still be -- we'd take that and still be thrilled.
Edward Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch: Can you just remind me again why when the market's up 10% we have a negative DAC adjustment for the equity market?
C. Henrikson: Well, you have a DAC true-up in terms of DAC amortization, right. So your DAC amortization should -- if you have a big move in the stock market, your DAC amortization should slow, right. That's the true-up because of the market performance. So that's a good guy. But offsetting that, and more than offsetting that for us, is our hedging activity for the SOP reserve that we have in our GMIB [guaranteed minimum income benefit] annuity, which is all above the line. We think that the reserve that GAAP makes you put up is probably not the true economic reserve. And we're trying to hedge to the economic reserves in our GMIB annuities. So you get a little mismatch between sort of what we think of our economic hedging activity versus the GAAP reserve or GAAP accounting. And we've just decided that it's more important to hedge the economic situation versus somehow -- but unfortunately, that causes us a little GAAP noise.
Conor Murphy: Okay. Thank you, everyone.

Operator: Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results, and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife, Inc.'s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife, Inc. specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Conor Murphy, Head of Investor Relations.
Conor Murphy: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. We are delighted to be here this morning to talk about our results for the quarter. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplement, both of which are available at metlife.com on our Investor Relations page. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible, because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment-related gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments, we will take your questions. Here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of the management, including Bill Mullaney, President of U.S. Business; Bill Toppeta, President of International; Bill Moore, President of Auto & Home; and Donna DeMaio, President of MetLife Bank. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rob.
C. Henrikson: Thank you, Conor, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to begin with some comments on the acquisition of ALICO. As you know, we expect to complete the deal very soon, and let me remind you what this will do for MetLife. It will be rewarding to our shareholders and will significantly accelerate our strategy by improving our long-term growth in revenues, in earnings and in ROE. It will increase our global presence in both emerging and mature markets, many in which MetLife will have a top five market share, and will give us the opportunity to become the leading life insurance and employee benefits provider in the word. Now let me share our overall MetLife results for the quarter. MetLife performed well, with continued growth in both our top and bottom lines. We generated premiums, fees and other revenues of $8.6 billion, up 2% over the third quarter of 2009. We increased operating earnings to $878 million, up 22% over the prior year period. I'm also pleased to report that our book value improved considerably, up 24% over the year-ago period and 8% sequentially, driven by our strong operating earnings and our investment performance. Driving this quarter's growth is our continued focus on the fundamentals: disciplined growth, excellent underwriting, solid expense control and strong investment returns. You'll hear more from Steve Kandarian in a moment, but I'd like to say that we continue to be pleased with the investment portfolio performance. Investment losses, including impairments continue to trend lower. This was partly due to our best-in-class real estate portfolio, we're loan to value's improved again this quarter. Our reserve against future losses came down further, and now our delinquencies have fallen back to just two basis points. Turning to our Domestic business segment results, U.S. Business generated premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.1 billion, flat over the prior year period, though up modestly, excluding the impact of lower pension closeout activity which, as you know, can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Operating earnings grew by 21%, with significant increases in each of the major segments, largely driven by very strong underwriting results, as well as the benefit of ongoing expense management. In our Insurance Products segment, premiums, fees and other revenues were consistent with the third quarter of 2009 at $5 billion. And operating earnings grew 14%, up in each product line. Group Life premiums grew 2% and operating earnings were up 6% compared with the prior year period. The Group Life mortality ratio was very good at 89% and has remained below Investor Day guidance each quarter this year. Non-Medical Health revenues were up slightly, reflecting higher dental revenue though partly offset by lower disability revenue. Operating earnings grew by 49%, driven by improved interest and underwriting margins. The Non-Medical Health benefits ratio remained good at 88%, consistent with the second quarter. Individual Life premiums, fees and other revenues were down due to unusual items in the year-ago period and flat when normalized. Operating earnings grew by 5%, reflecting solid mortality results. In Retirement products, the top line to grew $738 million, up 11% on sales high persistency and higher fee income. Variable annuity sales reached a record of $4.7 billion, up 35% over the third quarter of 2009, driven by momentum in third-party distribution channels. We also are benefiting from additional distribution relationships launched over the past year. Operating earnings increased 42% due to growth in net flows and higher net investment income. In Corporate Benefit Funding, premiums, fees and other revenues of $618 million were down year-over-year, driven by less pension closeout activity. However, structured settlement premiums grew by 2% over the prior year period and 4%, sequentially. Operating earnings increased 35% over the prior year due primarily to higher investment income. Auto & Home had another strong quarter. Net written premiums increased 3% to $780 million. Operating earnings were strong at $81 million. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was excellent at 88.2%. MetLife Bank had a record quarter. Total operating revenues for the bank increased 8% to $410 million, driven by higher mortgage servicing revenue and more refinancing activity. Operating earnings grew 26% to $101 million. Now turning to our current International business, we achieved another very strong quarter with growth across all three regions. On a recorded basis, premiums, fees and other revenues of $1.3 billion grew 16% over the prior year period. Operating earnings increased by 25% to $191 million due to growth in the business and a onetime tax-related benefit. In our Latin America region, growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil contributed to its top line growth of 21%. The Asia Pacific region grew 11% due primarily to higher sales in Korea and Hong Kong. And in our Europe Middle East and India region, the top line increased by 7%, reflecting continued growth in Europe and India. Earlier this morning, we announced the sale of our Japanese joint venture to our joint venture partner. The agreement we have reached is in the best interest of our shareholders, policyholders and employees. Though we have enjoyed an excellent partnership and much successful joint venture, we cannot leverage our expertise and position in the Japanese market to focus on ALICO in Japan. As we move forward, we will transition to a global enterprise through refreshed strategies, enhanced operating models, expanded global branding and engaged in a committed management. I look forward to our Investor Day on December 6 when you'll hear more about how we will deliver increased value to our customers and shareholders as the leading global insurance company. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.
Steven Kandarian: Thanks, Rob. I would like to review some key components of our investment results for the quarter. First, let me begin with the variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income for the third quarter was $292 million, which is $92 million above the top of the planned range that I provided on Investor Day. This is primarily driven by strong private equity returns across our global portfolio. We are currently seeing similar private equity funds take advantage of improving market conditions to accelerate realizations, which is leading us to believe that barring any unforeseen market events, variable income should remain strong throughout the rest of the year. Now let me cover investment portfolio gains and losses. Gross investment losses for the third quarter were $215 million. Gross investment gains were $212 million and write-downs were $98 million for a net investment loss of $101 million. These levels are in line with the past several quarters, and we believe are modest given the current economic environment. Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $4.8 billion, down from $10.8 billion at year end. For the quarter, gross unrealized gains increased $5.5 billion to $19.7 billion as interest rates and credit spreads declined. For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined 46 basis points and spreads for investment grade corporate credit declined approximately 20 basis points. Overall, the fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio was a net unrealized gain position of $14.8 billion at quarter end, a dramatic improvement from a $24.4 billion net unrealized loss just six quarters ago. As to our commercial mortgage portfolio, as Rob mentioned, the loan-to-value of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 67%, down from 68% last quarter as valuations continued to improve in markets in which we invest. Our commercial mortgage valuation allowance declined by $48 million to $573 million. Approximately $20 million of the decline was a reduction in our FAS 5 general reserve due to improved market conditions. The remaining decline is largely due to the resolution of certain delinquent loans in our U.S. portfolio. Total delinquent commercial mortgage loans decreased to $8 million from $137 million last quarter, with no delinquencies in our U.S. portfolio at the end of the third quarter. The decrease in delinquencies was driven by one loan being paid off at 98%, and the transfer of a high-quality property to our real estate equity portfolio. I should caution that our delinquency numbers will fluctuate over time as challenges remain in the commercial real estate market. Nevertheless, we believe that we will continue to maintain relatively low loss levels and outperform the overall market. Finally, let me comment on our cash position, which increased from $20.4 billion last quarter to $26.1 billion this quarter. The vast majority of this increase can be attributed to the cash that we are holding for our ALICO purchase. In addition, cash collateral balances relating to our derivative counterparties increased. Excluding the impact of these two factors, our cash position remains consistent with second quarter levels and is down approximately $4 billion since Investor Day, as we reinvested into higher-yielding assets. In summary, we believe that our portfolio remains well positioned for the current economic environment. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.
William Wheeler: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. MetLife reported $0.99 of operating earnings per share per share for the third quarter. This quarter's results include a dilutive impact of $0.08 per share, resulting from the ALICO equity and debt issuance and completed in early August. This morning, I'll walk through our financial results and play out some highlights, as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter. Let's begin with the top line. Total premiums, fees and other revenues which were $8.6 billion in the third quarter were up 2% from the third quarter of last year, and up 4% when adjusting for closeout sales in both periods. As we have noted before, closeout sales can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and have been adversely impacted by this low interest rate environment. U.S. Business premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.1 billion were essentially flat as compared to the prior year quarter. This includes a modest decrease in Insurance Products revenue due to Individual Life's 4% decline. Adjusting for a few unusual items recorded in each of the periods, Individual Life's top line was actually down less than 1%. Group Life premiums were up 2% from the prior year quarter. As you may recall from my second quarter remarks, growth in Group Life is being helped by a change in the financial terms in a large retrospectively rated contract, which resulted in less reinsurance ceded. As this change occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009, the benefit to Group Life top line's growth over the prior four quarters will not repeat in the fourth quarter of this year. Overall, Group Insurance revenue continues to be impacted by high unemployment and our unwillingness to chase business at below desired margins or returns. Also, revenue in Retirement Products increased by 11% due to higher separate account fees from positive net flows and favorable separate account investment returns. Also, Group revenue and Corporate Benefit Funding was down 13% from the prior quarter, driven by lower closeout premiums, which I referenced before. Structured settlement premiums remained strong. Auto & Homes revenues were up by 2%, and MetLife Bank's revenues grew by 11%. International's revenue was up 16% on a reported basis and 11% on a constant-currency basis over the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all three regions and led by Mexico, Korea and Chile. Operating margins. Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results. In U.S. Business, our mortality results were favorable this quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89% versus our estimated range of 90% to 95%, which is a good result. Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 86.7%. This quarter's results were higher than the very favorable prior quarter of 80.4%. That said, the ratio was significantly below the prior year quarter, 91.2% and also below our plan. Overall, another good result. At 88% for the third quarter, the Non-Medical Health total benefits ratio was up slightly over the sequential quarter of 87.8%, but favorable to the prior year quarter of 90.7% and well within our investor good day guidance range of 86% to 90%. Dental underwriting results continue to see stable utilization and favorable pricing trends. Disability margins continue to be below plan, as incidence levels remain elevated and recoveries continue to be below expectations. Turning to our Auto & Home business, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 93.6% for the quarter, which was up over the prior year quarter's results of 91.1% due to higher catastrophes in the current quarter. The combined ratio, excluding cats, was 88.2% in the third quarter versus 87.7% in the prior year period. A non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve release of $3 million after-tax was taken in this quarter, and that's compared to a $7 million after-tax release from the prior year period. Moving to investment spreads. We saw a continued solid investment spreads this quarter, driven in part by strong variable investment income results. For the quarter, variable investment income after-tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $56 million or $0.06 per share, above the top of the 2010 guidance range. As Steve explained, this was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. Moving to expenses, our operational excellence initiative continues to prove successful. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 22.5%, which is a solid result and was in the 2010 guidance of 21.8% to 22.5% given at Investor Day. Turning to our bottom line results, we earned $878 million in operating earnings or $0.99 per share. Included in our third quarter results was an unfavorable market impact of $36 million or $0.04 per share, as the increase of 11% in the S&P 500 this quarter was more than offset by the impact from our variable annuity hedge program. In the second quarter of this year, we had essentially the opposite situation, where a 12% decline in the S&P 500 was more than offset by the results of our hedge program creating a $0.05 favorable market impact in that quarter. In addition, our total operating taxes of $378 million includes a true-up in our effective tax rate for the year from 27% to 28%, as well as a net tax benefit of several onetime items in the quarter. Overall, the result of various international and domestic tax issues impacted operating earnings by $90 million or $0.02 in the quarter. With regard to investment gains and losses, in the third quarter, we had after-tax net realized investment losses of $222 million, which includes net investment portfolio losses of $72 million after-tax. Impairments were $64 million after-tax in the third quarter and continued to trend down. In addition, as Rob mentioned, we have sold our Japanese joint venture and announced the sale to our joint venture partner and recorded an impairment, which shows up in realized investment losses. With regards to derivatives, we had after-tax losses of $190 million. MetLife uses derivatives in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. The decline in the relative value of the dollar as well as the tightening of MetLife's own credit spreads, partially offset by declines in interest rates, resulted in the derivative loss for this quarter. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's own credit spread do not have an economic impact on the company. Our preliminary statutory earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were approximately $850 million, and our preliminary statutory net income was approximately $800 million which is a good result. Cash and liquid assets at the holding company at quarter end were $9.8 billion. Please keep in mind, this total includes the ALICO financing, which we completed in early August and the total was $6.5 million. In summary, MetLife had a good third quarter. Our investment performance continue to improve. Our operating margins remain strong by disciplined underwriting and expense management, and our earnings continue to grow. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question, we go to the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley: My question is on interest rates. Appreciate the commentary you provided regarding the impact for 2011. Couple of questions on that though, first, is that just your expected spread compressions? Or does it also incorporate other taxes such as top line pressure and pension expenses? Also how much of impulse that is foreign exchange going to be to the interest rate impact as we look to 2011?
C. Henrikson: So just for everybody's benefit, we filed an 8-K a month or so ago which said that in 2011, sort of given the current interest rate environment, we expected that to impact operating earnings by $0.20 a share. Now the way we came up with that calculation, most of that $0.20 is from investment spread compression. But we also did factor in at least a preliminary estimate on how our pension costs might change. And obviously, that will get trued up at year end, given where the stock market is and frankly, where the interest rates are on December 31 because that's how the math works on the pension cost. So that was factored in, Nigel. We did not consider impacts to what I would say top line issues, which are obviously a little harder to quantify. And the most obvious impact of that is where our pension closeout sales which are soft now, and I suspect we don't think we're going to get meaningfully better next year until interest rates start to improve. So that's most of the issue. FX is actually having -- you saw a varied strong decline in the value of the dollar versus the yen and the euro this quarter. And the FX impact for international is actually quite modest. I mean, it's a gain but it's less than $0.01. Now with ALICO, that will change and the FX impact will be more pronounced. And so if you think about it, what that really means is ALICO's earnings expressed in dollars are probably going to be stronger, all things considered than we originally estimated because when we announced the deal, we assumed one set of exchange rate and the dollar has weakened since then. So ALICO's earnings impact is going to be better. Now we don't really take the spot rate right now. We look at the, I guess, what we consider to be the forward exchange rate, which where the dollar I think is expected to rally a little bit. So the impact may not be as significant as you might first think. But that will obviously get -- we'll obviously kind of wrap that all up on our guidance for 2011 on Investor Day.
Operator: Our next question, we go to the line of Colin Devine from Citi.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: Bill, Ameriprise, on their call yesterday, brought up the issue that they're seeing much higher persistency on their annuities than they had modeled. And had adjusted their DAC amortization period rather dramatically in response to that. And I was wondering if you've done anything at Met on that, if you're seeing those trends, if that's the sort of thing we should be expecting from you, I believe Ameriprise took their fixed annuity DAC ammortization up to 30 years and doubled their VAs to 40. That's the first question. And then the second one, and really perhaps, really, for Rob. While, I'm happy to see you get out of the VA joint venture in Japan frankly, does this signal somewhat of a change in strategic direction for Met with respect to your global appetite for Variable Annuity business?
Steven Kandarian: I'm not going to comment on Ameriprise, I refuse. But I will say this, we'll do our normal DAC unlocking study that we do in the fourth quarter. We'll obviously do that again in this quarter. And I would say the following. We do see persistency improving in our Variable Annuity business and that shouldn't surprise anybody, frankly, given where interest rates are and where the stock market is. I don't believe that's going to cause us to change our DAC amortization policy or the period of time, just for everybody's benefit. We would amortize variable annuity back over 20 years. And in our fixed annuity DAC, we would amortize I think also over 20 years. But the way that works is there's a rate guarantee in your deferred annuity contract and what we assume is a pretty big -- when the rate guarantee comes off, that DAC model would assume a pretty big shock labs, something like crudely 50%. And so most of the DAC is very -- ammortization would be very front-end loaded. But if people stay, then the rest of it would run out to 20 years. So that's sort of our policy, and I don't really expect that to change.
C. Henrikson: I agree with you and I'm glad you stated it the way you did. We're really quite pleased at the way we've been able to exit our JV in Japan, both for us and quite frankly for our JV partner. This of course from our point of view gives us, as I mentioned in my comments, the ability without any distraction to focus 100% on our ALICO business in Japan and that's a good thing. Relative to variable annuity appetite, I think everyone expects from me somewhat of the same comment about variable annuity, and it's the same worldwide as it would be in the United States. And that is we think that there is a terrific need in the savings arena for the type of products and services we can provide, both from the standpoint of the accumulation of assets and the creation of income for Life. We think that's very important. At the same time, we've always said, we do not want to become overly dependent on any one product for our financial health. And I would include variable annuities in that statement, so that the growth opportunities for us worldwide, it varies by country to country. I don't think you would see our growth being driven, for example, 100% by variable annuity sales anywhere. But we do see significant opportunities relative to ALICO. As I've mentioned, our first focus is on bringing home exactly the business that we analyzed and we love so much, the Accident Life Insurance and so forth. In addition to that of course, we bring competencies to the ALICO family that they were in some cases precluded from using because of their sister companies at AIG and so forth. And so, we very excited about it. We love the Variable Annuity business. We're not in love with it, but it is a very attractive product for our customers worldwide.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: Rob, given the relatively negligible amount of money involved on this JV for a company of your size, then I'm glad you brought up your last comment because I was going to play it back to you, should we really be interpreting this as that you're a little less in love with the VA business than you were before? Then you can stay in this JV if you want to.
C. Henrikson: Well, I don't want to go to a long explanation of how in love I have been and whether or not that answer would meet major expectation. But look at it this way. We have been very, very focused on return on capital and the returns we can get relative to our breadth of products and services that can both increase our ROE, increase our margins and have the best use of capital for the company. And so that's basically the answer. I am definitely in love with anything that can deliver that kind of result to our shareholders.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne Agee.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Any update you can provide as to the outlook for the earnings accretion from ALICO, given the changing interest rate and FX environment since the deal was announced. I was just wondering if the move, especially the move in rates has had any impact on your their estimates for VOBA or goodwill. We saw some impact across the river, and I was just wondering if we should think about any out during of the altering of the closing stream upon the closing there? Also related to ALICO, wondering if you have any update for us on the progress you're making with the regulators overseas as it relates to getting dividends out? And then finally, I had a question on your Group Disability business. Can you give us a sense for where the new claims discount rate sits and what kind of sensitivity we should think about? And is that in your $0.20 estimate for interest rate pressure, too?
C. Henrikson: I'll start with ALICO earnings accretion. Again, just for everybody's benefit, when we did our financings in August, we refreshed the guidance we gave. We said expected to be $0.40 to $0.45 accretive in 2011. Interest rates were pretty low then. I think they're actually a little lower now, and I think probably the dollar is a little weaker. I'm not sure those quite offset each other, but they obviously they're doing that. In terms of the purchase accounting, well again, we did revised purchase accounting when we did the financings in August. Now that we're going to close the deal very soon, we will put out some revised purchase accounting in an SEC filing, I guess later in November. So you'll get to see the math as it currently stands. It's interesting. It's complex, okay? But the punchline is that you will see some changes in the VOBA, in goodwill balances. A little bit more of the purchase place will end up getting pushed to goodwill versus VOBA. That has the effect of probably improving earnings accretion. So directionally, in terms of reported earnings accretion it's probably, there's upward pressure. And so that's all good I think.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: And then any progress on the capital?
William Wheeler: John, it's Bill. You want the answer, or you want the answer on the regulatory one first? We're just about there. I mean, we had to get, as you know, a large number of regulatory approvals. We've got just about all of them at this point. And we fully anticipate that we will have all of them, and we will close on November 1.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: I was more asking -- I'm glad to hear that, but I was more interested in I know there have been some discussion early on, maybe it was right around the announcement of capital levels in ALICO being sort of substantially higher than is sort of required under a reasonable solvency level there, solvency capital level. I was just wondering if there's any progress on timing for being able to get some of that capital back out into the holding company.
William Wheeler: Look, our expectation is, is that we will pay dividends out of ALICO in 2011, probably later in the year. And I would say that capital level -- I mean, we expressed RBC ratios -- we talk about an RBC ratio for ALICO and we talk it will be at 400 or comfortably above 400. And when we actually do the final audits of the opening balance sheet when we buy the business, we'll know exactly what it is. But I think the punchline is that the capital levels of ALICO are quite attractive. And so we'll be able to pay out a very healthy dividend out of ALICO in late 2011. The question, Mark (sic) [John], is really will we be able to give anything out of Japan in 2011 just because sort of wrinkles how the regulatory issues will work there. And I don't think there's anything new to say other than we think ALICO Japan is very well capitalized, but it could very well be a couple of years before we'll be able to pay dividends out of it. And obviously, that'll be a subject of ongoing discussions with the regulator there. The money is there. It's a matter of what would the dividend end out of in 2011. We just don't know yet.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Just a follow-up, Bill. I think you said you expect to pay dividends there in ALICO in 2011 later in the year. Is that from just other geographies? Or does that get to the holding company or does it get to an intermediary holding company? I'm not clear.
C. Henrikson: Well, it's a great question. Actually, yes, it's coming from other geographies, and the capital levels in those other geographies are frankly quite good. And then weather comes to the U.S. holding company or sits in some sort of international holding company, it is all about the tax regime in a given country and it's all over the map. As you know, I think Japan dividends can come back to the U.S. holding company because the Japan corporate tax rate is basically the same as the U.S. corporate tax rate, I think people know that. But in other geographies, the policy differs.
Operator: Our next question, we go to the line of Mark Finkelstein from Macquarie Securities.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Macquarie Research: I have two margin questions. I guess firstly, how should we think about this level of variable annuity sales? I mean obviously, very strong in the quarter. But just given where rates are, our margins meeting targets in the sales? I assume hedging costs are higher, and do need to reprice? That's number one. And then secondly, can you just discuss what is the strategy to improve margins in disability? It sounds like we had adverse experience both in incident levels and recovery rates.
William Mullaney: Mark, it's Bill Mullaney. I'll handle both of those questions. First of all, on VAs. The market for VAs continues to be good and I think you saw from our sales results really for the whole year that sales have been pretty strong. And we've been getting sales primarily from the GMIB product, but also from the increasingly from LWG product as well. Given where the current interest rate levels are, the margin on the products that we're selling today are below what I would say our target margins. But I think you've got to think about this business over a cycle. And so earlier in the year, when interest rates were higher, margins are good and we were writing at returns that were higher than what our target returns are. So we think overtime, as interest rates come back, we'll start to see returns improve close to the target. But we're also going to be taking some steps in 2011 to continue to improve the overall margin in the product and the overall level of return. And so we'll be telling you more about that in the coming months. As it relates to disability, obviously, our disability results continue to be challenged in this quarter. We saw higher incidence levels than we've seen in prior quarters. Our recoveries ticked up a little bit but it was very, very modest improvement in recoveries. So as a result, the overall loss ratio in disability was pretty high. It was probably one of the highest that we've had over this past cycle. So there's a number of things that we continue to do from an operational perspective to try and improve our Disability business. We're also taking some pricing actions again with both our New business and our Renewal business for 2011. So we're in the market right now. I would say high single-digit disability price increases as a way for us to bring in more revenue for the product and begin to get the loss ratios and the margins back to target.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Macquarie Research: I guess just as to follow-up on that. I mean, will that market accommodate that level of rate increase based on what you're seeing currently?
William Mullaney: Well, we have seen I think a little bit of an improvement from a marketplace perspective. I would say over last couple of years, disability pricing has been fairly aggressive. And so when we've gone to the market with price increases, we've lost some business and we haven't been as competitive on new business. It's one of the reasons why the top line in the Non-Medical Health area really hasn't grown very much. And I expect that we're going to see that trend continue to a certain degree. But I think based upon the early results, and it's still a little early in the sales cycle, pricing seems to be moderating a little bit more in this renewal season than it was in a couple of earlier years. And so we think we have a better chance of getting our pricing But what I'll tell you is if we can't, we're not afraid to walk away from business if we don't feel that we can get the right level of margin and begin to get our turns back to the right level.
C. Henrikson: Mark, this Rob. I would just add Bill's answers right on across the board. One thing I would just remind everyone because we've said before, even though on variable annuities we may not meet our target rate, we're still exceeding the cost of capital on that business. So it's not like we're writing Variable Annuity product without adding value to the enterprise. That maybe goes without saying, but I think I would have to say it anyway.
Operator: We will move on then to the line of Andrew Kligerman from UBS.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: First, just on the Japan JV and the divestiture. I see over the Newswire I think you received $275 million. What was the impairment that you took? I think Bill mentioned it a little earlier.
William Wheeler: Yes, the answer is complicated but I'll take you through it. We're selling our interest at below where we have it reported on our books. But we're actually not going to close the deal until the first part of next year. So the accounting for this sale is actually sort of in two steps. And so if you collapse, maybe the most useful way to think about it is let's collapse the two steps and I'll give you sort of the net impact. We'll ultimately have to record an after-tax loss on the sale of this of about $60 million and on the sale price of $275 million. Now you'd think well, that's not good. But that $60 million really has more to do with the fact to how we allocated goodwill in the Travelers acquisition five years ago than it has with really the economics of this transaction. We actually expect this transaction to be modestly accretive from an EPS point of view, and we're very pleased with the valuation we received. So there's a little of impairment but that frankly had to do with purchase accounting five years ago than sort of the reality of the situation today.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: Following on Colin's questions, just whether ALICO Japan's prospects for VA sales. Do they have good prospects? Maybe a little color.
William Toppeta: Andrew, it's Bill Toppeta. I would say the opportunity, the prospects are certainly good. And the reason for that is twofold. One is certainly, the technical capabilities that we bring from the MetLife side on variable annuities, which I think are clear to everybody. On the other side, ALICO has very strong relationships with all the banks and the distributors, plus obviously, they have strong independent and captive agency forces in Japan. So it's clear that there is an opportunity there. And as Rob said earlier, I think what this transaction with MSA indeed does for us is it gives us the ability to focus on ALICO in Japan. And that's exactly what we plan to do.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: And then just shifting over to interest rates. And we all know that you'll kind of take a $0.10, $0.20, maybe a $0.20 hit to what would have been earnings had interest rates not been where they are. Can you walk us through three years from now, four years from now? What would be the incremental impact of the 10-year Treasury stays where it is? You talked about how it's based on spread compression, so I guess it wouldn't be a focus on the 5.17% yield and where that would go. More on spread. But in essence, what would happen to expected earnings three years from now? And would you be getting to your long-term goal of 13% to 15% or away?
William Wheeler: Yes, Andrew, it's Bill. That's a really serious question, and I think I'd hesitate to give an off-the-cuff answer. I think we'll do our best on Investor Day to really kind of talk through that issue with people if it stays low for a long time. But I would say a couple of things. One is, these interest rate flows that we have that we're benefiting from today, obviously, and really are quite a good hedge against this problem. Those are going to be -- the very first one of those I think expires in late in late 2014. And most of them, often they go into 2015 and '16. So those are going to help us or be there to help us for a very long time and that's a good thing. The second question is obviously, it is an earnings drag if things stay that low and for long period of time. And yes, I do think that will make hitting our long-term ROE targets much more challenging. But the other kind of a little bit of a subjective wildcard is this, if we really get convinced that interest rates are going to stay low for a long time, we will start managing the business differently. And I think the answer is absolutely. But how do you quantify that in terms of the numbers, I'm not really sure I can really do today. So I think those are two things to keep in mind as we think about this potential issue.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: RBC and excess cash at the hold co post, the ALICO transaction, roughly where do you expect that to be?
William Wheeler: The cash at the hold co will be $3-plus billion at year end. I think as I've said before, we don't give out an interim RBC number. We do the full calculation once a year and that's frankly what we're comfortable with. I would say this, our RBC ratio was 432 at year end 2009. It's clearly higher today. And obviously, that doesn't in take into account cash at any holding company. So we've had good statutory earnings and at the same time, there aren't any extraneous issue which affect the RBC. We don't like to give an interim number out, but it's clearly moving north.
Operator: Our next question, we go to the line of Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse.
Thomas Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG: First question is for Steve. You commented on expecting strong 4Q private equity returns. If we remain in the current environment, do you think that's going to persist into 2011? Or maybe just give some overall views as to what you think is driving those returns. If nothing changes in the macro environment whether it's likely to keep seeing those continue.
Steven Kandarian: I think part of what's driving the returns this year relates to sales driven by improved capital markets around sub debt and below investment grade debt. That's allowing firms to either sell other businesses to other PE firms or industry players or do refinancings and dividending out. So those markets I think are driving a lot of that and people are searching for yield right now as yields are so low. So as of now at least, those markets are quite robust in helping returns. There's also some valuations being done, but are showing improvements based upon higher equity pricing across the board. And that's really taking some very low valuations of a couple of years ago during the crisis and kind of moving them up on the equity methods. Those two things I think are keys. The third probably is concern by people in the private equity world about their tax rates. So accelerating some profits now before their personal tax rates may go up based upon the tax treatment of carried interest. How much of that will go on into 2011? We're still doing some work on that. I'll have some numbers for you on Investor Day. We'll provide you probably a range again like we did last year. We're finalizing those numbers now so I'm reluctant to kind of give out an estimate before we finish our work.
Thomas Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG: So if understood you correctly, maybe the one that would not be sustainable, the one piece of it would be into 2011. There might not be the same incentive on the part of the actual private equity owners to continue to monetize gains.
Steven Kandarian: It depends on policy issues around tax and what happens in terms of Congressional action on that issues. So I think that's going to unfold over the coming months.
Thomas Gallagher - Crédit Suisse AG: And then the other question I had, actually two more quick ones. One, I guess for Donna. Can you talk a bit about the bank earnings? They were very strong in this quarter. Can you talk a bit about whether these are sustainable, I think the comment was they were refi driven. Should we view these as really peak earnings that are likely to come down? Or do you think there's sort of a higher baseline of earnings we've developed here? That's one question. And lastly, in terms of the low interest rate environment, do you see any real signs of repricing yet by competitors for things like variable annuities in Universal Life or do you think that's still to come?
Donnalee DeMaio: This is Don DeMaio from the Bank. Yes, we did have a great third quarter. A lot of it is driven by refis, as well as the fact that margins are holding in the Mortgage business. That is not sustainable, as the mortgage market continues to come down. Those who have the ability to refi have pretty much tapped that out, and we don't see that continuing into the fourth quarter or into 2011.
William Toppeta: Tom, I'll answer your question about the interest environment. I just want to get back to the question we didn't answer about disability and what was happening with the discount rate there on new claims. We don't disclose that discount rate publicly. I will tell you that it's below 5% today. It has been for sometime. We continue to look at it and I would say based on -- we look at it semiannually so based on the current interest rate environment, I will tell you that we'll be looking at it again. And it is under some pressure, and so we'll let you know in the future if we decided to make any changes to that discount rate. In terms of the interest rates overall and the impact on pricing. I don't think we've started to see it a lot yet, although I think we're going to see it if interest rates continue to stay low. I think that the marketplace maybe just staying on the sidelines a little bit longer to see whether or not rates do stay low for a while. If they do, I think we're going to start to see that show up in pricing. But my own sense is it's just a little early yet to see it.
Operator: And our last question today comes from the line of Jeff Schuman from KBW.
Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Tax rate, you marked up the 2010 tax rate. I was wondering if you can give us any perspective on 2011. And then secondly, any updates on retained asset accounts in terms of either customer behavior or the level of sort of regulatory inquiry or where we stand there.
William Wheeler: So I'll do the tax rate. So as you heard in my remarks, we've sort of moved up the effective tax rate. We started the year with a 27% effective tax rate. Given sort of various factors, we've decided to move it up to 28%. I think for MetLife, when I think about 2011, MetLife pre-ALICO probably the effective tax rate we should be thinking more about 29%. So maybe ticking up another point. It's not just, there's not one thing which is driving that. There are couple of things. Just keep in mind though, ALICO's effective tax rate, which isn't really changing, is something like 34%. And so the blended rates for the two companies will obviously be higher, the net live stand-alone. But there is a little pressure on the margin on the tax rates.
C. Henrikson: Jeff, just real quick. This is Rob. On the retained asset accounts, there's really nothing to report in terms of change of activity relative to regulatory and that sort of thing. I would say that, as I mentioned on the last call, we have a very, very, very high level of customer satisfaction with those accounts. And our cash flows would indicate that they're even more satisfied than they've been in the past. So other than that, there's really nothing to add at this point.
Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: So customers are continuing to utilize accounts about the same rate and there's no change in withdrawals from existing account?
C. Henrikson: Yes. Remember, to get in the account, you have to pass away. So we don't have an open account for deposits, but retention is actually drifting a little bit higher than it has been in the past.
Operator: And would you care to make any closing comments?

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter Earnings Release conference call. [Operator Instructions] Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results, and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife, Inc.'s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife, Inc. specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I'd like to turn the call now over to Conor Murphy, Head of Investor Relations.
Conor Murphy: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. We're delighted to be here this morning to talk about our results for the quarter. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplement, both of which are available at metlife.com on our Investor Relations page. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible, because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net Investment-related gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments, we will take your questions. Here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of the management, including Bill Mullaney, President of U.S. Business; Bill Toppeta, President of International; and Bill Moore, President of Auto & Home; and Donna DeMaio, President of MetLife Bank. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rob.
C. Henrikson: Thank you, Conor, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2010, MetLife has again delivered strong results across the board. Remember last December at Investor Day, we highlighted our commitment to discipline growth, margin improvement and ROE expansion. Well, we delivered on that commitment in the first quarter, and I believe we have done so yet again in the second. Our premiums, fees and other revenues increased 4% over the second quarter of 2009. Operating earnings grew to over $1 billion, up considerably from both the year-ago period and sequentially. I'm also pleased to report that book value increased tremendously, up 48% over the year-ago period and 10% sequentially, driven not only by our Investment performance but also our strong operating earnings. At the same time, our ROE continued to improve and we achieved excellent underwriting results. And importantly, we remain committed to expense discipline and risk management. Let me share a few highlights, beginning with the U.S. Business results. U.S. Business generated premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.2 billion, up 2% over the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of lower pension closeout activity, which can vary from quarter-to-quarter, the top line grew by over 6%. Operating earnings grew by 39%, with significant increases in each of the major business segments, largely driven by strong underwriting results. Within the Insurance Products segment, premiums, fees and other revenues grew 2% over the second quarter of 2009, and operating earnings grew 29%. Group Life premiums grew 4% and operating earnings were up 56% compared with the prior-year period. Group underwriting results were excellent, with the Group Life mortality ratio at 86.6%. Non-Medical Health revenues were up slightly, reflecting higher Dental revenue, partially offset by lower Disability revenue. Non-Medical Health earnings were up over 40%, with improved interest and underwriting margins driven by strong improvement in Dental. Group Disability incidents remains elevated but consistent with plan, while recoveries are showing signs of improvement. Individual Life premiums, fees and others revenues increased modestly. And we had a 6% increase in operating earnings, again reflecting disciplined underwriting and expense management. In Retirement Products, the top line grew by 34%, driven by sales and higher fee income, and operating earnings were higher at $238 million. Variable Annuity sales of $4.5 billion were up 11% sequentially and consistent with last year's very high level. Net flows remain strong. Lapse rates continue to decline and the success of our new Fidelity product continues to contribute to our strong results. In Corporate Benefit Funding, premiums, fees and other revenues were down, driven by less pension closeout activity, which I mentioned earlier, although structured settlement premiums grew by 9%. Operating earnings grew to $238 million, up 54% from the prior year, due primarily to higher variable Investment income. Rounding out the Domestic businesses, Auto & Home had another very solid quarter, as did MetLife Bank. Now turning to our International business. We achieved another very strong quarter with growth across all three regions. On a reported basis, premiums, fees and other revenues grew 21% over the year-ago period. Operating earnings declined by 8%. Strong earnings in Latin America, driven by business growth and expense management, were offset by lower earnings in Japan due to the challenging equity markets. In Latin America, growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil contributed to its top line growth of 23%. The Asia Pacific region grew 20%, due primarily to higher sales in South Korea and Hong Kong. And in Europe, Middle East and India region, the top line increased by 13%, reflecting continued growth in Europe and India. In a moment, Steve will comment on our Investment results, but I can't help but highlight one component of the portfolio. We continue to experience a low level of Investment losses, including impairments. This is partly due to the continuing strong performance of our Real Estate portfolio, where you should note that loan-to-value values actually decreased during the quarter. Our reserve against future losses came down, and the percentage of delinquent loans also declined. I think you would agree these are all positive trends. Switching gears. Obviously, the ALICO transaction is attractive to us because of our focus on generating strong consistent earnings growth, expanding ROE and increasing shareholder value. Together, MetLife and ALICO teams are working diligently and have achieved several significant integration planning milestones. So we remain on track to close in the fourth quarter. As we told you when we announced the deal, we continue to be impressed by ALICO's people and how well the franchise has been performing. While we cannot comment on ALICO's second quarter financial results, we are pleased with their first quarter performance. And together, we are working on defining how we will further accelerate our growth strategy. Our Operational Excellence initiative remains on track to deliver the $600 million of annualized expense savings we promised. And it has now been one year since the formation of the U.S. Business organization. The team identified several opportunities to take that business to the next level. Over the past year, we've reaped the benefits of combined sales forces with increased cross-selling opportunities. Secondly, U.S. Business is developing -- deploying Investment dollars across the business in a more efficient way to capitalize on market opportunities. And thirdly, we've identified synergies, giving us the opportunity to reduce overall operating costs. So we're certainly seeing big benefits already from combining the businesses. In closing, this is a momentous time for MetLife, one that will propel us into the next phase of our long and successful history. As I reflect on the first half of the year, I'm very pleased with our performance. We've been enjoying strong momentum and looking ahead, we are very enthusiastic about our future as a global company. With that, let me turn it over to Steve Kandarian.
Steven Kandarian: Thanks, Rob. I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our Investment results for the quarter. First, let me start with a comment on variable Investment income. Pretax variable Investment income for the second quarter was $296 million, which is $96 million above the top of the plan range that I provided on Investor Day. This is primarily driven by strong private equity returns. While we expect variable Investment income to trend lower for the remainder of the year, we believe it’ll still perform within our quarterly range. Now let me cover Investment gains and losses for the quarter. Gross Investment losses were $253 million. Gross Investment gains were $396 million, and write-downs were $172 million, for a net Investment loss, excluding derivatives, of $29 million. Results were largely in line with the previous quarter. Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $7 billion, down from the $10.8 billion at year end. Gross unrealized gains were substantial this quarter at $14.2 billion, as widening spreads were more than offset by declining interest rates. Overall, the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $7.3 billion at quarter end. Next, let me expand upon Rob's comments regarding our Commercial Mortgage portfolio. The loan-to-value of our portfolio improved slightly to 68%, down from 69% last quarter, as valuations have stabilized. Our Commercial Mortgage valuation allowance declined modestly to $621 million. Total delinquent commercial mortgages decreased from $162 million to $137 million. The decrease in delinquencies was driven by the restructuring of one loan, resulting in a $5 million loss. As to the remaining two delinquent loans in the U.S. portfolio, one is expected to be paid off during the third quarter with no loss, and the other is a high-quality property that we plan to transfer to our real estate equity portfolio. As I have mentioned previously, we expect limited losses on these loans, as our recoveries are projected to be above the historical average of 75%. Although some challenges remain, we believe the commercial real estate market is slowly improving and that our portfolio will continue to maintain low loss levels and outperform the overall market. Finally, let me comment on our cash position, which increased from $17.2 billion last quarter to $20.4 billion this quarter. The vast majority of this increase can be attributed to higher cash collateral balances we see from our derivative counterparties. As interest rates and equity markets decline, the value of our derivative positions increased, and we took an additional cash collateral. Excluding the impact of cash collateral from our derivative counterparties, our cash position is down $4.1 billion since Investor Day, as we reinvested into higher-yielding assets. In summary, we continue to see solid results in our portfolio, with a variable income above plan, continued low losses and an improving commercial real estate market. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.
William Wheeler: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. MetLife reported $1.23 of operating earnings per share for the second quarter. As Rob mentioned, this strong bottom line result represents solid business growth, higher Investment income, strong underwriting results and the impact of our expense management efforts. This morning, I will walk through our financial results and point out some highlights as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter. Let's begin with premiums, fees and other revenues. Total premiums, fees and other revenues, which were $8.7 billion in the second quarter, were up 4% from the second quarter of last year and up 6% when adjusting for closeout sales in both periods. As we have noted before, closeout sales can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. U.S. Business premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.2 billion reflect a 2% increase over the prior-year quarter. This includes a 2% increase in Insurance Products revenues, largely driven by an increase in Group Life. Group Life premiums are up 4% from the prior-year quarter, consistent with our Investor Day guidance. Growth was helped in the segment by a change in financial terms and a large retrospectively rated contract, which resulted in less reinsurance ceded [ph] in that particular contract. This change occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 and was anticipated in the guidance we provided at Investor Day. Also, revenue in Retirement Products increased by 34% due to income annuity premium growth, as well as higher separate account fees due to positive net flows and favorable separate account Investment returns in prior quarters. Also revenue in Corporate Benefit Funding was down 17% from the prior-year quarter, driven by lower closeout premiums. Structured settlement premiums remained strong. International’s revenues were up 21% on a reported basis and 13% on a constant-currency basis over the prior-year quarter driven by growth in Mexico, Korea and Chile. Operating margins. Turning to our operating margins, let's talk about underwriting results. In U.S. Business, our mortality results were quite strong this quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 86.6% versus our estimated range of 90% to 95%, which is an excellent result. Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 80.4%. While higher than the exceptionally strong prior-year quarter of 74.9%, the results were quite favorable and well below our plan. At 87.8% for the second quarter, the Non-Medical Health total benefits ratio was down from the prior-year and sequential quarters of 88.4% and 91.2% respectively. This favorable result was due largely to improved Dental underwriting results, in which we continue to see more stable utilization and favorable pricing trends. Disability margins continue to be below plan, as incidence levels remain elevated and recoveries continue to be below expectations. However, we are seeing some early signs of improvement in recoveries. Turning to our Auto & Home business. The combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 95.3% for the second quarter, which was up over the prior-year quarter's result of 93.5% due to higher catastrophes. The combined ratio excluding caps was 85½% in the second quarter versus 88% in the prior-year period. A non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve release of $12 million after tax was taken in the current quarter, compared to our $3 million number in the year-ago period. Moving to Investment spreads. We saw continued strong Investment spreads this quarter, driven in part by variable Investment income results. For the quarter, variable Investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $62 million or $0.07 per share above the top end of the quarterly guidance range given at Investor Day. As Steve explained, this was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. Moving to the expenses. Our Operational Excellence initiative continues to prove successful. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 22.4%, a solid result, and within the 2010 guidance of 21.8% to 22½% given at Investor Day. Turning to our bottom line results. We earned $1 billion in operating income or $1.23 per share. Included in our second quarter results was a favorable market impact of $43 million or $0.05 per share, as gains from our hedge program more than offset the impact of lower equity markets and interest rates in both the U.S. and International Businesses. With regard to Investment gains and losses, in the second quarter, we had after-tax net realized Investment gains of $767 million, which included derivative gains of $878 million after tax. MetLife uses derivatives in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and MetLife's own credit spread, which impacts the valuation of certain insurance liabilities, can generate derivative gains or losses. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's own credit spread do not have an economic impact on the company. In this quarter, we refined our estimate of expected recovery rates for our insurance subsidiaries within the measurement of own credit as of June 30. This refinement resulted in an after-tax realized Investment loss of $621 million during the quarter. Impairments were $112 million after tax in the second quarter, modestly higher than the first quarter of 2010. Our preliminary statutory earnings for the second quarter of 2010 are approximately $220 million, and our preliminary statutory net income is $250 million. Statutory operating earnings were significantly impacted by lower equity markets and interest rates in the quarter and do not reflect the benefit of gains from our hedging program. However, statutory total adjusted capital, which is the numerator in our RBC calculation, increased by $1.1 billion. Turning to our holding company. Cash and liquid assets of the holding company at quarter end were $3.7 billion. In summary, MetLife had a very strong second quarter. Our revenue growth was solid. Our Investment performance continued to improve. Our operating margins remain strong, driven by disciplined underwriting and expense management. And our earnings continue to grow. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have the first question from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Macquarie.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Macquarie Research: I guess it was a good quarter. You had favorable mortality, good morbidity, good Investments results, good expense control across the board. I think if you looked at the core number, it’s somewhere in the $1.10 to $1.15 range. I guess what I'm really interested in is how should we think about this level of earnings? And whether we should be trending off this number, or whether we should be thinking about a little bit lower of a number, just given the level of favorability in the quarter?
William Wheeler: Hi Mark, it’s Bill. I always hesitate to say whether $1.11 is a good run rate or not because -- but I'll give you some sense of kind of the pluses and minuses. You're right; underwriting was very strong. And so I think a lot of that is sustainable. Some of it was probably just good fortune. But I also think, by the way, that like the improvements in Dental underwriting margins are very sustainable. In fact, they might get better from here. And the other interesting fact is Disability underwriting margins were roughly flat on a sequential-quarter basis. But there's potential for a lot of improvement there as early -- maybe in the third quarter, maybe not. But the guys who are very close to that business are encouraged by some of the signs they saw in the second quarter. So certainly, there are headwinds or there are things which might not be repeatable in the second quarter results, but there are further opportunities. I would also -- just a couple of other things to keep in mind is I think the expense picture only gets better as Operational Excellence continues to execute. Though probably the drop in equity markets at the end of the second quarter is probably a modest negative, as we think about third quarter fees in the Retirement business. And then finally, I think the low-interest rate environment that we're in, though I don't think it would be a very large impact in terms of our operating EPS, it will probably slice a little bit off of Investment margin in the future quarters. But I think it’ll be very modest. So that's sort of the color on what's sustainable and what might be in the future, and I’d kind of come away from that little dialogue as that kind of $1.11 current run rate is a number that I think you can think about as a reasonable projection going forward. Could it be a little lower? Sure, but not materially.
A. Mark Finkelstein - Macquarie Research: And then just finally, I know there's a lot of moving parts with equity markets down, interest rates. I think you mentioned adjusted capital is higher. Is there any update you can give on just the overall capital position?
William Wheeler: We don't give out quarterly RBC projections. I just don't think that's a good practice because -- you’ll probably appreciate, the actual RBC projection is a very involved calculation. We don't perform it quarterly. We do estimate our RBC every quarter, so it just strikes me that until you do the real math, you shouldn't put out a number. I think the way to think about this is total adjusted capital, as I said in my prepared remarks, went up $1.1 billion. That's the numerator in the RBC projection, $1.1 billion. Now the denominator changes because the balance sheet’s a little bigger and things have changed a little bit. But $1.1 billion, you think $50 million to $60 million per RBC point, that sort of implies 15 to 20 RBC points in the numerator just in the second quarter, never mind the first quarter, which was another $1 billion increase. So we're clearly building statutory capital versus our RBC at year-end 2009, which was 432%. So we feel very good about our capital levels, and our cash levels with the holding company haven't changed. So I guess I feel that capital position is in good shape.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Hall with Wells Fargo.
John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Just a couple of questions for Steve. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of those gross losses on the Investment portfolio that were realized, where they came from. And I think you sort of indicated along the way that you might be reducing some of your sovereign holdings, and I wonder if any of that activity occurred during the quarter.
C. Henrikson: Actually we did not decrease our sovereign holdings. We didn’t have very many sovereign holdings. You may be remembering some comments I made earlier when you talked about the ALICO transaction. And as you know, pre-closing, we don't control how they manage their portfolio. So I can't really comment on what is going on, on that side of the ledger. In terms of gross losses, it's a fairly varied group of sectors that are contributing to that. So there's no one item that’s sort of jumping out where I can say, “This sector is underperforming on the realized losses.” On impairments, it was more in the area of structured financed assets and there was some in CMBS, some in ABS, and that was the main driver for the impairments.
John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: There was clearly a strong sales quarter building momentum around the Variable Annuity product. Can you give us a sense of how much the Fidelity relationship might have contributed to that? And are there any other, I guess, new sales relationships that could potentially keep that momentum going?
William Mullaney: Hi, John, it’s Bill Mullaney. First of all, yes, we did have a good sales quarter in Variable Annuities. We had about a $4.5 billion level of sales, which we were very pleased with. It continued to come from a broad range of channels. The traditional channels where we sell Variable Annuities continues to be strong. Rob did mention in his comments the Fidelity relationship, and that has continued to grow and to give us an alternative way to distribute the products. We do look and are in discussions with other potential parties that we would partner with to distribute our VAs through some alternative channels. And as those things get finalized, we'll certainly make you aware of them.
John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And just, I guess, finally on capital, in a sense, have you guys made peace with S&P with the strong quarter and the strong book value growth?
C. Henrikson: We love S&P. Look, I hesitate certainly in public to speak about what S&P thinks. So they’ve put out a research report on us about a month ago, I think. I thought that was a pretty accurate reflection of where they're at. And that's sort of, I would say, our current state of affairs with them.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Colin Devine with Citi.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: One, with respect to what's going on in the U.K., I guess a couple of your more legitimate competitors have pulled out with AXA leaving and AON putting their business up for sale. Is there any sort of update on your thoughts on the U.K. pension market and where you're at? Second, I didn't catch what you said the sales were for the Variable Annuities through Fidelity. If you could just give a sense of that, it would be very helpful. And then also with respect to, I guess, your two other things at International; your ongoing discussions, I guess, with Matsui [ph] and where you stand on the JV [joint venture], if that is no longer going to be a JV. And can you give us any update on your negotiations with Japanese regulators to start taking capital out of ALICO early next year instead of having to wait till 2012?
William Mullaney: It's Bill Mullaney. I'll talk about the first two parts of your question. As it relates to the U.K. closeout business, we have lower U.K. closeout sales out sales this quarter than we had in the first quarter. As we talked about in the past, closeout sales are lumpy. And they do vary from quarter to quarter, so I think you're seeing the effect of that. In addition though, I do think the low-interest rate environment, in particular, is having an impact on the closeout market in both the U.S. and the U.K. I think companies that would be thinking about transferring their pension plans to us are moving more slowly here because of the fact that interest rates are so low. And so I think that will continue to provide a challenge in that business until we see some improvement in the interest rate and the longer-term interest rate environment. So I think that's how we're thinking about the U.K. and the U.S. closeout market. In terms of the Fidelity relationship, you didn't hear the sales number because I didn't say what it was. And because it is a relationship that we have with another company, we don't disclose that publicly. But it has become an important part of the overall sales story. But I will tell you it represents less than 10% of our total VA sales.
William Toppeta: Just on the Japan JV, we are in the discussions with Mitsui Sumitomo. I would say that the discussions are very positive and moving along well. We don't have any conclusion yet. And as soon as we do, you'll be the first to know.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: Okay. And then what’s your spec to Japanese regulations?
William Toppeta: I'm going to get back to Mr. Wheeler.
William Wheeler: With the Japanese, obviously, we explained when we announced ALICO that under sort of the general rules, we thought we wouldn't be able to take out regular dividends out of Japan until sort of the 2012 time frame. It's quite possible that we may get some flexibility on that from the regulator. We haven't really brought that up in great detail with them yet because we've obviously been doing some other things with them about discussing other issues with them at the moment. But I'm hopeful that we might make some progress on that front earlier. But there's nothing definitive to say now.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: Okay, and then just a quick one for Rob, you haven't said anything about the New York Attorney General investigation. I can't believe you're going to let that pass without some comment. So perhaps you can update us on your thinking about that.
C. Henrikson: I just lost a bet. I thought maybe somebody would let it go through and not mention it at all. But then I forgot who was involved. In the first place, I can't really say anything specifically about the Attorney General because even though we’ve read in the press, just like everyone else, about the sort of subpoena activity, we haven't seen anything nor we've talked to anybody from the Attorney General's office. So I really can’t comment.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: Have you received it actually?
C. Henrikson: Not to my knowledge. Why? Do you have some other information? No, we have not received it. And I would comment just generally. Obviously, we strongly disagree with the misleading and incorrect statements, certainly the initial statements coming from the press. Subsequent to that, of course, those with correct knowledge of the situation, including the National Organization of Life Guaranty Association, the NAIC, the ACLI, we and other insurance companies have provided a lot of well-written clarifications. And I would say that certainly most of you on the call have made very clear that you understand how the accounts function. And I think you’ve provided a real public service, quite frankly, for putting together reports that demonstrate very ably your understanding of these. And I think that as more comes to light, that that's the direction things will go. I mean the beneficiaries have full access to their funds. They are in guaranteed minimum interest rates. They exceed what they could in other money market type accounts. Our account holders tell us they love it. It's consumer friendly, on and on. One of the interesting things, as you probably know, in terms of guarantee funds and whatnot, in the course of business, we actually are prohibited from talking about guarantee funds and whatnot in the insurance industry. I think that has to do with moral hazard issues and so forth, which we certainly wouldn't disagree with. By the way, you may recall back in 2008, during the crisis, they clarified the Guaranty Association coverage, which in this instance goes as if it were any kind of life insurance death benefit. And most states in the U.S., all 50 have coverage. Most are at 300,000. A handful, like New York, are at 500,000. None of them are below 250,000. So now I can say that because I'm just commenting on a comment from the guaranty fund association. They came out with a reaffirmation of that just this week. So I think there's nothing better than having good solid clarifying correct information when it comes to financial products. So that's about all I have to say, but I can't say anything about the Attorney General's office.
Colin Devine - Citigroup Inc: Okay, thanks. I think Bill said in the past they have about $3 billion in those accounts. Is that still the right number?
C. Henrikson: No, there was a report. It's north of that. I don't have the exact figure in my head, but it's north of $3 billion.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan.
Jamminder Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just to clarify on the previous question, I think isn't the amount close to $10 billion in those accounts, Bill?
C. Henrikson: Yes, it's something like $10 billion.
Jamminder Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I had a couple of questions. One is on disability claims. Obviously, your margins held up fairly well. A few other companies have reported an uptick in claims. It seems like there is a business mix issue. But what's the possibility that if the economy stays the way it is that you actually see another uptick in claims over the next few quarters? And then the second question is on interest rates. With rates like 10-year sitting around 3%, could you maybe quantify a little bit on if that 10-year stays at this level for the rest of the year, how much of an impact it would have on your earnings and maybe even if it were to drop another 50 basis points, what sort of sensitivity would you have on your results?
William Mullaney: It’s Bill Mullaney. I'll start off by talking about what we’re seeing in disability. As Bill Wheeler talked about in his opening remarks, we saw modest improvement this quarter in disability results relative to prior quarters. Incidence was down slightly. Recoveries were up, improved slightly. And so that's brought the loss ratio down a little bit. You commented on what some of our competitors are seeing. I can't really speak for them. And I'm not really sure why we saw the impact on our disability business more quickly. As you know, we've been talking about this issue for some time. Some of it may have to do with the mix of business that we have. We have a book of business that focuses on large companies. It's also got a significant percentage of those being financial services companies. And I think when the economy started to turn down, I think those companies acted more quickly in terms of adjusting their workforces. That may have had some impact on how quickly we saw claims coming into our operation. We also have taken some price increases over the last couple of pricing cycles, and I think that has helped us in terms of our overall results for the quarter. But what I would say just to summarize is that the performance of the quarter in disability was moderately encouraging. And I would say as the economy continues to slowly recover, we think that will begin to see a recovery in our disability business as well.
C. Henrikson: And Jimmy, with regard to interest rates, we have on a sensitivity or done a little projection, I guess, is by saying if sort of the interest rate environment that we're in now, sort of the 10-year roughly at 3% sort of continues for the rest of this year and through 2011, what would happen to our results? And I guess I would say, the answer is not much in general. By that I mean we would probably see a little lower earnings than otherwise expected in 2011. But it'd be enough to mention but not that significant. I think some people have talked about impairments of DAC or goodwill or things like that, and I wouldn't think that, that's likely in this sort of time frame. You also mentioned drop, and what would happen if we dropped the 10-year to 2 1/2%. I have to admit I haven't run that scenario. So I can't give you any real precise answer. But I would give you sort of a general response. You followed us, and I think most of the analysts listening to this call followed us for a long time. We’ve talked about the low interest rate issues and what we do to protect ourselves. And we've said that from time to time well before obviously the current situation. Because this is part of our risk management, we've often talked about a Japan scenario and how we protect ourselves against that risk. And we buy very long interest-rate floors, sometimes with deferred-start mechanisms to push out -- protect ourselves as long as we can. And we have a pretty good portfolio of those. So as interest rates continue down here, those things obviously come into the money and start paying. But honestly, they're increasing in value as we speak. Or obviously, even in the second quarter, we saw an increase in value of those contracts. So this is something we've thought about for a long time and have, I think, prepared ourselves pretty well for and spent the money, frankly, over the last five years to do. So I think that's being smart about risk management, understanding where your real risks are. So I think we're in relatively good shape here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne Agee.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Any update on the timing for when you guys might file those pro forma historical financials that show Met and ALICO on a combined basis?
C. Henrikson: No, there's no update yet. Well, I'm not actually sure when AIG actually announces earnings for the second quarter. But I should probably know the answer to that. But there's no update yet.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Okay, so sometime after hedge reports?
C. Henrikson: Well, I said there's no update yet.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: All right. So here's my bigger picture question for you. I mean your capital levels continue to grow. The investment portfolio is clearly recovering, showing good strength, very manageable credit-related investment losses and impairments. I guess I'm just curious as to whether we should expect the mix of your financing for ALICO to maybe shift a bit from your original expectations when you announced that deal?
C. Henrikson: I think probably the prudent thing for me to say is you'll just have to wait and see. Obviously, this has been a source of considerable discussion for us, and we obviously wanted to see how, we wanted to go through this quarter. And, obviously, we'll have to just see, I think, is the only answer I can really give.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Sanford Bernstein.
Suneet Kamath - Bernstein Research: In terms of some of the normalization adjustments that we talked about last night, in particular, I'm not used to backing up positive earnings in quarters when the equity markets are down. And obviously that was part of last night's drill. So as it relates to kind of thinking about Met's exposure to equity markets especially considering some of the hedges, would you consider the second quarter to be particularly abnormal in that you actually did well as markets came down because of some phenomenon in terms of how the markets traded in the second quarter? Or are you at a point where you're so over-hedged right now that to the extent that markets recover in the third quarter, we might actually see a little bit of earnings pressure because the hedges would underperform? That's question number one. Question number two is, I guess Met's been fairly involved in the FASB-IASB joint accounting project. I think you and your team, Bill, have talked to them about some of the industry’s issues and concerns there. Any update in terms of where we are and what things might look like as we progress through the year?
C. Henrikson: With regard to the second quarter phenomenon of that positive earnings adjustment, we had an interesting situation this quarter. And I'm not sure we've completely diagnosed why it came about because I think it is sort of unique. You had a pretty substantial drop in both equity and interest rates right at the end of the quarter. And so for most of the quarter, we were a little un-level, and then we had a pretty big drop near the end or in June. And the way GAAP works and when it reflects those sort of macro events, to put it simply, there are sometimes GAAP sort of smooth results with some things like mean reversion formulas and such. And this is one of those occasions where it ended up being a fairly big smoothing. At the same time, our hedging program, which we use to protect against these sort of events, doesn't smooth anything. And so effectively, we became over-hedged at least on an accounting basis, certainly not on an economic risk basis. I think that we feel hedging worked quite well there. And it was meaningful enough that obviously we felt we really had to call it out in the financials and talk about it because it represented roughly a nickel overall for the company of earnings per share. So now the interesting question is – so that’s sort of what happened. What happens if we get a reversal? It doesn’t magically go the other way, and there’s been a $0.05 adjustment going the other way. It doesn't work that simply. I do think that these things do balance out over time because, of course, that's the whole point of mean reversion, it's a smoothing mechanism that will spread out the adjustment over a longer period of time as much as, frankly, five years. So that's how the mean reversion works. So it also has to do with the fact that we are very much in the middle of the mean reversion corridor as opposed to being one end or the other which is good to be in the middle. But I think that, that sort of has a smoothing impact. So you could smooth a little bit the other way. But I think, obviously, if the stock market goes up that we would live with a little smoothing. That's okay. Now, with regard to accounting, I’m going to introduce Pete Carlson who is our Chief Accounting Officer. I remember what he told me yesterday about what was going on, but rather than me just trying to repeat it, maybe I'll let him speak and talk a little bit about what’s going on with these accounting initiatives.
Peter Carlson: Thanks, Bill. Suneet, I think you referenced the Insurance Contracts Project that’s a joint project between the International Accounting Board and the U.S. board, the FASB. What’s happened, the International Board actually overnight did release an exposure draft. They had a July 30th goal, and they’ve released their exposure draft for this project. That would apply to people under International financial reporting standards which obviously is not what we currently follow. The U.S. board, because there already are existing standards for insurance contracts, we have much more industry specific guidance here in the U.S. actually is on a little bit slower path and is not expected to release an exposure draft for another month or two and actually may not even do it an exposure draft. So the stage of the discussions are much more preliminary on the U.S. side. That being said, the boards have recently in discussions, reached a general consensus between both boards that acquisition costs actually would be considered in cash flow. So there would be some deferral of acquisition cost. And that's been one of the two key issues we’ve been monitoring as an industry.
Suneet Kamath - Bernstein Research: The bigger issue at least for me is marking the market of liability, which I think can cause your earnings to swing around pretty dramatically for a noneconomic reason. Is that still kind of where their heads are? Or has there been enough communication with investors? Or perhaps they're taking another look at whether or not that makes sense in terms of improving transparency? Any thoughts on that would be helpful.
C. Henrikson: Yes. I’m pretty sure this IFRS insurance contracts exposure draft is going to include some mark-to-market of liabilities. The key is not whether or not they're going to do that, it's how they do it and the kind of discount rates they use. There was some discussions that they might consider using a risk-free rate. We think that would be a bad idea. We think that the discount rate should really mimic as closely as possible sort of what’s going on with spreads or the mark-to-market of the assets. So you have them. So ergo, if you're a well-matched company, which we think we are and others that, that would minimize the volatility of marking both sides to the balance sheet together. I think they're a lot more aware of that than they used to be. There's this whole interplay between what goes on in AOCI and the movements there and also net income versus operating income. And I think those sort of distinctions, a lot of I think the mark-to-market AOCI, as opposed to obviously including now liabilities is not going to just flow through a real income statement. But looking at operating income and being able to call that out is just only going to get more important as opposed to sort of the mark-to-market in the balance sheet that goes on every quarter. So I’ll probably confuse newspaper reporters, but I think the analyst community will get it. Also, one last thing on this since we’re on this topic is our expectation is this isn't going to be sort of the law of the land until sort of 2013 or '14. And they have pushed this date back a little bit, so we might not be done pushing it back. So this is quite a ways out before this is going to hit us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from UBS.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: Some of the questions that we just heard. For example, on the net Non-Medical benefits ratio, you had an improved 87.8%. And then I look back to the good old days which are back in '06 and '07, and the ratios were slightly under 85%. So the first question is just, is that what we get back to as things improve, and do you kind of have any time trajectory for that?
William Mullaney: Let me comment on that. First of all, the improvement that we saw in the Non-Medical Health benefits ratio this quarter as Bill mentioned in his comments was primarily driven by Dental. We saw the increase in utilization in Dental claims early in 2009 when we took some steps as part of our 2010 pricing both for new business and renewal pricing to adjust our prices to make sure that they reflected the higher cost of claims. And so I think you're starting to see the impact of those pricing changes working into our financial results. And as a result, the loss ratio in Dental has come down and that is the primary driver of Non-Medical Health benefits loss ratio. And that's one of the reasons why we created the new ratio because the Dental business has grown significantly over the past few years relative to the Disability business. So when you think about comparing the benefit ratio today versus the benefit ratio a few years ago, we have seen a change in the mix of the products that are there with Dental becoming much more significant. And that's one of the reasons why we adjusted that ratio in the first place. We still think that we have some opportunities for us to bring that ratio down as I talked about before. I think the Disability ratios continue to be high, reflecting the downturn in the economy that we are seeing some improvement there. And we haven’t yet seen the full impact of the Dental pricing changes working through into the benefits ratio. So over time, our expectation is that, that ratio will continue to trend down.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: Great color. And just want to give a little [indiscernible] or quantify that?
William Toppeta: I think there’s a number of things that will factor into that including how quickly the economy recovers and how that will impact Disability, so at this time, I don't think I will get any more specific than what I said before.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: Okay, fair enough. And just shifting over to operational excellence, and Bill mentioned an expense ratio of 22.4% and then the low end of, I guess the guidance is 21.8%. Maybe, Bill, I guess you had got an additional $200 million of savings. I think that's all done. And maybe give us a sense of when you could get to that 21.8%.
William Mullaney: In the first quarter, I think we were 21.7%. I think that’s right. So we were right at the bottom of the range. Obviously, it's a ratio, right, so you’ve got to look at the numerator and the denominator. In terms of expense control, we're ahead of our plan. And we’re doing better than our budgets and our plans this year. So we’re very good about that. Of course, what we can't control very well is the denominator which is revenues. And, obviously, what kind of made the ratio go up for this quarter is not because expenses went up; it’s because we had lots of close-out sales which are obviously lumpy. And that smoothes over a year period, but in the short run you can have lumpy quarters like the one we just did. So in terms of real expense control, we put out guidance that we raised our operational excellence guidance to $600 million at Investor Day, 2009, last December. And we're going to exceed that number. I mean it's hard for me to say how much. But as you would hope, a number we put out, we would like to beat. So we're doing very well there. And now, of course, you know that after this year, I think we start shifting our focus onto the ALICO acquisition and taking costs out of there. But I don’t know if we’ll have OpEx 2 necessarily, we're going to continuing to drive expense control around here. I think that's not just holding through ALICO, through the rest of the company. So I think there's more good news there to come in the future.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: That’s interesting. Steve seemed somewhat optimistic about the outlook for commercial real estate. We'd love to hear a little color on just the overall environment for that and where you see that affecting Met’s ratios that you discussed earlier.
Steven Kandarian: We’ve seen at a minimum a bottom out of certain sectors of the commercial real estate market and even a slight improvement. And certainly, there are far more lenders going back into the area right now, and mortgage rates are coming down fairly significantly. So you're seeing activity pick up. You're seeing improving lease operates [ph] and so on of buildings. So I don't want overstate it. I'm not saying that there’ll be other problems coming down the road, because there's always a lag in this sector regarding a borrower who eventually can't pay off a mortgage. But onto the fundamentals of the business, itself, have improved slightly. And I think that where things go from here will be largely driven by what happens in the overall economy. So if we do have a slow recovery here, which I think is our position in terms of the most likely outcome, then you anticipate that the market overall will improve along with the economy. Were we to go into some sort of double-dip, which we're not predicting, then obviously, things could get worse.
C. Henrikson: Andrew, this is Rob. It's hard for me to be quiet on this topic. Steve is absolutely correct in everything he said. I would say, though, that he's reflecting -- because the question is about our portfolio and our mortgage holdings and so forth, I just wouldn't want to hasten to say that our experience is necessarily reflective of the entire marketplace. It hasn't been in the past, and it won't be in the future. And I say that because we have very high-quality properties and extraordinarily strong real estate history and team. And I think he's being a little modest. So I would just put it that way. Don't project that as a proxy to the entire marketplace, which is full of a lot of secondary market problems still and might even trend a little bit worse in some of those markets.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank: So it's a reflection of market quality of properties as opposed to just a general?
C. Henrikson: Exactly.
Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Just interested in any thoughts we can get on Dodd-Frank bill specifically related to Volcker. And then derivatives on Volcker, there was a broad carve-up for the insurance industry. But at least we're still not clear on whether or not your holdings of hedge funds and private equity might be affected. And then just more broadly, kind of how you think derivatives might carry higher costs going forward?
C. Henrikson: Let me sort of provide a little color and commentary, Randy. Last call, and I think the one before that, I talked about, at least it was helpful for me to kind of differentiate thoroughbred racehorses from camels. I made that comment. And at least some of the people down in Washington kind of liked it and said it was actually reflective of what it was all about. So whether or not that's helpful for normal people, I don't know. But it seemed to help people in Washington. Let me just give you a little flavor. I mean as I said all along, the bill passes, and now relative to the insurance companies, the work is far from over which is a good thing, because the bill is full of bank language, full of bank processes and so forth. And so the clarifications then work to differentiate the insurance marketplace. And so it’s literally hundreds of rule-making and regulatory projects that are going on. You have an idea; there are 199 separate rule-making initiatives. There are 68 studies underway. There are 355 issues on which lawmakers have given regulators the authority to issue the regulations even if the regulations are not expressly required. And keep in mind that some of the studies are done by agencies that do not even now currently exist, like the Financial Services Oversight Council, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot of work to be done on the details. And because it is so important to us, other people may think that we would relax a little bit. And this is the time that we really have positioned ourselves, both as a company directly and through the ACLI as a resource to all of these rule-making initiatives and wordings and so forth. And so when it comes to things like – and this covers though Volcker rule, it covers derivatives. It covers things like resolution authority fees, taxes, this and the other. We're all very, very focused and very active here at MetLife in Washington. So that's probably the best way to answer that question because it's very difficult to be more clear than that. But we’re not discouraged. We’re not discouraged. We like this kind of slogging through. That’s kind of what we do very well.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: The Volcker issue is a real issue, right, with the holding?
C. Henrikson: The Volcker issue is interesting because keep in mind where it started. It starts with proprietary accounts. The language in the original proposal did not, of course, contemplate nor think about insurance companies. Therefore, the definition of what a proprietary account was, was not clarified. And, of course, if you left the language alone, it would have given us problems relative to the general account, itself, because if proprietary is everything other than an account owned by an individual, as you know, individuals own contracts and policies with us in the general account. They don't own a specific investment. So that was a starting place. And I'll let Steve comment beyond that.
Steven Kandarian: There is carve-out language in the Volcker rule component of the bill. It's somewhat vague, and there's a six-month study that's been ordered by the bill. But we think that when people really look through the announces here, they’ll realize that for us to invest in private equity funds, for us to invest in hedge funds with the capital requirements that are imposed upon us through our existing regulatory regime certainly still makes sense. So there's certainly no evidence to suggest any problems during this last crisis we went through related to these kinds of investments for insurance companies in their general account, again given the risk-based capital rules that we live under and so on. So my guess is that it will not affect us, but we’ll have to wait to see how the six-month study sorts out. And we’ll certainly be involved in providing input into that process.

Operator: Welcome to the MetLife first quarter earnings release. (Operator Instructions) Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife.  Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time-to-time in MetLife Incorporated's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife Incorporated specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Conor Murphy, Head of Investor Relations. 
Conor Murphy:  Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's first quarter 2010 earnings call. We are delighted to be here this morning to talk with you about our results for the quarter. We will be discussing certain financial measures and updates on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplement both of which are available at Metlife.com.   A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment related gains and losses which can fluctuate from period to period and may have significant impact on GAAP net income.   Joining me this morning are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments we will take your questions. Here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management including Bill Mullaney, President of the U.S. business and Bill Toppeta, President of International and Bill Moore, President of Auto and Home.   With that I would like to turn the call over to Rob.  
Rob Henrikson :  Thank you Conor and good morning everyone. We are off to an excellent start in 2010 delivering strong results across the board. During the first quarter MetLife generated $8.8 billion in premiums in fees and other revenues. That is up 12% over the prior-year period. We grew operating earnings to $834 million. That is up significantly from a year ago and it is up nearly 5% sequentially.  Book values per share improved noticeably in the quarter as well. Book value including AOCI is up 9% sequentially and book value excluding AOCI is up over 2%. The growth we are seeing on the bottom line demonstrates the discipline we have maintained in our underwriting, pricing, risk management and expense controls. We are also benefiting from the more favorable equity markets as they continue to recover. And, as you know, MetLife emerged from the economic crisis financially strong which positions us very well for the solid first quarter performance you will hear about today.  Before we do that let me take a moment to comment on our recent agreement to acquire Alico. As I have said before we expect the acquisition of this highly complementary business will be rewarding to our shareholders and will accelerate our growth strategy. While we can’t comment on Alico’s first quarter financial results, let me highlight some integration progress to date.  There are 30 regional and functional teams comprised of both MetLife and Alico associates dedicated to the integration. We have deployed a rigorous management plan to ensure a seamless transition. In the first few weeks after the announcement our team visited each of Alico’s major locations and met with many employees and approximately 200 senior leaders. We also are designing the optimal enterprise operating model which will fuel the growth of our combined businesses.  Having said that, let me be clear that although the integration is a high priority we will not be distracted from achieving our 2010 plan and we know the same is true at Alico. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business in order to drive growth and shareholder value.  Now turning to some highlights from our businesses. In U.S. business premiums, fees and other revenues increased to $7.4 billion, up 11% over the prior year. This strong result reflects top line growth in corporate benefit funding which more than doubled, retirement products which also increased dramatically and insurance products. Operating earnings were strong across all of U.S. business and at $757 million it represents a substantial increase from the $178 million one year ago.  In our insurance products segment growth in premiums, fees and other revenues was driven primarily by a 6% increase in group life premiums over the first quarter of 2009. Non-medical health revenues were flat. Dental revenues increased but were partially offset by a decline in disability. Individual life premiums, fees and other revenues were also flat over the prior year. However, sales grew 15% driven by increases in whole, term and universal life products. Operating earnings nearly doubled over the prior year period with 92% growth from higher investment income, solid group life underwriting and lower expenses.  In retirement products, better equity market performance and thus higher fee income contributed to strong top line growth of 27%. Fixed annuity sales of almost $360 million are lower than last year’s record levels due to high demand for MetLife’s fixed annuities at the onset of the financial crisis. Variable annuity sales of over $4 billion are up 9% sequentially and 8% over the prior year. Net flows remain strong. Lapse rates continue to decline and the success of our new Fidelity product is contributing to our increased market share. Operating earnings and retirement products were strong at $159 million.  In corporate benefit funding, premiums, fees and other revenues increased 112% over the first quarter of 2009 driven by higher pension closeout activity primarily in the U.K. Structured settlement premiums also continued to drive the excellent top line in corporate benefit funding. Earnings for this segment were up significantly from the prior year.  Finally, within U.S. business auto and home results were solid. Top line growth was consistent with expectations and earnings were steady at $72 million. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was very good at 88.8. MetLife Bank delivered another good quarter. The bank generated revenues of $299 million, down from the unusually high levels in the prior period and consistent with overall market activity. Operating earnings remained healthy at $53 million.  Turning to our international business we achieved another very strong quarter with growth across all three regions. On a reported basis, premiums, fees and other revenues grew 27% over the prior year and operating earnings grew 15%. In Latin America growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil contributed to top line growth of 28%. The Asia Pacific region grew 24% due to higher sales primarily in Hong Kong. In our Europe, Middle East and India region the top line increased by 30% driven by continued growth in India and strong sales in Europe.  We continue to experience excellent top and bottom line growth internationally which is part of the reason why I am so excited about Alico. We can build upon this and leverage the complementary strengths of both companies to accelerate our growth even further.  Steve will talk to you about our investments in a moment. I would like to say though I am very pleased with the overall performance of the portfolio which has returned to a net unrealized gain position. We also had a small net realized gain for the quarter which included impairments of $97 million after tax. So our run rate of credit losses is significantly below our projection of $1 billion for 2010.  Finally, this month MetLife celebrated its 10th anniversary as a publicly traded company. In those 10 years we have become stronger and have significantly accelerated our growth, demonstrated by our consistent delivery of shareholder value. With all that has been accomplished and with what is on the horizon I feel very optimistic about the future. While there are undoubtedly challenges ahead, I believe we have the strategy, leadership and momentum to position MetLife as one of the leading insurance companies in the world.  With that I will turn it over to Steve Kandarian. 
Steve Kandarian :  Thanks Rob. I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter. Overall we continue to see improvement in the markets, rising variable income and lower losses. First, let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pre-tax variable investment income for the first quarter was $314 million which is $114 million above the top of the plan range that I gave at investor day. This was primarily driven by strong private equity and hedge fund returns. While we expect returns to be below this level during the remainder of the year we believe variable income should remain strong.  Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses continued to decline and were $211 million while gross realized gains were $400 million. Write downs also declined and were $149 million. Excluding derivatives we had a net realized investment gain of $40 million this quarter. Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $8.5 billion at March 31st, down from $10.8 billion at December 31 as spread declined across most sectors. Overall the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $1.5 billion at quarter end.  Next I would like to briefly touch upon our commercial mortgage holdings. During the first quarter delinquent loans increased from $8 million to $162 million. This increase resulted from three loans, one of which is expected to be paid off during the second quarter with a loss of no more than $2 million. The second has been restructured and the third is a high quality property we plan to transfer to our real estate equity portfolio. As such, we expect limited losses as recoveries on these loans are projected to be significantly above the historical average of 75%.  As I noted on the last call, we anticipated the delinquencies might increase in 2010 but would be manageable particularly given our commercial mortgage valuation allowance of $624 million. We believe that commercial real estate valuations have bottomed out with an average peak-to-trough decline of about 40%. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio increased slightly in the first quarter to 69% based on a rolling four-quarter valuation process or we estimate to the low to mid 70% range if all properties were revalued today.  Importantly only 2% of our portfolio have a loan-to-value greater than 80% and a debt service to coverage ratio of less than one times. Furthermore, we have seen pick up in office leasing activities compared to last year and hotel occupancies are also starting to improve. In summary, we remain confident our commercial mortgage portfolio will outperform the overall market and that loss levels will likely remain low.  Finally, given the recent headlines I would like to make a brief comment on MetLife’s exposure to Europe’s perimeter regions. As I mentioned in March when we announced our pending Alico transaction, MetLife’s general account has less than $40 million of total sovereign debt exposure to Italy, Ireland, Spain and Greece combined and we have no exposure to Portugal. These are countries in which we do very little business.  Alico holds approximately $1.3 billion in Greek sovereign debt and their Greek bank holdings are diminimous. Remember, when the transaction closes these assets will transfer at market value to our GAAP financials. On a statutory basis Alico must be delivered with a 400% RBC ratio. While we are closely monitoring the impact of any country’s specific situation, we continue to believe that Alico’s portfolio is of relatively high quality with manageable loss expectations.  With that I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler. 
Bill Wheeler :  Thanks Steve. Good morning everyone. MetLife reported $1.01 of operating earnings per share for the first quarter. As Rob mentioned this strong bottom line result represents solid business growth, higher investment income, improved equity markets and the results of our expense management efforts. This morning I will walk through our financial results and point out some highlights as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter.  Let’s begin with premiums, fees and other revenues. Total premiums, fees and other revenues which were $8.8 billion in the first quarter are up 12% from the first quarter of last year and 10% on a constant currency basis. U.S. business premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.4 billion reflect an 11% increase over the prior year. This includes a 27% increase in retirement products revenue due to increases in fees from positive net flows and higher separate account investment returns.  Also revenue growth in corporate benefit funding is up over 100% from the prior-year quarter driven by strong structured settlements and U.K. closeout sales. As we have noted before, closeout sales do fluctuate and cannot be expected to occur at the same level each quarter. Internationally revenues are up 27% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis over the prior-year quarter driven by growth in all three regions.  Turning to our operating margin let’s start with our underwriting results. In U.S. business our mortality results were mixed this quarter. The group life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89.5% versus our estimated range of 90-95% which is an excellent result. Our individual life mortality ratio for the quarter was 87.6% which is slightly below our plan. At 91.2% for the quarter the non-medical health total benefits ratio is up from 87.4% in the prior-year quarter. While we continue to see signs of stabilization in dental utilization we did experience higher claims activity. Disability margins are also weaker due to higher incidents and lower claim recoveries.  Turning to our auto and home business the combined ratio including catastrophes was 94.1% for the first quarter which is up over the prior year’s quarter results of 92.4% due to higher catastrophes and less prior year reserve releases. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 88.8% in the first quarter versus 88.1% in the prior year period. A non-catastrophe prior-accident year reserve release of $5 million after tax was taken in this quarter compared to a $17 million after-tax release in the prior-year period.  Moving to investment spreads. We saw an improvement in investment spreads this quarter with the improvement in the market and variable investment income results. For the quarter, variable investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $71 million or $0.09 per share above the top of the 2010 quarterly guidance range given at investor day. As Steve explained this was primarily driven by strong private equity and hedge fund returns.  Moving to expenses our operational excellence initiative continues to prove successful. Additionally, pension costs have stabilized and are no longer causing a significant impact year-over-year. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 21.7%, a solid result and below the 2010 guidance of 21.8-22.5% given at investor day. This quarter we did incur a $20 million after-tax or $0.02 per share in operational excellence charges and certain other one-time items.  Turning to our bottom line results we earned $834 million in operating earnings or $1.01 per share. Included in our first quarter results is a one-time tax charge of $75 million or $0.09 per share related to the tax law change for Medicare Part D subsidy embedded in the recently enacted Healthcare reform legislation as well as a $13 million or $0.02 impact due to the expiration of certain business tax incentives for controlled foreign corporations.  With regard to investment gains and losses, in the first quarter we had after-tax net realized investment gains of $2 million which includes derivative losses of $19 million after-tax. MetLife uses derivatives to hedge a number of risks. Changes in the value of these derivatives are in general offset on an economic basis across various assets and liabilities. Impairments were $97 million after-tax in the first quarter which is a 50% decline from the fourth quarter of 2009.  Our preliminary statutory operating earnings for the first quarter of 2010 are approximately $580 million and our preliminary statutory net income is $660 million. Finally, cash and liquid assets at the holding company at quarter end were $3.8 billion.  In summary, MetLife had a very good first quarter. Our revenue growth is strong. Our investment performance has improved and our earnings continue to grow.  With that I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein. 
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: On the Alico deal, with respect to the 400% minimum RBC at close guarantee, are there any stipulations in the contract in terms of how Alico gets to 400%? In other words if something happened that forces them below does that [take] a capital infusion by AIG or can they do something else such as slow growth or take offsetting realized gains? Any color on that would be helpful. 
Bill Wheeler :  There isn’t a stipulation about how they solve the 400. If you know how RBC is calculated and how complex a calculation it is it is not the thing you can kind of manage two quarters ahead of time by slowing growth. My expectation is that if…by the way and I think I have said this in a number of forums, absent investment losses this year my expectation is that Alico’s RBC will be well above 400. So they are going to have some cushion. If there are investment losses between now and when we close, by the way our expectation is we are six months away from closing. If they have investment losses they have some cushion to probably solve that problem. My guess is capital infusion will not be necessary. 
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: I guess their ownership stake in Met is a pretty good incentive not to do anything too tricky there. The second question is on derivatives legislation. I know it is early days here but I am assuming you are in touch with the folks in Washington about what might happen there. Can you at a high level give us some thoughts in terms of what we should be looking for and what we might expect the impact on Met to be? 
Rob Henrikson :  In terms of being in touch let me start out there. We both as a company and as an industry leader we are very in touch continuously with people on the hill and people in the agencies and so forth. I will be a little more philosophical about this than you might want but it would be hard to be more specific. Everybody recognizes, and I mean everyone, that closing regulatory gaps to avoid future crisis is an objective.  If we had all started out with a blank sheet of paper and said let’s identify the challenges and the objectives and from that we will glean language and that language will be efficient, elegant and clear relative to reform one would have envisioned a race horse; something very elegant. In fact, we knew that was not possible a long time ago. So you have realistically given the charged political climate and so forth people have been working on constructing a camel now for some time. If you know anything about camels you can construct one and it may look a little funny and it may not look particularly elegant but it gets you there.  So we in the industry are working to make sure the Camel gets us where we want to go and it doesn’t spit, bite and kick. So that is sort of the philosophical answer and it is a good one relative to where discussions are. Quite frankly, most everyone in the debate recognizes the business of insurance needs to be protected from unintended consequences on bank regulations and we are pretty optimistic the debate is proceeding pretty nicely actually despite the turmoil we see in the press. We don’t think it is going to have too much adverse effect on the insurance industry. So that is a prognostication. Tune in. 
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: While the racehorse/camel analogy will probably live on for awhile, Warren Buffet I guess is trying to get some rules changed or some sort of exception around how much capital or collateral you would have to post. Is that something that will impact you in terms of how you manage the business? Any thoughts there would be helpful. 
Rob Henrikson :  I think it may impact others much more than it would us. Remember in terms of derivative use and what not being regulated we have a derivatives use plan that has to be approved by the regulator. We are collateralized in that activity. So the idea of a carve out for the insurance companies is probably not going to happen but to carve out around specific insurance activities and how you measure that both on the liability and the asset side most likely will be the result.  Rather than start out totally clean with some exceptions we will start out with the other end of the spectrum and then back out the business of insurance that needs to be protected. So that is kind of the flavor of what is going on at present. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar – JP Morgan. 
Jimmy Bhullar – JP Morgan : On your spreads, obviously very strong across the board this quarter. I think part of the reason is [inaudible] income but you have been deploying excess liquidity as well. Maybe you can give us numbers on where your liquidity position stood at the end of the quarter and whether you intended to reduce that this quarter as well. Secondly, on disability losses or non-medical loss ratio, your disability losses seem like they are picking up, not a lot, but they are picking up as the economy has gotten worse. That is a little different than what the results have been for some of the other disability companies which have shown relatively stable margins. If you could give some detail on whether it is incident rates picking up or the recoveries not being that great? Finally, a numbers question since there were questions on Alico before, what was the RBC of Alico when the deal was announced so we can get an idea of how much they can absorb in terms of losses before having to put in more capital? 
Steve Kandarian :  I will take the one on us reinvesting some cash which we have done over the last couple of quarters. Our cash is down over $5 billion since the third quarter. Those funds have been invested in a broad array of normal assets and asset sectors we typically invest in. It has been kind of across the board in various different sectors. We have seen spreads tighten in a little bit more recently. We have taken advantage earlier on in terms of some higher spread assets we thought had very good risk/reward tradeoffs. That obviously that has helped our yields here and our spreads. 
Bill Mullaney :  On disability I think what is happening in disability is really a result of macroeconomic trends. We have been seeing the disability loss ratio pick up really for a good part of 2009. It is actually down a little bit over where it was in the fourth quarter. It is driven by a few things. The primary thing that is driving the loss ratio is recoveries and getting people back to work. Our level of recoveries is significantly below where we would expect it to be and that is having a big impact on the loss ratio.  Incidents is up a little bit but it is not a lot. We had anticipated we were going to see this as the economy started to soften. We have been raising prices on the disability business. That is one of the reasons why non-medical health revenue was a little bit depressed because disability sales have been below what we would have expected if we hadn’t been taking the price increases. It is something we have been watching for awhile. We continue to manage it aggressively and we think the numbers will start to improve as the unemployment rate begins to come down. 
Jimmy Bhullar – JP Morgan : Have dental claims been picking up as well or have they stabilized? 
Bill Mullaney :  We saw a pretty big spike in dental claims starting in the first quarter of 2009 which went through pretty much the rest of 2009. 2010 is better than the increase we saw in 2009 but it is still a little bit elevated over where we would have expected it to be. Again we were pretty aggressive on pricing actions in dental. We re-price most of those contracts either every year or every other year. So we took some pricing actions in 2010. That is bringing the dental loss ratio down. The way I would characterize dental is I would say the claim activity there is stabilizing and we expect over time it is going to improve. 
Bill Wheeler :  Finally on Alico’s RBC ratio. You know Alico doesn’t actually, you probably know this, but Alico doesn’t actually publish an RBC ratio. That is kind of a unique statutory filing. So it is not a number in the public domain. 
Jimmy Bhullar – JP Morgan : That’s why I was asking. 
Bill Wheeler :  Think a number of approximately 400 RBC ratio. 
Jimmy Bhullar – JP Morgan : So the pluses and minuses obviously the earnings accrue to that and that goes up and then you have investment losses and whatever other changes right? 
Bill Wheeler :  Exactly.   
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally – Morgan Stanley. 
Nigel Dally – Morgan Stanley: A question on the expense ratio this quarter. It came in very robust near the low end of your guidance range provided at investor day. How sustainable is that likely to be and what level of incremental expense save do you still have from the operational excellence initiatives yet to come? 
Bill Wheeler :  The 21.7 is slightly below the target range in our plan. I think our target range was 21.8-22.3% and so we are trending a little bit better than plan. I will also tell you the 21.7 if anything, what drove the number. Revenues were better than forecast so that obviously helps the number look better but we also had some one-time negative expenses which were obviously not planned for. I don’t know if those quite cancel each other out but they are probably close. I actually think it is quite sustainable though it is a little bit below plan but it is certainly within the reasonable range.  How much more room do we have? As you know we put out an original operational expense reduction target of $400 million. We upped it to $600 million last December and we said we would be sort of at a $600 million run rate by the end of this year. We are clearly on track to do that. We feel very comfortable about that number. So that is probably all I can say today. 
Nigel Dally – Morgan Stanley: There has been various [inaudible] out there by the regulators with regards to required capital gains commission mortgage [lends]. Have you done any calculations as to how that has impacted you with [respect to capital]?
Bill Wheeler :  That jumbled a little bit. Were you talking about the proposed increases to the capital for commercial mortgages? Is that right? 
Nigel Dally – Morgan Stanley: That’s right and what impact that would have on your RBC ratio. 
Bill Wheeler : There has been some speculation the NAIC, well certainly there are some discussions among NAIC members…by the way that is different than being an initiative of the NAIC. Everybody needs to appreciate that. They may raise the capital requirements for commercial mortgages. I think the current number is 2.6% and the idea was it would go to 4% but depending on how your portfolio was performing it could be anywhere from 3-5%.  Interestingly, since I think our performance of the commercial mortgage portfolio will be at the positive end, it is possible depending on how wide that band ultimately is between 3-5% and how low it dips, the honest truth is even if this passed it might have a very, very modest effect on our RBC ratio. I think if you took the midpoint of the range and said 4% it is I think Moody’s put out a piece which estimated the impact on us would be like 25 RBC points. I actually think we are obviously very close to what goes on in the NAIC and I think we have to wait and see how that initiative lands but I think we feel pretty good that is probably not going to be the final result of the capital requirements for commercial mortgages. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher – Credit Suisse. 
Tom Gallagher – Credit Suisse: I know one of the rating agencies has been talking about, and I think has you on negative watch, and is suggesting they would like to see more capital pro forma the Alico deal. Can you give us an update on where you stand in terms of overall capital adequacy relative to balancing out the rating situation? Second, I notice you had a $160 million increase in net investment income for fixed maturity securities and the actual annualized yield went up by 14 basis points. That compares to 4Q into 1Q. Just curious what is driving that? What kind of new money yields you are seeing for bonds? Is it possible that you can keep that steady or are you investing for where you are and might we see a drag there? 
Bill Wheeler :  With regard to the capital situation as opposed to sort of aiming this at a rating agency let me just sort of give you a synopsis of where we are. We ended up 2009 with a 432% consolidated RBC ratio. That is the highest RBC ratio this company has ever had frankly by quite a ways. On top of that we had $3.8 billion of cash. So fast forward a quarter and while we had very good statutory earnings on a stat basis a realized investment gain and the cash position at the holding company hasn’t changed.  So in many ways I think our capital position is frankly as strong as it has ever been. I don’t think the risk profile of the company has changed on whit frankly. Certainly we feel like we are properly capitalized and we have a very nice capital cushion currently. Now, the rating agencies obviously are concerned about the industry and about asset problems and certain categories especially the real estate business and commercial mortgages. I think we have spent a lot of air time discussing the high quality of our commercial mortgage portfolio, about how differentiated it really is. That is not just us talking. Remember the federal government stress test a year ago right about this time. The 19 large financial institutions of this country we were the only insurance company in that group. Our results of their stress test in our commercial mortgage portfolio is we had the highest performing portfolio. It wasn’t really close.  We feel we are in very good shape. But I think we are at a point in time I think in the economic cycle where we have gone through a crisis. We have gone through the fire. A lot of people are very nervous. I think as the months tick by and our results are good and the market environment is getting better I think people will feel better. I don’t know the answer is we should be stockpiling more capital but we will continue to monitor it and we will obviously continue to have discussions with the rating agencies to make sure we would like to persuade them of our position.  So that is my general feeling on capital. With regard to financing for Alico, I think we have said this before. We do need to raise some external capital. We said when we announced this transaction we expected to raise $2 billion of common and that we expected to do that publicly or privately and if we did it publicly we would be in a position to do it sometime this summer. None of that has changed. The only thing that has changed is I think when we made that announcement the stock was at $38 and I think it closed yesterday at $45 and change.  So obviously we don’t have to sell quite as many shares. We probably wouldn’t have to sell quite as many shares as we originally had modeled. So that is sort of where we stand. 
Steve Kandarian : I would say two factors are driving the increase. One is the reinvestment of about $1.3 billion of cash in the quarter. The second thing is we have some inflation linked assets in Latin America and due to some accounting quirks, if you will, that resulted in some more positive net investment income that shows up in that line item. There is an offset though on the liability side so you might see that elsewhere in the financial statements. So bottom line is you wouldn’t necessarily expect that number to trend up given current yields and spreads in the marketplace. 
Tom Gallagher – Credit Suisse: What kind of yields are you seeing in terms of new money as it relates to just fixed income portfolio? 
Steve Kandarian :  It is around 5% right now for fixed income. Obviously that varies based upon whether you are buying floating rate assets and matching up against floating rate liabilities or buying longer assets and matching up against our longer liabilities. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Colin Devine – Citigroup. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: On pension quotas obviously some [chunk] sales this quarter but as you noted they were coming out of the U.K. I am starting to hear there is maybe a couple of large deals being worked on in the U.S. and I’m not sure if Rob you want to comment on that but maybe we will get something out of you on it. Even as Bill mentioned with your own pension its funding situation is stabilized. Are we starting to see the domestic pension closeout market warm up? Secondly, with respect to the legislative development I guess there is also some chatter out of Washington that we may see some favorable tax treatment change on annuities specifically encouraging people to annuitize. If you could perhaps comment on that? Then with respect to the comments you made earlier with the NAIC change to the commercial mortgage charge is that really all that important? I would assume it is really the rating agencies the charge on commercial mortgages that is ruling the day here. Perhaps you could compare the figures you put up for where the NAIC charge or capital charge may go on mortgages for what you are holding now under the various rating agency models? 
Bill Mullaney :  Let me start by talking about closeouts. We did have a very strong quarter in pension closeouts particularly in the U.K. The U.K. market has changed quite a bit over the last couple of years. A number of the competitors that were very aggressive in terms of pricing closeouts back in 2007 and 2008 have pulled back out of the market. There is still quite a bit of closeout activity and as a result we are writing a fair amount of business and we are writing it at good returns.  In terms of what is happening in the U.S. I think your observations are right. The market is starting to open up a little bit. I think as the equity markets have recovered and funding status of the pension plans has improved there are more deals to be done. I would say some of the deals that are currently close to being resolved are on the smaller end in terms of size. Having said that there are some bigger deals and there are conversations that have been taking place over a number of months with some larger plan sponsors about potential closeout activity there. So we will see how that ultimately develops. 
Rob Henrikson :  Relative to tax changes a broad answer is obviously there is a thirst for revenue from the federal government. Everyone is working very hard relative to making sure that tax increases at least are consistent with what the overall focus is. For example, driven by both the Department of Labor and the Treasury Department at the moment there is quite a bit of focus on the need for securing more retirement income. That is work being done by DOL and the Treasury, not driven by the life industry. So one might presume it would be counter to exactly what the focus is to turn around and focus on taxes out of annuities.  Who knows. That is across almost any kind of business activity in the United States. Everybody is hunkering down and making sure there are not unintended consequences about revenue gathering. I wish I could be more specific but obviously again both we are a company and we as a leader in the industry are very involved in these dialogues. 
Bill Wheeler :  With regard to your question about commercial mortgages and the capital we hold I guess your point was it is really not so much about what the RBC impact is. It is really about what the rating agencies think we should be holding for capital against those asset classes and how that may or may not change. Is that kind of the gist of it? 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: I think that is fair. 
Bill Wheeler :  Moody’s just put out a piece recently and they were pretty explicit. They said the proposed NAIC change is probably consistent with our base case in terms of losses we expect over the next three years for the industry. But they said the fact that this doesn’t really change our view because obviously we already had a view about investment losses. They did say that in a stress scenario the losses could be significantly larger. I think that is kind of the point. S&P I don’t think they have put out the same sort of piece. I think it is messaging the same thing. They feel in a stress scenario the losses in the commercial sector could be significantly larger and therefore people need to hold even more capital to be able to stress scenario.  This is sort of about an economic capital, third sigma event or fourth sigma event or whatever you want to call it. A tail event. It is interesting. We obviously build our own economic capital models and I think have done a lot of really good work. One thing we have sort of learned is tail events are very, very hard and the world has also learned over the last few years that tail events are very hard to predict. How much capital or what the losses are likely to be in a tail event are difficult. It is really more art than science. This is maybe if you want to think about it is sort of the dispute we are sort of having with the rating agencies right now.  It is sort of what capital is really appropriate for a tail event. I don’t know if there is any obvious answer to that. I guess I sort of think a couple of things. One, I don’t think there is any doubt the quality of our commercial portfolio is at one end of the spectrum both in this industry and just in general to that asset class. It is high quality. The way that portfolio was built over many years was not an effort to chase yield. It was an effort to diversify against corporate credit risk. I think anybody who has looked at those properties or understands the mortgage portfolio would readily agree with us it is very high quality and the statistics we get kind of back that up.  So what may happen to the industry I don’t think is necessarily indicative of what may happen to us. Then I think it becomes a kind of a theoretical debate about what capital levels should be to deal with a stress test environment. That is sort of an interesting risk policy kind of decision. I think we are in a very good spot in terms of how we look at it. That is sort of why we are holding the capital we are today. I know I am giving kind of a long winded rant here but you are right it isn’t just necessarily about what is the immediate RBC impact. It really has more to do with what theoretically should be the ultimate level of capital held against that asset class. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: On the pension closeouts in the U.S. there may be some big ones. You have always talked about that as being analogous potentially to an M&A deal. Do you have enough capital available right now post Alico that you can really be a player if we start to see closeouts in the U.S.? 
Bill Wheeler :  Certainly. Just think about it, first of all it depends on the size. How big are we really talking here? 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: I am hearing big. 
Bill Wheeler :  I think there are certainly pension plans that are out there that are big enough that probably it might require additional capital. So I couldn’t say in all cases we would have enough but certainly we have enough for any reasonable level of activity. Remember this becomes a capital allocation decision. Even though we are not back to full earnings power we are going to generate good earnings this year and we are going to generate excess capital this year. Then the question becomes where does that get redeployed. If business is good enough and we are seeing a lot of well priced pension closeout business that is where it is going to get redeployed to because that is a great growth initiative. Just like any growth initiative. If there is no big growth initiative it will get redeployed in another manner. That is the kind of decision we make every day. 
Rob Henrikson :  I would make the observation that our discussion over the last few minutes in the absolute jumbo market clearly that both the buyer and the seller understand the dynamics of everything we have just discussed. That is just a comment I would make and there again I would make the analogy to the M&A business. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of John Hall – Wells Fargo. 
John Hall – Wells Fargo : When you mentioned the exposure to Greece you didn’t really mention any of the other perimeter countries. I was wondering if you could give us an idea of where we stand there. Then secondly, you talked about the 400% RBC floor. Does Alico really need a 400% RBC really to operate? I guess the question is if you get it at 400 RBC are you going to be getting a company that is effectively over-capitalized given the mix of business it has? 
Rob Henrikson :  I will start. We have to be a little careful in terms of what we put out because these are Alico numbers and I will simply point you to the stat filing Schedule D for them. If you look at the other perimeter countries in total if you look at the schedule D you will see that their sovereign exposure to Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain equal in aggregate about what they have to Greece in rough numbers. That will give you some direction in terms of their holdings. 
Bill Wheeler :  With regard to Alico’s 400% RBC, here is a good way to answer that. For MetLife overall we have said we have a bright line we need to be above 350. I think that means 350 plus a cushion and I think the debate is therefore about the size of the cushion. By the way Moody’s I think still says 350 is what is necessary to be a AA company in normal times at least. I wouldn’t think there is anything about Alico which would make me change that policy.  I start with the idea of what is good for MetLife is certainly good for Alico and so 350 plus is going to make sense. 400 I would not expect we would need to actually manage Alico to an RBC of 400 but it is 350 plus a cushion which might get you close to 400. Clearly the capital requirements in most of these foreign operations are not as tough as they are in the U.S. or what would really be required in the U.S. So if anything the bias is the other direction. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach.
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: With respect to Alico I think when you announced the deal one of the things you highlighted was the improved perception I guess of Alico with met behind it especially within the bank distribution channel in Japan. I know it has been a relatively short period of time but I was hoping you could give us an update on whether you are seeing any real evidence of that in the sales or surrender activity in the bank channel in Japan from Alico? 
Bill Toppeta :  I really don’t want to front-run any announcements that AIG is going to make including Alico performance. I think I would prefer to defer on that question until after they have made their announcement. 
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: Can you answer yes or no? 
Bill Toppeta :  What I am saying is I think it is most appropriate that we defer. 
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: That’s fair I guess. On the group insurance side, your results this quarter I think stand in stark contrast to a couple of your larger competitors in terms of loss ratios. I know you have talked about over the past couple of years some increased competition and maybe not just on price but on terms as well. So I am wondering with some of the elevated loss activity we are seeing at some of the guys who maybe were taking market share over the past couple of years whether you are seeing that come back to you in terms of new sales opportunities? If you could comment on what January 1 sales activity looked like in the group business? 
Bill Mullaney :  I can give you some perspective on first quarter sales. First quarter sales were relatively strong compared to our expectation. As I mentioned in response to an earlier question we took some pretty aggressive pricing actions in both disability and dental. As a result of that we expected sales to be down in the first quarter of 2010 relative to 2009. That actually occurred. You see that I think reflected in the top line of the non-medical health segment but pretty much in line with what we expected.  From a life insurance perspective pricing has continued to be very aggressive in group life segment particularly at the upper end of the market. We saw that very evidently in the first quarter of this year. We have, as we have talked about all along, been very disciplined about our pricing. Really over the last couple of years. That has had some impact on our sales results so our sales results in group life although in line with our expectations for 01/01 we are down relative to 2009. I think the real testament to the way we run our business is in the mortality ratio. We had one of the strongest mortality ratios we have had in group life in the first quarter which is typically not a great quarter for us.  We really feel like the strategy we have deployed over the last few years in terms of running that business is the right one and we think that is showing up in our results for this quarter particularly as it relates to the mortality ratio. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Eric Berg – Barclays Capital.
Eric Berg – Barclays Capital : It just seems like we are in this blissful state right now in which your yields are going up but you are somehow able to pay less to your customers in their crediting base. My question is why is that possible? One would think that an environment of improving yields that would be passed on to your customers and that yields and crediting rates would be moving in the same direction rather than an opposite direction. Maybe Steve or another member of the team could help me understand how those two numbers are moving away from each other rather than in parallel? 
Bill Wheeler :  You are absolutely right. Given the macro environment both crediting rates and yields should be going in the same direction. Then you manage to kind of a steady spread. But of course what is happening here is the macro environment didn’t change much in the first quarter and interest rates are still very low so as liabilities get re-priced or crediting rates get adjusted slowly for the whole book because sometimes crediting rates don’t change for as much as a year, that means that in a low environment you are still going to see crediting rates tick down.  For us the reason yields have gone up isn’t really because the interest rate environment is better. It is really because we are putting money to work. Cash balance has dropped this quarter and we are just getting better investment performance out of our alternative asset classes or through variable investment income. So that is why you see the…by the way I would say in general spreads widen but they are only getting back to normal in terms of, and if you compare them to our guidance that we gave this year they are a little better than guidance in many cases but really only back to normal. 
Rob Henrikson :  Thank you everyone.

Operator: Welcome to the MetLife fourth quarter earnings release. (Operator Instructions) Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife.  Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time-to-time in MetLife Incorporated's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife Incorporated specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Conor Murphy, Head of Investor Relations. 
Conor Murphy:  Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's fourth quarter 2009 earnings call. We are delighted to be here with you this morning to talk about our results. We will be discussing certain financial measures and updates on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplement both of which are available at Metlife.com on our Investor Relations page.  A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment related gains and losses which can fluctuate from period to period and may have significant impact on GAAP net income.  Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments we will take your questions. Here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management including Bill Mullaney, President of the U.S. business and Bill Toppeta, President of International.  With that I would like to turn the call over to Rob. 
Rob Henrikson :  Thank you Conor and good morning everyone.  Before we get into earnings results I would like to take a moment to comment on recent developments that we noted in our press release. As we stated, we are in discussions with AIG over the potential acquisition of ALICO but we have not reached an agreement and there is no certainty that we will. Beyond that I have nothing further to say about those discussions but as I have repeatedly said, MetLife does not need to enter into any eminent transaction to meet our business objectives and any transaction we undertake would be accretive and financially attractive to our shareholders, would accelerate our strategy and more importantly we would be confident in our ability to execute and realize the transaction’s economic value. In other words, our acquisition criteria have not changed.  Now let’s get started on our year-end results. During the fourth quarter MetLife delivered very strong results growing premiums, fees and other revenues to $9.3 billion, up 14% over the prior year and 10% sequentially. We converted growth into earnings with operating earnings of $793 million, significantly higher than they were a year ago and 10% higher than the third quarter of 2009. We have again demonstrated our strength as we grew our businesses and extended our lead in the marketplace and we did this while maintaining our discipline in underwriting, pricing and risk management.  Now let me share a few highlights from our businesses. In U.S. business results for the quarter were very good. Premiums, fees and other revenues was $7.8 billion, and grew 11% over the prior period driven by 32% growth in retirement products, 26% in corporate benefit funding and 8% in insurance products.  Within our insurance products segment we enjoyed growth across all product groups. Individual life delivered solid results with increased whole, term and universal life sales. Group life grew by nearly 10% and non-medical health grew by almost 5% due largely to continued organic growth in our dental business.  In retirement products the significant top line growth is due to higher income annuity premiums and fee income on our variable annuities. Total annuity sales were strong again at $4.2 billion, up from the third quarter and driven mostly by $3.7 billion of variable annuity sales. This performance reflects continued strong sales in our traditional markets including individual distribution, banks and wire houses as well as our expanded partnership with Fidelity. We also continued to experience positive net flows and declining lapse rates which I believe is a strong demonstration of a continuing flight to MetLife.  In corporate benefit funding premiums, fees and other revenues were $1 billion for the quarter, up from the prior period due to higher structured settlement premiums, another area where we have gained market share and increased pension close out premiums which were strong in both the U.S. and the U.K. Rounding out the U.S. business segments, auto and home also had another very solid quarter.  Turning to international, we achieved double digit growth across all of our regions. Premiums, fees and other revenues grew 22% over the prior period. Driven by strong growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil, our Latin America division grew its top line 18%. Asia Pacific grew 25% due to higher sales in Korea and China. In Japan annuity sales continued to be impacted by current market conditions with an 18% increase in fixed annuity sales and a 35% decline in variable annuity sales. In our European region which includes Europe, the Middle East and India, premiums, fees and other revenues increased by 32% driven by growth in India. With momentum in our international businesses we will continue to invest where we see growth opportunities.  At our Investor Day in December we talked about MetLife Bank and how closely the bank ties to our retirement strategy. As you can see, with another solid quarter the bank achieved almost $300 million in operating earnings for 2009, clearly a great result which we have built from two relatively small but important acquisitions. In a few moments you will hear from Steve about our investment portfolio but first I would like to say the results are good and as we projected at Investor Day our credit losses are much lower this quarter.  Looking back at the full year 2009 I am pleased with our strong and consistent performance particularly during a period marked by unprecedented economic events. We grew our premiums, fees and other revenues to $34 billion, up 4% over 2008. Our U.S. annuity sales totaled $21 billion, an increase of 10% over 2008 and our book value is recovering, up 37% from year-end 2008.  During this time, MetLife has truly distinguished itself by increasing market share and growing our business when others could not while at the same time practicing sound risk management and expense control. As we shared with you at Investor Day we are proud of the success of our operational excellence initiatives, surpassing our initial goal one year ahead of schedule and raising the bar relative to both expense management and operational efficiencies going forward. As we move forward to 2010 let me assure you we will exercise the same discipline that led us through the crisis and allowed us to extend our lead in the marketplace.  I believe we are well positioned for future growth backed by a strong brand, solid financial position and a talented and dedicated management team we have the foundation to create an even stronger, more valued and more profitable MetLife.  With that I will turn it over to Steve. 
Steve Kandarian :  Thanks Rob. I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter. First let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pre-tax variable investment income for the fourth quarter was $212 million which is above plan by $62 million primarily from strong corporate joint venture and hedge fund returns partially offset by continued negative real estate returns.  Let me touch on our investment activity during the quarter. As discussed at Investor Day we are reducing our cash position and purchasing spread assets as markets have stabilized. During the fourth quarter we reinvested approximately $1.6 billion of cash in spread assets. Our overall investment yield for spread assets during the quarter excluding short-term portfolios such as securities lending was approximately 5.2%.  Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses continued to decline and were $272 million. The write downs also continued to decline and were $297 million. These write downs included $164 million in structured finance securities, $52 million from the strengthening of the mortgage valuation allowance and $16 million of corporate securities. The write downs also included $49 million of hybrid securities and $16 million of partnerships and equity securities which were impaired because the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized costs.  Overall gross investment losses and impairments for Q4 excluding derivatives were at the lower end of the post-tax range discussed at Investor Day. Lapses from derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting were $810 million. This was primarily attributable to pre-tax losses of $383 million caused by higher interest rates and $327 million due to an improvement in MetLife’s own credit spread and its impact on the valuation of certain insurance liabilities.  Gross unrealized losses continued to decline and were $10.8 billion at December 31, down from $11.8 billion at September 30 and spreads declined across all sectors. For example, spreads for BBB rated corporate bonds in CMBS declined about 60 basis points during the quarter. However, the gross unrealized gain decreased to $8.6 billion due to higher interest rates. As a result, the net unrealized loss increased slightly to $2.2 billion from $1.6 billion at September 30.  Finally I would like to touch briefly upon our commercial mortgage holdings. During the fourth quarter we had no delinquencies in our U.S. portfolio and total delinquencies were only $8 million or two basis points on the overall portfolio. While we expect that delinquencies may increase in 2010 we view the level of delinquencies as manageable particularly given our mortgage valuation allowance of approximately $590 million. This allowance represents 1.7% of our portfolio which we believe would cover a 5.7% default rate.  The loan to valuation of our portfolio increased slightly to 68% from 67% based on a rolling four quarter valuation process as the pace of value declines slowed. We estimate that market values will decline an additional 5% during 2010. Our average debt to service coverage ratio remains strong at 2.2 times and loans above 80% loan to value have an average coverage ratio of 1.5 times. Long-term maturities remain manageable with only $2.1 billion maturing in 2010. While we expect that the real estate sector will remain challenged we are confident that our commercial mortgage portfolio will outperform the overall market.  With that I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler. 
Bill Wheeler :  Thanks Steve. Good morning everyone. MetLife reported $0.96 of operating earnings per share in the fourth quarter and $2.87 for the full year 2009 which are above our Investor Day estimates. As I think you will see our businesses performed well in the quarter. This morning I will walk through some financial results and point out some highlights as well as some unusual items which occurred during the fourth quarter.  Before I get started I just want to remind you I will now be speaking to our new U.S. business which consists of insurance products, retirement products, corporate benefit funding and auto and home. Also, as we had mentioned on last quarter’s call and again at Investor Day, MetLife Bank has become more impactful to our financial results and so with the fourth quarter of 2009 we have started separating the bank within banking, corporate and other in our QFS and so I will speak to the bank results as well.  With that let’s get started.  Let’s begin with premiums, fees and other revenues. Premiums, fees and other revenues which totaled $9.3 billion in the fourth quarter are up 14% from the fourth quarter of last year which is an excellent result. For the full year our top line revenues totaled $34 billion, a 4% increase over 2008. Total premiums, fees and other revenues for U.S. business of $7.8 billion reflect an 11% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008. The growth in insurance products revenues of 8% in the fourth quarter reflects across the board strength in group life, individual life and non-medical health. Retirement products revenue increase of 32% was driven by fee growth due to positive net flows and higher separate account investment returns and annuities as well as an increase in income annuity premiums. Revenue growth in corporate benefit funding of 26% was driven by strong structured settlement premiums in the current quarter.  International’s premiums, fees and other revenue are up 22% over the fourth quarter of 2008 on a reported basis and 13% on a constant currency basis driven by growth across all three international regions. MetLife Bank fees and other revenues from both forward and reverse mortgage activity increased $258 million from $94 million in the prior year period, an increase of 175%.  Turning to our operating margins let’s start with our underwriting results. In U.S. business our mortality results were very strong in both group life and individual life with the four-year mortality ratios coming in below Investor Day ranges. The group life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89.7% bringing the full year ratio to 90.3% versus our estimated range of 91-93%. Our individual mortality ratio for the quarter was 81.1% bringing the full year ratio to 82.5% versus our estimated range of 84-86%.  As I mentioned on Investor Day, historically we spoke about group disability morbidity ratios. Now that our dental business has become just as important as our disability business in terms of the bottom line at MetLife for non-medical health we will discuss a total benefits ratio that includes dental, disability and other non-medical health coverage’s such as long-term care which we think is a better indicator of morbidity trends across the products in this segment.  At 90.2% for the fourth quarter the total benefits ratio is up from 86.3% in the prior year quarter and that was driven by higher dental claims activity and weaker disability margins during the recession.  Turning to our auto and home business the combined ratios including catastrophes while up remains strong at 92.3% for the fourth quarter. This compares to last year’s result of 84.9%. Also, included in this combined ratio result is the non-capped prior year accident reserve release of $9 million after tax compared to a $27 million after-tax release in the prior year period.  Moving to investment spreads, as Steve mentioned investment spreads improved this quarter as we continued to shift funds from cash and government securities to higher yielding investments. In addition variable investment income continues to improve. With regard to variable investment income, as Steve explained, we again saw mixed performance in certain variable alternative asset classes this quarter, strong returns on corporate joint ventures and hedge funds but partially offset by negative returns in real estate. For the quarter variable investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $40 million or $0.05 per share above the 2009 quarterly plan.  Moving to expenses, our operational excellence initiative continues to prove successful but we had some unusual items flowing through expenses this quarter which drove our reported expenses up. Expenses at MetLife Bank were higher this quarter compared to the prior year due to the significant growth in that business and as I have mentioned in previous quarter’s pension and post-retirement benefit costs were also up from the prior year. This quarter we incurred $18 million after-tax in operational excellence charges which consisted mainly of real estate write downs. We also had certain one-time expenses this quarter that amounted to $44 million after tax. Together these items amounted to $0.08 per share. All of these expenses appear in corporate and other.  Turning to our bottom line results we earned $793 million in operating income or $0.96 per share. If you recall at Investor Day we noted that we anticipated a positive impact from annual [back in] lockings and other adjustments which we did not yet include in our projected operating earnings range because the amount was not yet final. This ultimately added $0.12 to our operating earnings. Offsetting this is an adjustment made in our international business relating to a change in assumptions for measuring the effects of inflation on inflation index securities in Chile, Argentina and Mexico. This reduced earnings by $0.13 per share. When we normalize for these two items as well as the other factors described earlier we are still above our Investor Day estimates.  With regard to investment gains and losses this quarter we had after-tax net realized investment losses of $557 million which included derivative losses of $527 million after-tax. As Steve mentioned, the derivative losses are primarily attributable to a tightening of MetLife’s own credit spread which amounted to $213 million after-tax and a rise in interest rates impacting our interest rate swaps and floors. MetLife uses derivatives to hedge a number of its risks. Changes in the values of these derivatives are in general offset on an economic basis across various assets and liabilities. Impairments were $193 million after-tax in the fourth quarter and have been declining each quarter in 2009.  Now I would like to take a moment to talk about cash and capital. For the fourth quarter preliminary statutory operating earnings are an estimated $730 million. For the full year 2009 we had preliminary statutory earnings of approximately $3.3 billion after-tax and preliminary net income of approximately $1.8 billion after-tax. Total adjusted statutory capital and surplus at year-end is approximately $21 billion. Cash and liquid assets at the holding company at year-end totaled $3.8 billion.  During the fourth quarter the holding company paid our annual common stock dividend amounting to just over $600 million. We also invested $375 million into Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC) in the form of surplus notes during the quarter. We have not finished our RBC calculations for year-end 2009 but based on our work today we are estimating that consolidated RBC will end the year at approximately 400, significantly above the 355-375 range provided at Investor Day. The increase was largely driven by better than expected results in the NEIC re-rating of RMBS securities as well as generally stronger fundamentals.  I would like to point out one thing about our book value. Book value per share including AOCI was $37.96 at year-end and that is a little lower than our Investor Day projection. This was almost entirely driven by an overall increase in interest rates during December. The general account which was essentially at break-even just before Investor Day moved to a small unrealized loss at quarter end. By the way, since quarter end the general account has swung back to an unrealized gain.  In summary our revenue growth remains strong. Our investment performance has improved and our earnings have grown considerably over the course of 2009. With that I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.   
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Nigel Dally – Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Dally – Morgan Stanley: I was [inaudible] within a broad range of different regulatory tax proposals, financial services responsibility fees, the Volcker rules, reduction in dividend, received deductions, is it possible to discuss the impact of those proposals on your fundamental outlook? I know it is still very early stages but any perspective to help dimension that would be very helpful. 
Bill Wheeler :  I am sorry, a little bit of an echo here. I think what you asked was just in case not everybody heard it…I think what you asked about was the financial responsibility fee and then also the recent administration proposal regarding taxes.
Nigel Dally – Morgan Stanley: Correct. 
Bill Wheeler :  The financial responsibility fee, I am sure Rob will maybe have a comment about this; I would like to think that number would be zero given what it is labeled. But I think based on everybody’s assumptions regarding how that will be interpreted and implemented it will have a relatively modest effect on our results. Frankly it all depends on what the details are in terms of do they exclude insurance liabilities. I read something the other day which said they might exclude repos which consistent with that it would mean you would also exclude securities lending footings, so I think if you are really just talking about our debt balances that would be affected by the fee which I think that is where that ultimately goes. It is a really modest number. We are talking a few pennies.  But again, I am not sure why we would pay anything. With regard to the administration’s tax proposals again the details are really preliminary. I would say with regard to the [SOLI] proposal or anything to do with the IOLI those are immaterial to us and I think in some ways could obviously help us. With regard to the DRD benefit, our total benefit that we received from the dividends [received] today is approximately $0.20 annually. So that is I guess what is potentially at risk. It is not clear to me if the proposal would assume the assumption of the loss of all of that or a piece of it. That is hard to say.  I think kind of a silver lining here maybe is that as marginal tax rates go up on individuals that probably on the margin increases the demand for a lot of our insurance products. So there are obviously some ways to get penalized in this tax bill, there may be some benefits as well. 
Rob Henrikson :  Only because Bill said I would have something to say about this, I would say I can’t improve on his answer in any way other than just to point out as he stated, there are many discussions going on about this in terms of definitions, unintended consequences and so forth and those discussions are occurring with Treasury, with various people on the hill who have responsibilities relative to the committees that are overseeing this and so forth. I would say stay tuned but Bill’s answers are right on. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman – UBS. 
Andrew Kligerman – UBS: A few questions and maybe even most important is as the M&A environment is changing you mentioned in the call and in your press release that any transaction needs to meet your criteria. When I evaluate a transaction I like to know what is the return on invested capital. So if you were to do a deal, any deal, what type of return would you want on your capital and over what timeframe? 
Rob Henrikson :  I apologize and I don’t mean to duck you. Obviously at the right time I would be happy to answer that question. I just don’t want to kind of give any more back door color on the discussions we are currently having with AIG regarding ALICO. So if you don’t mind I would just as soon skip that one until another day. 
Andrew Kligerman – UBS: I mind but I guess we will have to skip it anyway. With regard to the investment portfolio and Steve gave some excellent color around the commercial mortgage loan portfolio but just kind of looking at the losses you had about $1.3 billion in Q4 2008 and down to about $1.2 billion in 3Q 2009 and then this quarter you are looking at less than $600 million. The guidance was for about $1 billion in after-tax investment losses and economic investment losses in 2010. Does that indicate you are right on track to that? Maybe just a little color of how you feel about that guidance now? 
Steve Kandarian :  Investment losses are trending down nicely. We are seeing our impairment number coming down. Our loss number is coming down and actually some of our gains going up. So it is reflecting the marketplace overall especially the tighter spreads we are seeing in the marketplace. In terms of what we are projecting and thinking about for the coming year or the current year I should say we think the trend will continue to improve. That is based upon our view of the overall economy which is it will be a slow recovery but a slow and steady recovery. Obviously if it is a faster recovery the numbers could get even better. If there is a double dip which we are not projecting they could turn around and get worse.  We have seen some real improvement over the course of the year and even some of the securities we impair most of them are still paying us in full and we are very hopeful in terms of how this will play out over time. 
Andrew Kligerman – UBS: Lastly, with regard to RBC Bill mentioned about a 400% ratio at the end of the year, cash and liquidity at the holding co. of about $3.8 billion. Just in terms of an update, what is your redeployable capital at the end of the year and do you anticipate given the higher RBC ratio any need to downstream money to the [life] during the year? 
Bill Wheeler :  Redeployable capital, do you mean excess capital? 
Andrew Kligerman – UBS: Excess capital. 
Bill Wheeler :  Definitions worry me. Well, I think we have said a couple of lines in the sand here. We need to hold $750 million of cash at the holding company so $3.8 billion minus 750 is just a little over $3 billion obviously. We have also said many times we view the line in the sand regarding RBC is 350 on a consolidated basis. Obviously that turns out to be about 50 RBC points higher than where we are today. You can think $60 an RBC point. So that is $3 billion. In terms of do I think we will need to make investment in the insurance subs I do not. I expect those businesses to have a respectable level of profitability in 2010. This is the highest consolidated RBC ratio we have ever posted so we have more cushion now in those businesses than we ever really had. So I don’t think we will have to put money down and in fact I fully expect to pay meaningful dividends up to the holding company in 2010. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein. 
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: A quick follow-up to Nigel’s question about the regulatory reforms. I am not sure you commented on the one that he mentioned, the Volcker changes around hedge funds and corporate JVs. Is there going to be any impact as far as you can tell on your investment strategies as it relates to your alternative portfolio? 
Rob Henrikson :  Obviously the details are to come. We don’t know how this will impact us if at all. As you know we do invest in hedge funds. We have $1.3 billion currently outstanding in hedge funds. The proprietary trading aspect wouldn’t really apply to us. So we are sort of staying tuned but we are regulated of course by the states and we have RBC charges against any and all assets that we purchase so I would think the logic would suggest this will not touch us but again, we will have to see how the bill is written. 
Bill Wheeler :  The only thing that I would add to that is that I think the thesis was investing that you do on behalf of your clients and customers versus your own account. Well all of our investing is for our customers and clients. We don’t have some [inaudible]. So I think that is a pretty key distinction. 
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: On the investment portfolio I think you mentioned $1.6 billion of cash invested in the fourth quarter. I am wondering what the new money investment rate on that was and where you put it to work in which asset class? Then as it relates to the consolidated yield X the short-term portfolio 5.2% how does that compare to your pricing assumption as you think about managing the business? 
Steve Kandarian :  We are investing across a broad array of assets or the entire sort of array that we normally invest in. Our yield is about 5.2% when you exclude things like securities lending. As of now it is hard to know exactly where that is going to go in the current year but we are certainly seeing a little pick up here in interest rates but we are also seeing spreads tightening. I am not quite sure I understood the last part of your question regarding what this means…were you referring the liability side how we are doing credit rates? What is the question there? 
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: The question was what rate did you put the $1.6 billion? I think the 5.2% relates to the total portfolio. As it relates to the other question, I assume you have in your pricing model some sort of a yield assumption or you assume we are going to get this level of yield and I am wondering what that number is, if you can give a range as in comparison to the 5.2%. 
Rob Henrikson :  There is no simple number there. I mean obviously every product we sell has different duration characteristics and the portfolio makeup is quite different in terms of how much will be in Treasuries or private equities or corporate or what have you. So every product has a different sort of target new money yields. I would say this though, keep in mind any sort of product we have that has sort of I would say a fixed component to it whether it is like a fixed annuity or a structured settlement, those get repriced pretty continuously. It is not literally every day but certainly most every day. So whenever the new money yields are at that time gets factored into our pricing so that we earn our requisite spreads. So it is really quite dynamic in terms of how we manage pricing there.  As I think we have said on a number of occasions this whole year we have been raising prices or in some ways lowering crediting rates on our products all year pretty much across the board. So it is something to factor in when you think about our revenue growth here especially with the backdrop of the kind of pricing changes we have made it is really quite impressive. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Darin Arita – Deutsche Bank. 
Darin Arita – Deutsche Bank: I was hoping you could comment on the financial leverage of MetLife. What is the number that you are looking at, I know there are some adjustments you have made to that? Also just wondering how much of that in hybrid capacity you have from those numbers? 
Steve Kandarian :  Not to give anybody a little free advertising but we generally look at the Moody’s leverage ratio and they are sort of how to discuss it. You are right, there is a lot of different ways to calculate leverage and everybody does it a little differently. On a Moody’s leverage ratio basis we are just under 30%. At that leverage ratio we are a little under 30%. So I would say as of now based on that ratio our current capacity for more better hybrid financing is nearly zero. Keep in mind one thing though, and this is sort of a conscious decision we made, we at the beginning 2009 in the throes of the financial crisis we said if we have an ability to go issue debt or raise money and raise cash to deal with whatever problems occur we are going to do that because our debt leverage ratio at the end of 2008 was below 25% I think or around 25%.  So we consciously issued securities, moved up the leverage ratio and then warehoused that cash on our balance sheet. That is why we have such a big cash balance at the holding company. We let the leverage ratio go up. The good news is happily we needed almost none of that money. We did put a little down in the insurance subs at year-end as discussed but the rest of it is still sitting there. So if you think about it, that is where my debt capacity went. It is now sitting in cash. I have already used it and it is sitting in cash at my holding company. 
Darin Arita – Deutsche Bank: Turning to the auto and home segment, overall results looked good but as I looked at the auto segment the combined ratio ticked up above 100%. Anything happening there? 
Bill Wheeler :  Let me start by saying the fourth quarter is really seasonally the worst quarter for us for auto and the best quarter for homeowners. Our combined ratio target for the fourth quarter of 2009 was actually about 98. Now that being said there was about an 8.5 point change from Q4 2008 to Q4 2009 and the drivers of that change look like this; it is about three points less from prior year development which is still favorable as you are aware. We had about two points from one-time items and the remaining 3.5 points was from an increase in non-accident year loss ratio of about which one point was adverse weather and the other two points came from an increase in auto injury costs which we are also seeing in the industry and we are addressing through pricing.  Now looking at the year which removes the seasonality the auto combined ratio came in at 94.7 which is an excellent result and still below our long-term target of 96. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein - Macquarie. 
Mark Finkelstein - Macquarie : I want to actually go back to kind of along Andrew’s lines. Maybe just help with the framework here. On capital if you add up what is excess or I should say capital margin at the insurance company plus the holding company cash less the $750 million you typically think about as one year’s fixed charges you get down to about a $6 billion number and obviously you need to keep a margin but is there any framework you can give us in terms of how you think about what would be a deployable number on an acquisition or what have you out of that $6 billion? 
Rob Henrikson :  Obviously excess at the holding company is available to do other things with. So that is sort of which you could draw it all down, you could draw some of it down, well that is obviously situational. The stuff at the insurance company we will be able to access that obviously through dividends in 2010 but as long as it is in the insurance sub there is not much I can do with it. Obviously some of it will come out in 2010 and I will have to use some of that money to pay interest and preferred and common dividends at the holding company but obviously some of that is available during 2010 to use for other purposes. But again I guess I would say that is situational. 
Mark Finkelstein - Macquarie : Maybe just to kind of elaborate, would you be comfortable using that $3 billion at the holding company? 
Rob Henrikson :  Ultimately sure. 
Mark Finkelstein - Macquarie : Steve, based on your forecast on real estate I think you mentioned you see another 5% down commercial real estate. Based on that assumption would it be your assumption that we would continue to see further write downs in the real estate funds or do we think with the write downs we showed in the fourth quarter that we are kind of factoring that in? 
Steve Kandarian :  As to the real estate funds I would say we have taken a large amount of write downs to date and there could be some more coming in the current year but I would not anticipate it being the same level certainly as 2009. 
Mark Finkelstein - Macquarie : On the delinquency build on commercial mortgage loans, it looks like you added about $50 million to that allowance. What is the commentary on that? Given where you are in terms of the actual delinquencies in the portfolio do we expect to see continued build in that? 
Steve Kandarian :  We look forward 12 months when we put that number together. The delinquencies as I mentioned are very small, only $8 million all off-shore at this point in time. The real estate does have a lag effect and as the economy dips eventually commercial real estate mortgages will default in some cases but it tends to happen over a couple of year period of time. So we think this reserve is an adequate reserve, a conservative reserve but a good reserve. We will re-evaluate it every quarter and based upon market conditions we will make changes up or down as time goes on. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach. 
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: I have a couple of questions and I think they are really quick. How much was the negative component in variable investment income from the real estate fund in the fourth quarter? 
Steve Kandarian:  It was a couple of hundred million dollars. 
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: How much was the benefit from the TIMCO RMBS re-rating on the risk based capital ratio and related to that do you think the rating agencies give you credit for that or give the industry credit for that? 
Rob Henrikson :  I thought you said this was going to be quick. As I start my soliloquy I think on Investor Day we said the benefits from the NEIC re-rating would be between 15-20 RBC points. It is better than that. The number isn’t final yet but it is clearly better. I would tell you since you have given me this opportunity I would say I kind of want people to understand something that I think it sometimes gets lost here. Somehow this is perceived as a freebie. We had substantial ratings migration in the RMBS sector during 2009. We did get an adjustment from the NEIC re-rating process but even net of all that the capital charge if you will from that ratings migration on a net basis was still over $1 billion. So ratings migration still hurt us significantly in terms of our capital levels in 2009.  So it is not like it is that big a deal. I would say in terms of the ratings agencies giving credit for it, I don’t think you ever are going to get quite a straight answer from them. I don’t think they are ever just going to say yes, unequivocally. I think they do understand the point of why this was done and I think depending on who you talk to inside the rating agencies they accept the methodology and given uniquely what has happened to RMBS that sort of the rating agency ratings versus the ratings used to match up with the NEIC ratings doesn’t really work anymore. That methodology is sort of broken and I think you will get consensus on that.  I do effectively think they will give us credit for it but they will look at it closely. Obviously time will tell in terms of how these securities continue to perform. If they are consistent with the NEIC’s re-rating process and we think they will be, ultimately of course they will give credit for it. 
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: I don’t want to get into ALICO but just thinking about potential financing for any sort of deal, I guess two questions; one, would you entertain the idea of selling any of your current businesses to help generate cash to finance something else? 
Rob Henrikson :  I have a list here. See if I can scare everybody. We really don’t want to talk about this but the answer is no. 
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: I will try one more. You have a lot of extra capital that doesn’t get credit for in risk based capital or other places in your off-shore reinsurance entity. I think at year-end you put around a $2 billion number on that. I am wondering if any of that capital is available to the holding company or otherwise if needed for some other reason? 
Rob Henrikson :  I guess it is theoretically available but that is just not something we would consider. I think that is a really, really bad risk management practice. That is not something we would ever entertain. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Edward Spehar – Bank of America/Merill Lynch. 
Edward Spehar – Bank of America/Merill Lynch: I wanted to go back to the comment you made about you expect to pay meaningful dividends from the insurance subsidiary in 2010. Would this be your expectation independent of whether or not you do an acquisition? 
Bill Wheeler :  Yes. 
Edward Spehar – Bank of America/Merill Lynch: If so why, it is unclear to me then why you put capital down in the sub in the fourth quarter considering that you expect to pay a material dividend this year. 
Bill Wheeler :  I feel a little foolish too. Obviously to get credit for it we need to put the capital down before year-end. So on December 28th I am looking at my Treasurer, slightly just before year-end we said we think the RBC ratio looks good but obviously the numbers aren’t final and things could jump around so let’s be safe rather than sorry and let’s put some money down. In hindsight we didn’t need to do that. So I think the good news is we can probably get it back out relatively quickly. We clearly didn’t need to do it. By the way, that 375 just to put it in context that is roughly 6 plus points of RBC so we clearly didn’t need to do it. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Colin Devine – Citigroup. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: I wanted to clarify a couple of points. In terms of the target capital structure with this deal out there, what Moody’s holds you to obviously the 30% debt if you can do the 10% hybrid on top of that is question number one. Question two, can you talk a little bit more about the dental business? This is really the first time you have sort of held it out there as how much money you make. If you could expand a little bit. I’m not going to use the word color…I don’t think any of us want to hear that one again but perhaps you could expand a little bit on what is driving the dental business and you also talked about potentially doing some M&A there so not on the ALICO situation but perhaps some of the other opportunities you are looking at to accelerate the growth of MetLife right now. 
Bill Wheeler :  I really don’t want to talk about ALICO or sort of theoretical financing situations but I just would remind everybody if you issue common you create debt capacity and you create hybrid capacity. So by putting that additional common footings out there. That is sort of how the math works. In terms of, I talked about on our current balance sheet today I don’t think we have any incremental debt or hybrid capacity. That doesn’t mean we wouldn’t add some by issuing common. Hopefully that is clear to people. 
Bill Mullaney :  Just to give you some perspective at Investor Day we talked about changing the benefit ratio that we report out, moving away from the disability ratio to a non-medical health ratio. The reason we did that is in non-medical health dental is about 50% of the total premiums today. Disability premium is less than 25% of non-medical health and less than 5% of U.S. business overall so the dental business over the last several years because of the growth we have gotten, primarily organic growth but also from a small acquisition we did in 2008, has become a very important part of the U.S. business growth story.  In terms of our outlook for dental going forward as you know, dental faced some pressure from an earnings perspective in 2009. We saw utilization spike up we think directly related to the increase in unemployment. However that has started to stabilize as we look at the fourth quarter and we have taken some significant pricing actions both from a renewal perspective as well as a new business perspective going into 2010. So we expect earnings on that business to begin to rebound.  In terms of acquisitions for that business it is a great business for us as we have talked about before. It has been a strong grower. It has a very high ROE because the capital requirements for dental are low. The acquisition we did in 2008 which was a small DHMO acquisition in some key states in the west and the southwest not only helped us to grow the acquired business faster but it gave us entry into customers that we were not able to quote on before for our traditional PPO business because we didn’t have the DHMO capability. So if we could do other acquisitions like that it would help to expand out our DHMO capability as well as our traditional dental capability in other markets. We would certainly do that. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Can you perhaps what is a high ROE for you? Is that a 15-20% ROE if I think of Met’s long-term target? Or 12-13? Is it better than that? 
Bill Mullaney :  The historical ROE on dental is north of 20%. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: With the defaults on Peter Cooper can you just reiterate perhaps one more time so that I will sleep better than Met has no residual exposure to that? 
Steve Kandarian :  That is correct. We sold that property. It was a cash sale. We did not buy for example any of the CMBS that was issued out of that sale. All of our purchase price considerations were received at closing. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: You are not thinking of getting back into it? 
Rob Henrikson :  I don’t know if they heard your question. So my ears are really clean this morning. No. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Jeff Schuman – KBW. 
Jeff Schuman – KBW : We talked a little bit about some of the tax and regulatory proposals but given there are a lot of things potentially floating out there in terms of regulatory reform and some of the changes may carry various costs or burdens or limitations for banks and bank holding companies, I am wondering how weathered you are necessarily to keeping the bank and being a bank holding company under all scenarios. I know you are pretty pleased with how it is running now. Is there a limit to the inconvenience you would accept under certain new regulatory scenarios? 
Rob Henrikson :  Let me take a crack at that. In the first place with the discussions occurring in Washington now and I would broaden and just emphasize that you have a lot of people involved in discussions on this whole topic and therefore it is moving and quite fluid. I would say it probably moves in terms of rhetoric a little bit differently since recent elections have changed a little bit the landscape in terms of people being willing to change rhetoric and compromise and so forth and so on. We like the bank very much. The fact that we are federally regulated as a bank holding company in and of itself has caused really no problems for us in terms of moving forward and we don’t see that it would cause problems anyway.  Much of the discussion going back if you put it all together over the last several months one would wonder whether it made any difference whether you were a bank holding company or not. So certainly it wouldn’t make any sense to divest something under the theory that would somehow insulate from all regulatory reform and then turn around and in the end see you have sold something that had a great deal of value, was strategically valued and helped us to cross-sell products and services.  We are always looking at the landscape, always looking at the value. If in fact this somehow created some sort of value deterioration for our shareholders obviously we would take whatever actions necessary. 
Jeff Schuman – KBW : You did see an improvement in individual life sales this quarter or year-over-year. Does that reflect the market coming back a little bit or did you have some company specific things at work here or how should we read that? 
Bill Mullaney :  Individual sales did improve. We saw individual sales up about 13% over the last quarter and 17% up year-over-year. A lot of that came from whole life. Whole life sales were up a lot in both our agency as well as our third-party channel. We also saw an increase in term sales which came primarily from third-party and an increase in universal life sales and a decrease in variable sales because of the changes in the equity market. We are pretty happy with what we are seeing in the individual life market. We have made some changes to our products and some changes to our pricing. Increasing prices on certain products in certain segments to improve the return. So to play off something Bill Wheeler said earlier, we have a pretty dynamic approach to pricing all of our products and from a life insurance perspective we have been taking a look at some of the returns we have been making and changing our prices to improve some of the returns. Despite that we are seeing increased sales which we think is a function of our brand and a flight to quality. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher – Credit Suisse. 
Tom Gallagher – Credit Suisse: I wanted to come back to a comment you made on your hold co. cash position. I think your response was that the full I believe $3-4 billion of excess cash at the holding company would ultimately be available for redeployment. What do you mean by ultimately? Is the thought that the $3-4 billion is a real nice cushion to have just given the economic uncertainty so you would rather sit on that for the time being? Or can you just elaborate in terms of how you are thinking about it? 
Bill Wheeler :  Just so it is clear, the $3-4 billion we have $3.8 billion in cash at the holding company. We need $750 million so the excess in my mind is $3 billion. It is excess. So it is available. The timing of that again obviously for me to try and say near-term versus long-term just invites speculation about ALICO which I am really not going to do. In my mind that is all excess that really is excess capital and it is ultimately available. Whether I spend it sooner rather than later, that is a judgment call we will make. 
Tom Gallagher – Credit Suisse: So bottom line is given the strong RBC other potential levers you would be comfortable, forget about ALICO, you would be comfortable using the excess cash over the $750 million to do something with that immediately? So you don’t feel the need to sit on dry powder per se? 
Bill Wheeler :  I didn’t say immediately but I did say ultimately and I think we know the difference there. It is excess cash. 
Tom Gallagher – Credit Suisse: One question for Steve on the mortgage reserve and your comment on the default rate. I just want to make sure I understand the math. So you were saying your current mortgage reserve would cover a 5.7% default rate and I get the fact that is because you expect to have recoveries because you have pretty good LTVs. But can you tell me what your recovery assumption would be embedded in that comment? 
Steve Kandarian :  We are assuming a 30% loss, 70% recovery based upon the nature of these mortgages we are looking at and historical norms and past cycles and so on. Then I should take the opportunity to just go back to Colin’s question one second on Peter Cooper’s [inaudible]. I think most of you know there is a lawsuit outstanding in which we are a named party. It relates to some really complicated tax issues. I won’t go into the details of that but our exposure based upon our analysis is to be a relatively small number. Should the plaintiffs be successful in that lawsuit it would be less than 1% of the sale price of that property so we view it as being relatively immaterial. 
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife third quarter earnings release. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time-to-time in MetLife Incorporated's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife Incorporated specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Conor Murphy, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Conor Murphy: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2009 earnings call. We are delighted to be here this morning to talk about our results for the quarter. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, or so-called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplement, both of which are available on our website at MetLife.com. Our reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment-related gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period, and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments, we will take your questions and here with us today to participate in the discussion are Bill Mullaney, President of our U.S. Businesses; and Bill Toppeta, President of International; as well as other members of management. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Henrikson: Thank you, Conor and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, MetLife continue to perform well as our diverse mix of complementary businesses and our solid fundamentals yielded a strong result. We generated premiums, fees, and other revenues of $8.5 billion, consistent with both last quarter and the prior year period. Operating earnings this quarter were $718 million, an increase of 18% over the third quarter of 2008. And book value also improved, rising 27% over the second quarter of 2009 and 10% over the third quarter of 2008.  The results we have achieved are noteworthy, especially given the challenging economic environment. They also reflect our unwavering focus on growing our business while also maintaining our pricing discipline.  Let me highlight a few examples from each of our businesses.  Institutional generated solid top line results as premiums, fees, and other revenues were $4.2 billion for the quarter. Excluding the impact of lower pension close-out sales compared to this period last year, the top line grew by 3%. Group Life grew by 2.3% versus prior year, and non-medical health was up 3.2%, due mostly to our continued organic growth in the dental market.  Disability premiums are down year over year but this reflects our continued strict pricing discipline in both new business and renewals. In addition, we continued to capture market share in structured settlements as sales increased significantly this quarter.  From an underwriting perspective, group life mortality was right in line with our expectations. Our disability morbidity ratio rose above the target range for the first time this year. While it is too early to tell whether or not this is a trend, we are watching it closely.  Dental results, which continued to be impacted by higher utilization, did improve sequentially so we may be seeing signs of a peak here.  In individual business, the top line grew 4.8% over the prior year. Much like last quarter, we increased sales of our whole and term life products. In our annuity business, total deposits remained strong at $4 billion, with variable annuities at $3.4 billion and fixed annuities at $600 million.  Annuity net flows remained positive for the sixth consecutive quarter. We are very pleased with both the amount and the quality of the annuity business we wrote in the quarter.  In international, premiums, fees, and other revenues increased 9% year over year on a constant currency basis, as we had solid growth across all three of our international regions. Latin America’s top line grew 6%, driven by increased sales in Mexico and Brazil. In Asia, our top line grew 11% due to higher sales in Korea and Hong Kong. In Japan, total annuity deposits were $1.3 billion, with fixed annuity deposits up 27% and variable annuity deposits down 39%, reflecting current conditions in this market.  Finally, our European region, which includes our business in India, had top line growth of 12%.  Our auto and home business also had another solid quarter, delivering earnings of $86 million and producing a strong combined ratio of 91.1%.  Turning to investments, Steve will provide you with a detailed update in a moment. Let me just highlight -- in addition to experiencing higher net investment income, the value of our portfolio recovered considerably this quarter as net unrealized losses dropped to $1.6 billion. This amount now represents less than half of 1% of our general account assets and is actually lower than net unrealized losses as of June 30, 2008 before the deepening of the crisis.  The results we have achieved this quarter are due to a number of attributes that define MetLife, not the least of which is our financial strength. As you know, we have maintained a very strong capital position throughout this period of uncertainty. We kept our common stock dividend at $0.74 per share in 2008 and this year our board has declared another annual dividend, again of $0.74 per share.  In addition to revenue growth and capital strength, maintaining a focus on efficiencies and expense discipline has been a priority for us. With our operational excellence initiative, we are not only improving the efficiency of our organization but we are also on pace to exceed our goal of $400 million in annualized savings. And of course, our newly formed U.S. business organization is progressing very well, as we finalize its strategic and operational plans. We will share more strategy updates with you at investor day on December the 7th.  At this time last year, I told you that we were entering a period during which MetLife would set itself apart due to its stability and strength. I believe the performance we have delivered since then has demonstrated that our focus on long-term success is what has made MetLife the kind of company that customers and shareholders want to be associated with. No doubt there are challenges that remain but looking forward, it is our discipline in growth, pricing, expenses, and allocation of capital that will allow us to remain financially strong further sets us apart in the marketplace, and grow this company profitably. I am confident that MetLife will continue to build its leading market positions as we remain focused on long-term success.  And with that, I will turn it over to Steve. 
Steve Kandarian: Thanks, Rob. I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter.  First let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income for the third quarter was $105 million, which is below plan by $45 million, primarily driven by negative real estate fund returns. Real estate fund returns were negative, given the continued decline in property values. In total, we believe the overall property values have declined 30% to date and could decline another 10%.  Income from our corporate joint ventures, hedge funds, and securities lending program outperformed plan. However, we expect that variable income will remain below plan in the fourth quarter, primarily due to continued softness in real estate funds.  Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses were $491 million, down from the previous quarter. Write-downs this quarter were $661 million, also lower than the second quarter. These write-downs were experienced across a variety of sectors, including $146 million in corporate securities, $139 million from the strengthening of the mortgage valuation allowance, $77 million in structured finance securities, and $46 million in a real estate partnership.  Write-downs also included $215 million of hybrid securities and $38 million of partnership and equity securities, which were impaired because the length of time in the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost.  Overall net investment losses for Q3 excluding derivatives declined to $854 million from $1.1 billion for Q2. We expect this favorable trend to continue going forward.  Losses from derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting were $1.3 billion. This is primarily attributable to a $895 million pretax loss driven by an improvement in MetLife's own credit spread and its impact on the valuation of certain insurance liabilities.  MetLife's average credit spread decreased 315 basis points over the quarter. This reverses derivative gains in previous quarters that occurred when our credit spread widened. The remaining loss was caused by several factors that negatively impacted the valuation of our derivatives, including the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies, which reduced the value of our foreign currency swaps used to hedge foreign denominated assets, and the decline in general credit spreads which decreased the value of credit default protection we purchased for our corporate bond portfolio.  Gross unrealized losses of fixed maturities were $11.4 billion at September 30th, down substantially from $19.5 billion at June 30th, and spreads declined across all sectors. Total net unrealized losses showed an even more remarkable decline to $1.6 billion from $14.6 billion at June 30th.  Next I’d like to discuss the ratings migration within the fixed maturities portfolio. As of September 30th, below investment grade fixed maturity holdings increased $3.1 billion based upon estimated fair value, of which $1.5 billion was due to market value improvements and $1.6 billion from ratings downgrades. The downgrade’s primarily attributable to our non-agency residential mortgage backed portfolio, which we’ve discussed with you previously. However, we expect that for purposes of risk-based capital, the proposed plan endorsed by a committee of the NAIC will result in capital charges that are more aligned with the risk of loss than the current methodology.  We anticipate that our portfolio, which has a high percentage of super senior and senior tranches and fixed rate collateral, will perform better than the overall market.  I’d like to briefly touch upon our commercial mortgage holdings, where delinquencies and losses remain minimal. We had no defaults in our U.S. portfolio during the third quarter and current delinquencies are only $3 million, or 1 basis point on the overall portfolio. The current portfolio loan to value is approximately 67%, based on a rolling four quarter valuation process. In addition, our current commercial mortgage valuation allowance is $542 million.  I look forward to speaking with you at the 2009 investor day, where I will provide additional detail on our portfolio and expectations for 2010. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.
Bill Wheeler: Thanks, Steve and good morning, everybody. MetLife reported $0.87 of operating earnings per share for the third quarter. This morning I will walk through our financial results and point out some highlights, as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter. Let’s begin with premiums, fees, and other revenues.  Institutional revenues declined 7.7% as compared to the third quarter of 2008, due to lower close-out sales in the current period. As I have said many times, close-out sales can vary significantly by quarter. Sometimes we say that’s lumpy. Excluding the impact of pension closeout sales, institutional revenues were up 3% versus the prior year.  Individuals revenues were up 4.8% in the quarter, due mainly to a 15.2% increase in annuity revenues. This result was driven by increased sales of income annuities, strong variable annuity sales and net flows, as well as a 15% increase in the S&P 500.  International had reported revenues of $1.1 billion in the third quarter compared to $1.2 billion in the year-ago period. A stronger dollar relative to currencies such as the Mexican Peso and the Korean Won depressed international’s reported revenues in the quarter by $152 million when compared to the third quarter of last year. If you look at it on a constant dollar basis, revenue growth was 8.9% compared to the third quarter of 2008.  Another important contributor to our revenue growth was MetLife Bank, which is part of our corporate and other reporting segment. The bank’s revenues have increased $232 million over the year-ago period, due to the acquisitions of both the forward mortgage and reverse mortgage operation in 2008. Also, forward and reverse mortgage origination volumes have increased substantially this year.  It is our intention to break out financial data concerning the bank in the fourth quarter QFS and we will also be discussing the bank’s results at our investor day in December.  Overall we had premiums, fees, and other revenues of $8.5 billion, which is a 1.2% decline compared to $8.6 billion in the third quarter of last year. If one excludes pension close-out revenues and adjusts for the currency fluctuations, our revenue actually grew 6.6% year over year, which we think is an excellent result in this environment.  Turning to our operating margins, let’s start with our underwriting results. In institutional, group life mortality of 92.2%, which was well within our guidance range of 91 to 95. In non-medic health and other, group disabilities morbidity ratio was 96.4% for the quarter. Disability claims incidents has picked up in the third quarter after several quarters of stable experience, although there was a similar up-tick in the year-ago period.  Recoveries, which have been lower than anticipated all year, remained below expectations. Dental claim utilization remained high and our 2010 renewal pricing has been adjusted to reflect higher levels of claims activity in that product area.  Individuals’ mortality ratio was high this quarter at 91.2%, due mainly to several large base amount claims. However, re-insurance coverage offset the high direct mortality ratio and the net underwriting results were relatively normal.  Turning to auto and home, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, remains strong at 91.1% versus last year’s combined ratio of 89%. Catastrophe experience was much lower this year due to the absence of significant hurricane activity. Also, included in this combined ratio result is a non-cap prior accident year reserve release of $7 million after tax, compared to a $27 million after-tax release in the same period of 2008.  Moving to investment spreads, investment spreads generally improved this quarter as some funds were shifted from cash and government securities to higher yielding investments. In addition, variable investment income increased sequentially, although it was still down versus the year-ago period.  With regard to variable investment income, as Steve has explained, we again saw mixed performance of certain variable alternative asset classes this quarter, negative returns on real estate were offset by strong results in securities lending, hedge funds, and corporate joint ventures.  For the quarter, variable investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $32 million, or $0.04 per share lower than the 2009 quarterly plan.  Our earnings in the annuity portion of individual business were negatively impacted by a significant drop in interest rates this quarter and I want to take a minute to explain why. The accounting pronouncement, SOP03-1, requires us to reserve for expected future GMIB claims by estimating the future annuitization rate on account balances and the comparing it to our guaranteed annuitization rate on the customer benefit base for all contracts.  In general, when interest rates fall as they did in the third quarter, the reserve model calculates higher expected GMIB claims in the future, which increases our GMIB reserves. This phenomenon mainly impacts our older GMI block and we have re-insurance on this business which partially offset the interest rate movements. However, the reserve impact this quarter more than offset the positive impacts from equity market increases. The net result was a decrease of $46 million after tax, or $0.06 per share.  Moving to expenses, our overall reported expenses were higher this quarter versus the year-ago period but that was driven by much higher expenses at MetLife Bank and higher pension and post retirement benefit costs, partially offset by continued progress in our operational excellence initiative. As Rob mentioned, we are confident we will exceed our $400 million goal and intend to announce a new target at the December investor day.  Also, we incurred $47 million pretax in operational excellence charges this quarter, which consisted mainly of severance payments and real estate related expenses.  Turning to our bottom line results, we earned $718 million in operating income, or $0.87 per share. With regard to net investment gains and losses in the third quarter, we had net realized investment losses of $1.4 billion after tax, which of course seems like a big number but you have to keep in mind our derivative losses were $857 million after taxes and as Steve mentioned, the largest portion of that result was a $582 million after-tax loss caused by the tightening of MetLife's own credit spreads.  Most of the remaining derivative losses were due to changes in currency rates and a decline in CVS spreads generally, which were substantially offset in our strong AOCI improvement this quarter.  Now I’d like to take a moment to talk about cash and capital. Let me start by telling you that our cash and liquid assets at the holding company stood at $5 billion as of September 30. As you know, MetLife's board of directors has declared an annual common stock dividend of $0.74 per share, which amounts to a little over $600 million. We will pay that dividend from the holding company in the fourth quarter. Turning to capital, our preliminary statutory operating earnings for the third quarter of 2009 are approximately $1.3 billion after tax and our preliminary statutory net income is approximately $900 million after tax. That’s positive net income. You will note that these figures are significantly higher than our GAAP results. Many of the statutory reserve adjustments which we made six or nine months ago in a more difficult environment are now being reversed. So statutory earnings strength and its effect on capital is quite good.  Steve spoke a bit about ratings migrations in our investment portfolio and the potential impact that a change in methodology being proposed at the NAIC may have. While we are optimistic that there will be an adjustment on the risk-based capital charges, it is too soon to say how much that will be. Therefore, we may need to move some capital down to MLIC, our main life insurance company, to cover increased capital requirements. Because of all the moving pieces here, I’d hesitate to give you a dollar figure but I am confident that it is an amount the holding company will be able to comfortably afford.  In summary, the fundamentals of our business continue to be strong and we are continuing to succeed in this challenging market environment. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator so that we might take your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Tom Gallagher with CSFB.
Tom Gallagher - CSFB: First, just Bill, a follow-up on the interest rate related charge in the annuities. Would you describe this as something that is more accounting noise related to specifically the way the GMIB is accounted for? Or is this something that you think suggests you need to alter something on the hedge back in that product? That’s my first question. 
Bill Wheeler: I think I got that -- you’re breaking up a little bit. Hopefully we can fix that with the -- I think that’s a problem on our end. Is it accounting noise? It’s a little bit of both. I mean, think what happened this quarter -- we have pretty low interest rates in general to begin with and then we had a 50 basis point decline in what we would call new money [SPIA] rates, which are sort of an income annuitization rates, and the -- in the quarter, so you start from a low base and then you have a big move downward, which is pretty unusual. But there’s been a lot of unusual events over the last year. So that’s really what triggered it but I think what it highlighted was that sort of some of the assumptions we are using regarding annuitization rates may need to be adjusted in the future. Because these income annuities or these GMIBs, the first ones don’t even become available for an annuitization for a number of years yet and so we are a long ways away from having this -- having what I would say a real impact on our business. So probably some sort of smoothing makes sense here. And we will obviously be examining that over the coming weeks.  In terms of hedging now, this is really an issue more for the old GMIB block as opposed to sort of the new product, and so -- the old GMIB block, you know, we use sort of a combination of delta hedging of the equity exposure and then some re-insurance cover to handle things like GMBB and other issues. So there is some interest rate protection here. I don’t think we feel the fix here is to change our hedging strategy on this whole block. This has not been historically a very material -- had a very material effect on our financial statements. You know, we’ve had this hedging strategy in place, we’ve had this accounting in place, and it’s not triggered a very material move historically. So we’ve had some weird, fairly extreme interest rate move from a low base combined with -- you know, which sort of highlights maybe a change we might need to make for some of the assumptions. 
Tom Gallagher - CSFB: Got it, okay, that’s helpful. And the other question I had is just since we’ve had a pretty extreme tightening in the credit markets, I guess you’ve got two issues going on there -- one is I guess it becomes more difficult to put out new money but that is sort of the negative but the positive is I assume the potential financing markets for any possible transactions in terms of M&A suddenly looks more attractive. Can you address both of those issues in particular? Do you think this environment makes things more likely or interesting from an M&A standpoint?
Steve Kandarian: I think you were talking about putting money out, and spreads are in dramatically from where they were in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year but still above sort of normal spread levels in a growth economy. The issue in terms of yields is really interest rates are so low, so that’s what is really driving of course this unrealized loss number down dramatically, is tightening spreads and very low interest rates. So that does make it challenging in terms of getting yield but on the other hand, the spreads coming in show you that the markets are far less dislocated than they were a couple of quarters ago, so that’s obviously good news. 
Bill Wheeler: And with regard to is it a great time to do financing for deals, you know, unfortunately even -- our spreads have come in a lot, so it’s better than it was certainly but I wouldn’t call it -- I’m not sure I would call it ideal yet. I still think we -- I think still if you look at some of the spreads on our fixed income securities, I still think they are inappropriately wide but what do I know.  I think the equity -- the thing you have to keep in mind here, of course, is if this is a transaction of any size, it’s not only going to have a debt component, it will have a fixed income component or a hybrid component; it will have an equity component and valuations are not really stellar here. So in terms of -- so it all kind of depends on prices of potential targets and what sellers realistic expectations are, because we are still in a relatively low valuation marketplace for insurance stocks, or financial services generally.  So yeah, it’s a little better than it was, that’s for sure, but I wouldn’t call it ideal.
Tom Gallagher - CSFB: Thanks.
Operator:  Next we will go to the line of Eric Berg with Barclays Capital.
Eric Berg - Barclays Capital : Two questions -- first in the variable annuity business, I’d love to get, Bill, your perspective to build on that of the IR team’s -- with companies pretty much everywhere raising prices and reducing the strength of guarantees and my sense is that has happened not only in the withdrawal market but also in the income market, in short with the deal seemingly -- well, not seemingly just in fact not nearly as good as it had been for the [inaudible], what is happening with demand for variable annuities and where do you think demand is headed? And then I have one follow-up question. 
Bill Mullaney: I’ll respond to your question on variable annuities. You know, if we look at the market quarter over quarter, it appears that even though it is early, sales will probably be flat industry wide. They might be down a little bit quarter over quarter and so -- and we think it’s probably a good level of demand to think about from a marketplace perspective going forward. So we had a good quarter in terms of our level of sales. They came down a little bit over where we were in the year-ago period but we are writing business at good margins and I think the marketplace is coming back to the kind of products that I think not only provide good returns for the insurance companies but also provide good guarantees for consumers. So we think the marketplace is settling out in the right spot. 
Eric Berg - Barclays Capital : Okay, then my question is along the same lines in the life insurance area, I noticed that you had a big pick-up in sales of which you caption as traditional, which includes not only of course whole life but also term. As others, your universal life sales were down. It feels like for many, many months now the American public has been buying fewer policies, more term policies, smaller base amount policies -- that’s how it seems to me, that’s how it feels to me. What’s your sense and more importantly, where are we headed in terms of the future of sales in this industry over the next two years? What will be the complexion of the sales? Thank you. 
Bill Mullaney: I think on life insurance, your assessment on what is happening in the market is right. There has been more of a shift away from universal life and variable life into more traditional products like whole life and term and face amounts have been down.  You know, it will be interesting to see what happens going forward as the economy begins to pick back up. We may see a pick-up in life insurance sales. I am not sure you will see the same level of growth in the universal life markets as you have seen in the past, the number of companies, including us, have made changes to that product and I think that for the people who are buying life insurance today, they are looking for protection at a lower price and I think term insurance provides that. And I think in addition to that, we are starting to see a greater level of interest in whole life insurance, which I think is just a way from -- a move away from equity based products and I think that you are going to see that continue to be the mix for the foreseeable future. 
Eric Berg - Barclays Capital : Thank you. 
Operator:  Next we will go to the line of Suneet Kamath with Sanford Bernstein.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: Again, on the variable annuity business, I think Rob, in your opening remarks, you said that you were happy with the quality of the business that you are writing. Can you perhaps dimension how you are pricing this product from a return perspective and what sort of market environment you are assuming? Is that sort of our standard 2% equity market depreciation for the quarter or what would happen on the returns of this business if we kind of went through something similar to what we went through over the past 12 months, and then I’ll have another question. 
Bill Mullaney: In terms of the pricing on the current VAs, we have got the changes that we made in our product that we -- we made a couple of changes earlier this year in February and in May and so for our GMIB product, which comprised the vast majority of our sales in the third quarter at the 5% rollup rate, the returns are good. You know, the returns are in excess of our hurdle rate of 15% ROI, so we feel pretty good about the level of business that we are writing. The assumptions that we have used in this product are very similar to the assumptions that we have used in the past as it relates to equity market growth and so we were pleased with the level of sales that we had in the third quarter in our VA business, given the fact that we are using the product with the 5% roll-up rate and the fact that a couple of the companies that we compete against were out there with pretty hot products in the third quarter. Now, some of them are making some changes to their products to reduce some of the levels of their guarantees but we felt that we got a very good market share -- our market share, we don’t have the exact numbers but it will probably come in north of 10, probably in the 11% to 12% range and we think that that’s a pretty good market share, given the level of returns we were getting on the product and the market environment. 
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: That’s helpful -- I guess I want to come back, if I could, to that 15% hurdle rate that you talked about because clearly if we assume 2% market appreciation, that would -- I think most people would feel that that’s a pretty good environment versus what we have seen, so if you -- I am assuming when you price the product and re-price it, you stress tested it for a down market, kind of what we have been through or something like that. I’m just wondering if you are doing 15% plus in a kind of decent market, what’s the downside risk to that return based on the new product? Thanks.
Stanley Talbi:   The 15% [inaudible] return. We are still talking about [inaudible] a return on capital. The equity market returns assumed is kind of like a more normalized level and that is what he was saying was kind of consistent with last year. You know, it’s above 5 but it’s under 8. 
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: I got that, Stan. I guess -- I understood that he was talking about the return on capital. I guess my follow-up question was how bad could that return on capital get if we go through this market environment that we just saw. 
Stanley Talbi:   Obviously [it would go lower]. You know, it could go into the high-single-digits. I would say that the market turning down and then back up again doesn’t mean that we’ve locked in a lower return. It really depends on the longer term rates. So for example, the business that was sold in 2006, 2007 where the market ran up and then came back down again, it’s back up again. So the returns are looking much better on that business today. 
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: Okay, and then my second question I guess is on the comments about the RBC and the potential change to the residential mortgage backed security calculation of capital. I guess my question is how much -- how material of an event is this? I know you are not going to quantify it but just based on what I have been reading from the rating agencies, it seems like a lot of them are going to sort of look through this anyway and so from their perspective or from a capital redeployment perspective, if they are not going to give you credit for it, I’m not so sure that it changes things. I’m just wondering if that is the correct interpretation or am I missing something? Thanks. 
Bill Mullaney: I think if you look -- Moody’s put out a release on this and what they said was this doesn’t change our view about the economic fundamentals of those securities. And I would sort of -- which I would totally agree with. I mean, it’s not -- you know, the question really is is are those good securities, are they going to be money good or are we going to see defaults or impairments, and that is of course the real fundamental question and I think that was what they first wanted to get their point across.  If you read the Moody’s release down further, it did also say that we view this is going to provide capital flexibility to certain companies because they are not going to have this RBC charge, so if you had, for instance, any kind of test related to RBC, it’s going to be -- you know, it will be a good thing for you. So I found that to be a fairly benign public statement by Moody’s.  You know, to just take a step back from this a minute, the rating agencies have -- they have taken a bunch of securities which were rate triple A and they have now kind of in a blanket sort of way, kind of a back-up-the-truck kind of way rate them single B, okay? Now that’s not very impressive and I think -- and I think frankly, I would suspect if you asked the people who cover the insurance industry in the rating agencies as opposed to the structured credit people, they weren’t probably terribly impressed by that either. So that’s I don’t think an indication of economic reality about the basis of those securities and I think that was Steve Kandarian’s point. So this triggers effectively this phenomenon of going from triple A to single B, which triggers a capital tax, okay? And the regulators have recognized, jumped on this immediately with I don’t think a lot of prodding, even before they got any kind of commentary from the industry and said this just doesn’t make sense. And you know what, we should maybe do something which reflects reality a little better.  So I think the rating agencies are going to understand this and I don’t really -- the idea is not whether they get credit or not because I totally agree with the idea that look, the economic risk of these securities has not changed, no matter what somebody says they are rated, but it is causing kind of an arbitrary, somewhat false capital issue and that’s really the issue and I think they kind of get that. So I’m actually kind of hopeful that they will treat this the way it should be done.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. 
Operator:  Next we will go to the line of John Nadel from Sterne, Agee & Leach.
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: Good morning, everybody. I have a couple of real quick ones -- first, just to clarify, the impairments and credit losses this quarter, even those that you took on the hybrid side, both are running through statutory and GAAP similarly?
Steve Kandarian: Yes. 
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: Second one, Rob, I was interested -- you sort of -- I think you sort of changed your inflection when you talked about the quality of the variable annuity sales during the quarter and I wanted to come back to that. Obviously a lot of competition in the variable annuity space especially has come in and out and in and out of the market here over the past couple of quarters. You guys have been obviously stable players. Can you maybe expound on your comment there? I mean, I know you are not going to necessarily take shots at a particular company but can you give us a sense at what is going on in the marketplace and why you sort of -- why you highlighted the quality of the sales that you are making?
Rob Henrikson: Well, sure, John and yes, you are right -- I don’t like to take shots at people and I really don’t need to, other than focus on what the fundamental business is all about. You know, you probably -- lord knows I’ve been public enough about my feelings about business in general, even the market share horse race measured by sales and who’s hot this quarter and so forth and so on. You know, the sales at one end of the spectrum but you know, we’ve had a flight to quality, quite frankly. That has helped us with market share. That connected with disciplined underwriting with our very strong retention track record and our positive net cash flows tells me that on top of a strong financial base, and I might say all this business being written on a platform that has much better operating leverage because of what we are doing on the expense side, tells me that I feel very, very good about the health of our business. I have said over and over again, I love the variable annuity business. I am not in love with it, and I think people that come in and out, you know, they are in love and they are out of love and they got other things they have to worry about. We see it sometimes on aggressiveness in other product lines when somebody has a little bit of an adjustment on their variable annuity business, all of a sudden we see them popping up in institutional, writing literally unsustained business -- unsustainable business.  So we are here for the long run. We are looking at the health of our business. We are focused on our customers and we are focusing on our policy, on our shareholders and I feel good about that.  So quality, you know, quality is a word that sometimes gets discounted as kind of like oh, that’s mom and apple pie but if you peel back the onion and look at the quality, you have to look at all of these issues -- the growth in the assets, the positive flows, the retention possibilities, how you are pricing for it, what your reserving is, and so forth. And with all of that, I feel great. So other than that -- and the Yankees won last night. 
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: I feel great about that too. One last quick one, if I could, Bill, the tax rate appeared to be unsustainably low this quarter. I’m not sure if I’m reading that right. It’s a little bit more difficult when you are looking at it on a segment by segment basis but maybe you could go through that?
Bill Wheeler: No, we don’t think that effective tax rate is normal. It requires a little bit of explanation. You know, we just filed -- I forget, which tax return was it? I think -- we just filed -- yeah, it was last year’s tax return and when we did that, we had a true-up of our DRD credit, and you know, DRD is something we take every quarter and adjust for in our tax provision every quarter. But sometimes we have to true it up occasionally. So it’s -- I would say real earnings obviously that we would take credit for but it’s a little lumpy this quarter and so when you think about sort of the effective tax rate going forward, yeah, I don’t think 18.5% is the right number. But that’s because of the lumpy DRD credit we took. 
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: Yeah, and understanding that a lot of things move around on a quarterly basis, what’s a better -- is the long-term, longer term rate better look at the last couple of years to get a sense for that? I mean, the business mix hasn’t really shifted that meaningfully and maybe international is a little bit bigger now. 
Bill Wheeler: Yeah, I wouldn’t say -- the problem with -- of course, if you go back to 2007, we earned a lot of money in 2007 and so on every incremental dollar of profits, the tax rate is higher, it’s 35%. So as your earnings -- as our earnings levels get restored here, we will unfortunately enjoy a higher effective tax rate but I don’t know if it will go quite all the way back to where it was in 2007 until we get to that level of earnings again. 
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: Thank you very much. 
Operator:  Next we will go to the line of Jimmy Bhullar from J.P. Morgan.
Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan: I had a question first on ratings migration and capital -- as we look at your below investment grade bonds, those have actually obviously gone up a lot and specifically within that, your triple Cs are up about $2 billion, or triple Cs up about $4.5 billion actually, single B is up about $2 billion. And on that basis alone, if you are using a 350% RBC as sort of a target, the capital charge would be significantly over $5 billion, so obviously there are other offsetting factors, either it’s stat income or something else. But I was wondering if you could address -- you mentioned you can't precisely give us the amount but if you could address the amount of capital that you need to put into the subs with or without NAIC relief, and if you can't quantify it, just give us the range -- is it $1 billion to $2 billion, is it $3 billion or $4 billion? Is it higher than that? Just so people have an idea on how you will go about using the money that is sitting at the holding company. And then I have a follow-up after this. 
Rob Henrikson: I’m not sure I quite agree with your 5 bill, but I don’t want to downplay it. It’s material. Ratings migration is a material issue for us. 
Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan: That I’m basing just on the B and triple Cs going up by about $6.5 billion, if you apply the charge and assume a 350% RBC, if you sort of separate that out, it does give you a decent sized amount. 
Rob Henrikson: Fair enough, but it’s a big issue. My number is -- our numbers are south of that but they are not that much south in terms of the overall impact.  Obviously we start with a -- you know, remember, Jimmy, last year we had total RBC balance of 391 in sort of our consolidated RBC ratio across all of our insurance companies, so we started the year at a pretty substantial cushion relative to 350 and you know, even though we’ve had some realized losses this year, we have also had obviously pretty good stat earnings and certainly the second and third quarters were quite good. So I think there are other factors going on in terms of the RBC balances.  So to go back to your more specific question about well, come on, tell me how much it is that you might have to put down in cash, so let’s just go through the math. We talked about $5 billion of cash at the holding company. Now we are going to pay a $600 million common stock dividend, so the -- so certainly the RBC -- or certainly the cash at the holding company now is 4.4, call it. There’s some other ins and outs in the fourth quarter. They are not all that material. The holding company cash -- you know, I said this a month ago publicly and I wouldn’t mind saying it again. I don’t see how we are going to -- I don’t think we would put up half the cash even in kind of what I would say a fairly worst case scenario going down in the insurance subs, half the cash at the holding company. So you could say okay, half -- now that’s 2.2, okay? I actually -- my expected number is it’s going to be quite a bit less than that. But I hate to get more precise than that because we don’t know how effective this relief will be and -- or how extensive it will be and so we will have to -- so we will see it from there.  So when I go back to my statement I made in my prepared remarks, which is we think that our -- we are comfortable with the holding company is going to be able to deal with this issue and make sure that the insurance subs keep their RBC ratios above 350. 
Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then secondly I just had a question on your ROE -- obviously the returns are very high, even variable investment income was peaking. But if you could talk about what you believe your long-term ROE is based on your business mix and also what type of capital do you hold longer term versus what you held in the past? And then secondly, what do you believe it will be, or the range it will be in over the next couple of years? Because it would seem like 2011, the return might be depressed even worse as your lower long-term potential. 
Rob Henrikson: Let me start with the short-term and then we will think about the long-term. I think we’ve said previously that when we look out at 2010, even though we haven’t -- we are just now finishing our 2010 plan, financial plan, we have sort of -- my estimate is that we will end up at something like a -- you know, I said in shouting distance of 10% and I think that still sounds right.  But partially the reason it’s that number is we don’t think we are going to have any spring back recovery in things like variable investment income. You know, we are not assuming that’s going to bail us out next year. First, it’s hard to predict and second is that’s not -- we don’t really see those alternatives recovering that quickly.  Our current earnings plan or the 2009 earnings plan of 600 variable investment income included $600 million of variable investment income. Implied in that $600 million number is basically a 1% return on all our alternative asset classes. So that’s pretty weak, okay? You know, we did try to call the bottom here. We just didn’t quite get right about how severe it was. We’re not assuming I think that that’s going to recover very much in 2010, really if at all, and versus that assumption. And I think -- so that’s probably going to continue to hold down the ROE.  The other thing of course is, and we’ve talked about this a lot, is we are -- you know, we’ve been holding lots of liquidity in terms of cash and if you look at our treasury and agency holdings, they are also very healthy. And we have gradually been moving back into a fully invested state but I think that’s gradual and I don’t think that is going to necessarily reverse itself for a while yet until we really get what I would call fully invested. So that’s going to take a while but more to do.  So that’s probably going to hold down ROE in the near-term. I don’t think there is any -- but if you think about what sort of -- what has really changed fundamentally about our business, I would say not much. We are still -- 
Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan: Although the capital you will hold going forward will probably be significantly higher than what you have held.
Rob Henrikson: Well, you know, you say that -- I’m not sure why you think it. And I -- I’ll start practicing my speech with you guys. I think that if you look at the capital levels in the life insurance industry, never mind us, but the capital levels in the life insurance industry through what is the biggest financial crisis anybody can remember in living memory here that we have gone over the last 12 months, I think the insurance industry has held up incredibly well in terms of solvency ratios and tests and then certainly we have. And I think I would say that in general, I don’t necessarily think -- by the way, I don’t know if I would say that about the banking industry. I think banking capital levels may change a lot. I’m not so sure I would go look at what the experience of the last year and say oh well, obviously the insurance industry needs more capital. I think there will be a healthy discussion about this between regulators, rating agencies, and the industry. But I personally think when you kind of parse through it and you look at underlying capital levels and performance, I think we hold the right amount of capital given the risks we take and that is sort of what our economic capital and value of risk models tell us.  So will we have to hold a lot more capital going forward? That’s not my expectation, but we will see. But certainly -- so I’m not going to try to predict that in terms of how the effect that might have on ROE because I think it’s a very uncertain thing.  In terms of long-term ROE goals, I don’t think they have really changed for us. We hit a 15% ROE in 2007. Obviously that was a very strong variable investment income performance. We’ve been I think more aggressively managing expenses. That’s obviously going to also help margins and help returns a little bit over the coming years.  Will the industry buy back stock like it used to? Probably not. But will they maybe increase dividends more in the next three or four years? Maybe they will. So I think there are other ways to kind of think about how you manage capital levels going forward.  So I guess that’s kind of a long-winded rant way of saying I’m not sure much has really changed in terms of what we will have to hold for capital, what our -- you know, the amount of profitability we can enjoy going forward. It’s going to take us a while to get back to what I would say full speed ahead operating at 70 miles an hour again in terms of earnings power. You know, we are a good 12 months away from that, I think but --
Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan: The one thing I would add to that is obviously I think companies would want to have a little bit more of a cushion so that the industry went through this okay but a bunch of companies ended up raising equity on a significantly dilutive basis. A couple of them needed government help, so it might -- don’t you think management teams would hold a little bit more capital so that in a bad scenario, that they don’t have to go out to the market again? Or at least pull back on buying back stock as aggressively, as you saw in ’06, ’07? 
Rob Henrikson: Certainly I think on the margin, those things are going to be true. Will those -- will that really fundamentally alter ROE expectations in the industry a lot -- you know, really move it? I’m not sure. It might on the margin affect it a little bit but I don’t -- and how long will those sort of sentiments last about how much capital cushion people should hold over and above what they would normally think is appropriate, I -- you know, that’s hard to say. 
Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan: Okay, thank you. 
Operator:  Next we will go to the line of Colin Devine from Citigroup.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Just a couple of quick questions -- Bill, you touched on the cash and I certainly was surprised to see the cash balance rise this quarter when I thought you had been saying you were going to be spending it down and have you just changed where you are going to keep that? Secondly, on some of these possible NAIC RBC charges, it certainly strikes me that your bond department is pretty sharp and I think you knew the risk of what you were buying so I would be surprised if you need that to help favorably boost your RBC, certainly model those things as well as anybody. But there is something else that I think they are looking at as well and that’s a possible bright line for impairments on structure credit products. I was wondering if you could comment on that and what possible impact that may have on you because it would seem to me that could also go the other way.  And then lastly, Rob, you made the comment on the somewhat irrational variable annuity competitors but it is certainly our view that Met probably offers one of the most aggressive products in the market today with the dollar for dollar withdrawal feature on the GMIB, so -- and that’s really what’s been a key part of driving your strong sales. So how much have you really de-risked the products? I know they are down from 12 months ago, taking a 6% step-up down to 5% but aren’t they still considerably riskier than they were two or three years ago?
Bill Wheeler: I’ll start with cash levels. We are -- you know, for everybody’s benefit to level set here, we had $22 billion of cash and short-term. That was actually up $1 billion in the quarter versus the June 30 number. That’s a little deceiving. It just so happened right around year-end there was some sort of cash coming in the door that hadn’t quite -- or quarter end, I mean, that had been coming in the door that hadn’t got quite reinvested. It got reinvested within a week or so of the -- in what I think are pretty good spread assets. And that was roughly worth about $2 billion, so instead of cash being up a bill, it really when you kind of take into effect the sort of quarter end move, it was really down a bill.  Now, we hold about -- so call it sort of adjusted $20 billion cash and short-term balance, we have $3 billion that are backing -- that are collateral that are backing derivative positions, so that is obviously not what I would call true cash, so sort of real cash balance is more like $17 billion.  You know, we think normalized cash levels really here are really probably closer to 13 bill, so something like that. So we still have quite a bit of excess cash cushion and our expectation is we will get that reinvested. Now I don’t think it is going to happen necessarily in the fourth quarter. There’s some reasons why where some of the cash is tied up right now in certain portfolios and it’s not worth getting into why, but our expectation is that will get reinvested and we are not going to stay at sort of a net 17 cash billion forever. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Where do you think it will bottom out?
Bill Wheeler: Well, again I think -- I’m not talking about next quarter now but if you kind of look at history and maybe how the business has evolved a little bit over the past year or two, I think 13 bill is a good -- is a decent kind of bottom out target. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Okay. 
Rob Henrikson: Let me just start off by saying in terms of the irrational, I was trying to remember what I said in terms of irrational pricing. I said I thought I thought some people were doing things on an unsustainable basis. That comment was directly related to what we were seeing in the institutional side of the business, as you may recall when I said you know, we are seeing people that are in both lines of business that are being somewhat conservative and put all of a sudden on the other side, grasping for market share via sales. And in terms of the variable annuity business, my point there is that people fall in and out of love with a product. We’ve been here, we are going to be here tomorrow and the book of business is quite sustainable and also quite healthy. You know, as I look at everything other than just market share horse race from quarter to quarter, measured by sales only. In terms of the more specific question, I’ll pass it to Bill Mullaney. 
Bill Mullaney: Just to follow-up on the point you made about the product changes, yeah we did change the roll-up rate from 6 to 5 but we’ve done some other things around asset allocation and making the investments more restrictive, so that we keep -- people have to keep a fairly high percentage of their money in fixed. We’ve also increased pricing on some of the riders. You know, we understand the dollar for dollar issue. We’ve looked at that very closely. We modeled that out in -- and I’m make a couple of points. You know, first of all, we’ve got a pretty large stable block of GMIB business and what really influences dollar for dollar, as you know, is policy holder behavior and we have watched policy holder behavior very closely over the last several years and even during the economic crisis, policy holder behavior really hasn’t changed and it would have to change fairly dramatically in terms of people opting in for the dollar for dollar feature for it to have any real material impact. And when we do hedge this product and when we do charge the fees for the riders, you know, we model policy holder behavior to a certain extent into our strategy, so we feel as though we understand that risk fairly well and the structure of our product will give us the right level of protection. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Okay, and then there are questions for Steve Kandarian or Bill on the NAIC proposal for impairing structured credits. 
Steve Kandarian: I am not quite sure what you are referring to. I know obviously -- 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: They are looking at a bright line impairment once the structure breaks that you’ve got to write it down to market value. 
Steve Kandarian: I have not seen that so I really -- 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Okay. 
Bill Wheeler: You know, just to follow-up on that, under GAAP obviously the rules regarding GAAP impairments of structure products have really been refined to kind of deal with this issue, that if you break the buck, if you will, even on a structured product, you don’t necessarily have to write it down to what people think the market is. You have to write it down to where you think the loss is, or and obviously adjustments for interest rate losses versus real capital losses, so there is a lot of -- so our attitude is, of course, is that the -- you know, GAAP has really led the way here and of course in our minds, GAAP when we take an impairment for GAAP, we take it for stat as well, so the GAAP guidance has really been refined and I think reflects kind of good common sense now. So it -- my expectation is that will -- stat will stay consistent with that. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: There’s no plan to sort of run at a two-tier impairment methodology, one for stat, one for GAAP? It’s all the same [inaudible]?
Bill Wheeler: That’s correct.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Thank you.
Operator:  Your final question today comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein from Fox-Pitt Kelton.
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton: I guess just one clarification -- Bill, I know you didn’t want to go too far down this route but the way I interpreted your comment was if the NAIC relief did happen, that you might not need to put capital from the holding company down? Did I characterize that correctly?
Bill Wheeler: I mean, that’s possible. It depends on the extent of the relief, obviously so -- and it may not be a very material amount. I mean, it’s -- certainly at year-end, there’s always some moving pieces and we obviously have to do our -- you know, a lot of these RBC calculations are pretty complicated [inaudible] modeling and we have to do cash flow testing in our reserves and so there’s a lot involved. It’s just sort of right we don’t publish in RBC every quarter is because it’s really it’s quite an involved calculation. But -- and so there are a lot of moving pieces but I -- we’ve tried to estimate what the relief might be and there’s a range and if you are at the top of the range, I think you can squint your eyes and say we may not need to put anything down. But I don’t think that’s my middle-of-the-road expectation. 
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Okay, fair enough. I guess the question I would ask is -- I mean, I think that there’s a fair assumption that something does get passed but if it doesn’t, would you go down the [re-remic] route, and if not, why not?
Bill Wheeler: I’m looking at [Ken Baron], see if he will answer that question. I guess it’s on me. We certainly get pitched on a lot of people who would like to help us [re-remic] a bunch of stuff. There’s problems with it. One, it’s too expensive to do. Two, it’s -- we’re not sure that the accounting really hangs, okay, in terms of [re-remicing] certain securities. I mean, investment bankers love to tell you no, no, don’t worry about that. Of course, that’s the whole point is we do have to worry about it so there -- so I think we are not sure re-remicing is really a solution which works for us, though people do disagree about this, about the accounting impact. So I am not sure the re-remicing is the answer. 
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Okay, and then just a final question -- oh, was there another comment?
Steve Kandarian: Also remember in these [re-remics], there is a loss oftentimes taken up front, so there is some offset there in terms of the benefit. 
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Right. Final question, just the reserve adjustments that you mentioned, Bill, were those purely equity market related or were there other adjustments that were made that are kind of more permanent in nature and maybe not specific to equity markets, or even interest rates? And I guess what I’m getting at is if we have kind of another turn down, do we give back what we gained in stat income this quarter?
Bill Wheeler: Yes, if we have another 40% decline in the stock market, we’ll have to set up those reserves again, so they -- I mean, you know, a small downturn has no material impact. We are talking about -- remember what was going on with the S&P in December and at March, where it dropped as low as what, 660, so yeah, I mean, -- yes, the answer is when you have that kind of extreme move, the stat reserve adjustments will have to be adjusted again. 
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Okay, so no revisions to kind of underlying assumptions that are above and beyond macro assumptions?
Bill Wheeler: No. 
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Okay, that’s all I have. Thanks. 
Conor Murphy: Okay, everyone. Thank you.

Operator: Welcome to MetLife second quarter earnings release. (Operator Instructions) Before we get started I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time-to-time in MetLife, Inc.'s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife, Inc. specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Conor Murphy, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Conor Murphy: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2009 earnings call. We are delighted to be here this morning to talk to you about our results for the quarter. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplement, both of which are available at MetLife.com. Our reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment-related gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period, and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments we will take your questions and here with us today to participate in the discussion are Bill Mullaney, President of our U.S. Businesses and William Toppeta, President of International as well as other members of management.  With that I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Henrikson: Thank you Conor. Good morning everyone. During the second quarter MetLife generated very strong top line results. Premiums fees and other revenues increased to $8.4 billion which by the way is one of our highest quarters ever. Our operational earnings increased significantly over the first quarter earning $0.88 per share. Book value including AOCI improved by approximately 18% from the first quarter.  It is evident that our diverse mix of businesses and solid fundamentals have allowed us to perform well and continue to grow in this challenging environment. We are still experiencing a flight to MetLife and increased market share in many of our key businesses while importantly maintaining our pricing discipline.  Before I share our business highlights I would like to talk briefly about our recent decision to combine our Institutional, Individual and Auto and Home businesses into an integrated U.S. business organization. We have an incredible opportunity to leverage our capabilities and further drive growth as we enhance our product design and distribution and streamline our decision making process. This is an exciting time for our company as we build upon our strengths and seize opportunities in the market place.  This realignment was a significant outcome of our strategic review we have been telling you about since last summer. Another element of our strategy which we have discussed before is operational excellence. We are well on our way to achieving the significant cost savings we have targeted under this initiative.  Now let me provide some insight into the performance of our businesses. The Institutional business generated outstanding results as the top line grew 8% year-over-year to $4.3 billion. Our Group Life premiums fees and other revenues grew over 4%. Our non-medical health grew by 3%. Retirement and savings business grew 35%. We had higher close out sales, particularly in the U.K. where the market is improving. We also experienced a significant increase in structured settlement sales as we grew market share in this business.  Our Group Life and Disability Underwriting results were strong, though dental performance was disappointing with higher benefit utilization as a result of the ongoing economic uncertainty. Individual business after two challenging quarters generated some very positive results during the second quarter. Life sales were strong across all channels, up 27% sequentially though down 9% year-over-year. Annuity deposits increased year-over-year by 43% with a record $4.5 billion in variable annuity deposits and nearly $1 billion in fixed annuity deposits.  Annuity net flows on both fixed and variable annuities remained positive, $3 billion in total, and both are benefiting from declining lapse rates for the second consecutive quarter. In International, premiums fees and other revenues declined over the year-ago period due to the strength of the U.S. dollar though on a constant currency basis top line revenue was flat. In Latin America premiums fees and other revenues were down 6% on a constant currency basis.  We continued to have solid performance in the Asia Pacific and European regions. In Asia our premiums fees and other revenues were up 8% on a constant currency basis. In Japan there has been significant growth of fixed annuity deposits while variable annuity deposits have declined, reflecting a continuing shift in that market place. Our European premiums fees and other revenues were up 7% on a constant currency basis as our European region businesses continue to grow. Auto and Home had another strong quarter delivering earnings of $76 million, up 46% over the second quarter of 2008.  Now I would like to shift gears for a moment and talk to you about our capital strength and some related events in the quarter. Over the past several months I have been telling our clients, our shareholders and all of you that MetLife’s strong excess capital position, ample liquidity and leading market position set us apart in the life insurance industry.  As you know, MetLife participated in the Government stress test. We believe the assessment reinforces what we have said about our strong capital position. Let me just mention a couple of points. On the measure of total potential losses ours was the lowest of the 19 participants. Furthermore, the potential losses on our commercial real estate loan portfolio were also lowest at 2.1%, a fraction of the median at 10.6%. I point this out because commercial real estate mortgages continue to be a topic of discussion and we believe the stress test assessment supports our view that our underwriting differentiates us from other financial institutions.  On the measure of tier one common capital adequacy we were fifth strongest and remember we were also the only company of the 19 that did not participate in the TARP capital purchase program. Also in the second quarter we took the opportunity to further bolster our capital and issued an additional 1.25 billion in debt which was several times over-subscribed. All told, we continue to be confident that we have the financial strength to succeed now and over the long-term.  Looking forward, we will continue to leverage opportunities to build even a stronger company. We are proud of our initiatives to offer simpler, better products to our customers as they continue to seek trusted companies and quality products. For example, we recently launched our Simple Solutions variable annuity which offers easier to understand and lower cost benefits especially to those nearing or in retirement. These are being offered in banks, providing a new vehicle for financial advisers to help clients turn retirement assets into a stream of withdrawals they cannot outlive.  We have also commenced a co-branding pilot program with other major global financial firms. These efforts, among others, will allow us to maintain our leading market position as we continue to benefit from a flight to quality and increased market share. In summary, despite the uncertain environment MetLife’s businesses are performing well and with the recent realignment we are even better positioned to meet the needs of our clients and we have the capacity and financial strength to further solidify our leading position in the industry.  With that I will turn it over to Steve. 
Steve Kandarian :  Thanks Rob. I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter. First let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pre-tax variable income for the second quarter was zero which was below plan by $150 million or $102 million after tax and DAC primarily driven by negative real estate fund and corporate joint venture returns.  Real estate fund returns were negative due to the continued decline in property valuations. We estimate that property values have declined an additional 5-10% during the second quarter with an expected peak to trough total decline of about 40%. While corporate joint venture returns improved substantially from the first quarter they still remained negative during the second quarter.  On the other hand, income from our securities lending program continued to outperform plan. In addition, hedge fund returns continued to improve and were above plan during the quarter. However, we expect variable income will remain below plan for the remainder of the year.  Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses were $546 million, in line with the previous four quarters. Write down’s this quarter were $846 million. These write down’s were experienced across a variety of sectors including $248 million in corporate credit, $129 million due to the strengthening of the mortgage valuation allowance and $82 million in structured finance securities. Write down’s also included $325 million of partnerships and equity securities and $62 million of hybrid securities which were impaired because the length of time and the extent to which the market value had been below amortized costs.  Losses due to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting were $2.8 billion. This was primarily attributable to a $1.5 billion pre-tax loss due to the improvement in MetLife’s own credit spread and its impact on the valuation of certain insurance liabilities. For example, MetLife’s five year credit spread decreased 312 basis points. This reverses derivative gains in previous quarters that occurred when our credit spread widened. The remaining $1.3 billion loss was due to several factors that negatively impacted the valuation of our derivatives including higher Treasury yields which reduced the value of our interest rate swaps and floors, the weakening of the U.S. dollar which reduced the value of our foreign currency swaps used to hedge foreign denominated assets and the declining credit spreads which decreased the value of credit default protection we purchased for our corporate bond portfolio.  As I have discussed previously, while the decline in the value of these derivatives is reflected in our income statement, it is generally offset by a change in value of the hedged assets or liabilities. Gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities were $19.5 billion at June 30, down substantially from the $28.8 billion at March 31 as spreads declined across all sectors.  Next I would like to discuss our real estate related holdings. As of June 30 we held $41.8 billion of residential mortgage backed securities including $7.3 billion of non-agency prime and $3.4 billion of alt-a mortgage backed securities. As I discussed in the last earnings call, the ratings agencies have downgraded virtually all 2006 and 2007 vintage alt-a securities to below investment grade. As a result, 88% of our 2006 and 2007 vintage alt-a securities and 56% of our total alt-a portfolio is rated below investment grade at quarter end.  In addition, during the second quarter the ratings agencies downgraded non-agency prime securities. As a result, 32% of our non-agency prime holdings are now rated below investment grade. The remaining $31.1 billion of residential mortgage backed securities are AAA rated agency backed securities.  As noted on several occasions, we believe our non-agency RMBS portfolio has superior structure to the overall market. For example, 86% of our alt-a and 97% of our non-agency prime securities are fixed rate versus 35% and 51% for the market respectively. In addition, 90% of our alt-a and 51% of our non-agency holdings have super senior credit enhancement. Furthermore we hold no Option ARM mortgages as compared to the 29% for the alt-a market place.  At quarter end MetLife’s commercial mortgage portfolio was $35 billion. As of June 30, the portfolio loan to value increased to 63% based on our rolling, four quarter property valuation process or we estimate in the mid to high 60% range if all properties were revalued today. In addition, the debt service coverage ratio for the portfolio is a very healthy two times. Moreover, commercial mortgage delinquencies and losses remain minimal. We had no defaults in our U.S. portfolio during the second quarter and only one small default in our international portfolio in the amount of $6 million.  As I mentioned earlier we have strengthened our mortgage valuation allowance resulting in a commercial mortgage reserve of $435 million at June 30, up from $329 million at March 31. In addition, only $1.6 billion of the portfolio matures during the remainder of 2009 and $2.5 billion in 2010. We remain comfortable with this level of roll over and expect to refinance as a whole the vast majority of these mortgages as we refinance them at market rates.  Finally let me say a few words on our cash and short term holdings. As of June 30 our cash and short-term investments were $21.3 billion, down from $30.3 billion as of March 31. Over the course of the quarter we invested in a diversified portfolio of assets primarily including U.S. government securities, agency residential mortgage backed securities and investment grade corporate credit. The yield on these purchases, excluding the U.S. government securities and floating rate securities was approximately 5.65%.  In conclusion, while we have seen some stabilization in the financial markets we remain defensively positioned and are cautiously reinvesting our liquid assets. With that I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler. 
Bill Wheeler :  Thanks Steve and good morning everybody. MetLife reported $0.88 of operating earnings per share for the second quarter. This morning I will walk through our financial results and point out some highlights as well as some of the unusual items which occurred during the quarter.  We had premiums fees and other revenues of $8.4 billion. This represents an increase of 3.5% as compared to the second quarter of 2008. Adjusting for the impact of exchange rates had on international’s reported revenues, MetLife’s premiums fees and other revenues would have been up by 6.2% as compared to the second quarter of 2008. I think that is an excellent result in this environment.  Institutional’s revenues were up 8% as compared to the second quarter of last year. This was primarily due to strong U.K. pension close out and structured settlement sales. Group life grew 4.1% and non-medical health grew at 2.9% as compared to the second quarter of last year. International had reported revenues of $1 billion in the second quarter compared to $1.2 billion in the year-ago period. Changes in exchange rates had a significant impact on reported revenue. On a constant dollar basis revenue would have actually been flat with the second quarter of last year.  Turning to our operating margins, let’s start with our underwriting results. Underwriting experience was generally favorable this quarter. In Institutional, group life mortality of 91.3% was well within our guidance range of 91-95% and flat with the prior year. In non-medical health and other, group disability morbidity ratio of 87.6% for the quarter was better than our target range of 89-94% driven by continued stable incidents. We saw higher claims utilization in dental but that was largely offset by favorable results in other non-medical health products.  Individual’s mortality ratio of 74.9% is significantly more favorable than our plan, driven by lower claim frequency. Individual’s underwriting results were favorable this quarter across all life products. Turning to Auto and Home the combined ratio including catastrophes was 93.5% down from the 99.5% experienced in the second quarter of 2008 due to lower catastrophes in the current quarter. Included in this result is a non-cash prior accident year reserve release of $3 million after tax compared to a $26 million after-tax release in the same period of last year.  Moving to investment spreads, with regard to variable investment income as Steve just explained, we again saw mixed performance of certain variable alternative asset classes this quarter. We experienced negative returns in real estate funded corporate joint ventures. Securities lending margins were strong and hedge funds performed well with returns on both asset classes coming in above plan. For the quarter variable investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $102 million or $0.12 per share lower than the 2009 plan.  Moving to expenses, our overall expense level was higher this quarter but that was driven by higher pension and post retirement benefit costs. Pension and PRB expenses were approximately $100 million pre-tax higher than in the second quarter of 2008. As I mentioned last quarter we expect our pension and post retirement benefit costs to increase by approximately $300 million in 2009 mainly due to weaker investment results.  Also in this quarter we incurred $33 million pre-tax in operational excellence charges which consist mainly of severance payments and some consulting payments. Our operational excellence initiative is progressing well. Related expense reductions were approximately $75 million in the second quarter which annualized to a current run rate savings of $300 million.  Finally, also in the expense line the equity market improvement of over 15% and interest rate movements in the second quarter increased earnings through lower back amortization in individual business by approximately $58 million after-tax or $0.07 per share.  Turning to our bottom line results, we earned $723 million in operating income or $0.88 per share. With regard to net investment gains and losses, in the second quarter we had net investment losses of $2.6 billion after tax. Our derivative losses were $1.8 billion after-tax and as Steve mentioned the largest portion of that result was a $1 billion loss after tax by the tightening of MetLife’s own credit spread.  Our preliminary statutory operating earnings for the second quarter of 2009 are approximately $1.1 billion which is very good and our preliminary statutory net income is $530 million. Our results this quarter include the adoption of a new FASB pronouncement for the recognition of other than temporary impairments of debt securities. This is FAS 115. Under this guidance, the credit loss or the portion of the decline in value that represents the reduction of expected cash flows is included as a charge to net income while the remainder of the decline in value or the non-credit portion is recognized within accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). As a result of the transition adjustment required by the guidance, equity as of April 1 was increased by $76 million after tax and DAC with a corresponding reduction due AOCI.  This transition adjustment represented the non-credit portion of previously reported other than temporary impairments on debt securities. For the second quarter of 2009 the other than temporary impairments of debt securities in total were $566 million on a pre-tax basis of which $332 million was included in realized investment losses while the remaining $234 million was recorded in other comprehensive income. So again the FAS 115 adjustment would have been $234 million.  In summary, the fundamentals of our business continue to prove strong and we continue to succeed in this challenging market environment.  With that let’s turn it over to the operator so we can take your questions.   
 :
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan. 
Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan: First, on your cash balances they went down $9 billion from the first quarter’s $21.3 billion. I just wanted to get an idea on where you think normal cash balances will be a year or two years down the road and how fast do you expect to get there? The second question is on your variable investment income. I think Steve mentioned it is unlikely to be below the $150 million run rate or the guidance for the year but versus the quarter you just reported how should it improve? What are the asset classes that could get better or what could get worse whether hedge funds or real estate? Finally, on your derivatives losses if you could give us an idea on how much you have left in derivatives gains that could reverse over time if spreads were to go back to let’s say where they were a year ago? How should we think about that number repeating in the third quarter again? 
Steve Kandarian :   I will take the first two questions you posed. The cash balances are likely to drift down lower over time. I don’t have an exact number or projection for you. It really is something we look at very closely with current market conditions. Obviously with all of the changing dynamics in the market place it is very hard to predict this. So, as you know we have been very cautious. We stayed liquid in the first part of the year here beyond what we would normally do. We have sort of gone back into the credit markets gradually over the last few months. So I don’t have an exact number for you but we certainly are reinvesting now in more normal array of assets compared to earlier in the year and late last year.  Regarding the variable investment income, I think there are some pluses and minuses likely to occur here over the course of the year. That really is a guess because it is very hard to predict what is happening or what is going to happen in the credit markets and the financial markets in general. For example, if the stock market continues to perform reasonably well through the remainder of the year we would expect our hedge fund returns would remain fairly strong which they were in the second quarter compared to the two quarters previously.  Private equity funds in that kind of environment would probably be going sideways pretty much. I don’t see a lot of big realizations in this market place in the near-term. At least we wouldn’t see as many write down’s as we saw in the previous couple of quarters; Q4 of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. We do think that the real estate fund area is likely to remain weak. It tends to be more of a lagging indicator than some other sectors so we anticipate that sector to be weak for the remainder of the year.  Again, all those comments are caveated based upon what happens in the markets in general. If we see a real rally in the markets even beyond what we have seen to date then those numbers will improve. If we see the market sell off dramatically then obviously the numbers will come down pretty sharply as well. Lastly what I would mention is our securities lending program is currently about $22 billion at quarter end, up from about $20 billion the previous quarter. With a relatively steep yield curve it is a fairly attractive business once again for us. The profits there are strong. Obviously the balances are far less than they were at one time when we saw balances in the mid $40 billion range, actually peaking at about $50 billion.  We don’t see those kinds of balances any time in the foreseeable future. 
Bill Wheeler :  With regard to derivatives I’m going to answer your question this way. If you look back at our derivatives gains and losses let’s say since the beginning of 2008 we on a net basis have derivative gains. Just two quarters ago, obviously we had a very big derivative loss this quarter, but two quarters ago we had an equally big derivative gain. Now obviously a lot of that is driven by on credit which is not cash and obviously it is really sort of accounting noise if I am allowed to say that. It doesn’t affect capital or anything.  The other derivative gains there might be a cash settlement component to it. So if you look over the last six quarters we really had derivative gains. Another way to think about this is in our cash balance that Steve talked about, the $21.3 billion this quarter, in that there is about $3 billion related to collateral mainly on the settlement of derivative contracts so we are still way in the money on a lot of our derivative positions.  So there is room. Of course, remember and keep this in mind, derivatives are hedging something. If derivatives keep going down some other part of our balance sheet is improving, probably AOCI, probably the bond portfolio but sometimes it is liabilities so that is something we feel good about. 
Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan: Could you just give us a number on your stat income, if you have an estimate for the second quarter? 
Bill Wheeler :  It was in my remarks. Our stat net income was $530 million which is an estimate still. It is not final. Our stat operating income was $1.1 billion which is quite good. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally – Morgan Stanley. 
Nigel Dally – Morgan Stanley: In the past you have talked about the potential EPS power of the company being in the range of $4.25 to $5.00 but with the caveat that it would take time and perhaps significant time with respect to alternative investments to return to that level. Any change in your view of that longer term EPS potential following these results? Secondly, Steve with realized investment losses earlier in the year you talked about potential losses of 1% of general account assets. The results in the first half of the year are certainly consistent with that. Is that still a good number for the back half of the year and any reviews for 2010?
Bill Wheeler :  I will certainly give you my opinion about the variable investment but probably Steve is the right person to talk to. I think it should recover next quarter. But Steve might be a little more cautious than that. I’ll let him comment on that. 
Steve Kandarian :  On the losses for the remainder of the year, again as I mentioned under variable income it is really hard to project when you don’t really know quite what this market is going to be doing quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month or even day-to-day. The 1% number we have used I think is a pretty good guide for our estimate for the remainder of 2009. I think it is still in the early days to say too much about 2010 but we will certainly talk about that at Investor Day. So much of this depends on the overall economy, consumer sentiment, policies in Washington, impacts upon markets, psychology of markets and so on. It is very difficult to predict. I think we can say that the 1% number that we have used, Bill and myself, in the past is a pretty good guide here. 
Bill Wheeler :  Maybe I misunderstood your question a little bit. I don’t think actually in terms of that little public exercise we went through about foreign [inaudible], that sort of assumes that eventually VII is going to recover which we obviously think it will and then eventually we will get fully invested and we will invest in spread assets. The timing of that, I think as I said then and I would still say, as you just heard Steve repeat, I think the timing is we will have to see. The momentum is going the right way but we will have to see about how quickly we do that. 
Nigel Dally – Morgan Stanley: If I could just follow-up on the investment portfolios. Below investment grade holdings continue to see some adverse ratings migration. What is the risk if you continue to face adverse ratings migration going forward that some of those assets will not be able to be admittable for statutory purposes pressuring your capital?
Bill Wheeler :  I think we are far below any kind of limitations there with regard to the ratings migration. I am kind of hoping. Maybe it is just wishful thinking that the ratings migration may be over but maybe not. We will find out. I think obviously just the mere fact there is a ratings migration creates a capital charge. The way to think about that or the way I encourage people to think about that including our colleagues in the rating agencies is obviously by downgrading a bunch of securities that we thought we were investing in at AAA they have caused a capital drag. But it is temporary. Eventually we will work our way through that. It will take a couple of years. In our case, of course, as Steve just talked about, we think the securities are money good. But it is a capital tax they have created if you will. We will work our way through it.  In terms of whether or not we are up against any statutory limitation I don’t think we are very close. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein. 
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: On the variable annuity business obviously your results there are some of the strongest we have seen so far in the quarter. I just want to talk a little bit about risk management. I think in the past you have said that one of the reasons you like the VA business is you have all these other businesses that form this diversification. How do you think about how much capacity you have to write new VA business? It just seems like you can kind of write as much as you want in this environment given your market share. How should we think about that? The second question is a numbers question on the capital. Bill you provided the stat numbers in terms of earnings but do you have an RBC estimate as of the second quarter and then is the $5 billion of excess capital you have talked about in the past still a good number to use? 
Rob Henrikson :  Let me start off by saying, and I know you would understand this but just so everyone understands, I do love the variable annuity business. It is something that is easier to love if you are well diversified and have multiple sources of earnings and you can spread your risk. However, I would say as a caveat there that is under the assumption you are properly designing and pricing your products in the variable annuity business. The way you phrased the question I just want to make sure that people didn’t think that I was ever saying that because we are in other businesses we can have one that we don’t pay attention to because we are very comfortable with the way we manage our variable annuity business.  I am happy with obviously our increased market share. It is very unusual to see your market share double in a period of a couple of quarters. Whether or not we can maintain that market share will be dependent on what happens to others in the market and so forth. Am I comfortable with the market share we have? Yes. I don’t know it would be wise to predict you would continue to hold a market share of 17-18%. I think that is to be determined.  Bill might want to add more specifics. 
Bill Wheeler :  Obviously in terms of just a risk management point of view we want diversification in how we make money. We make a lot of money. Obviously the VA business has a lot of earnings power and a lot of earnings potential to it. My feeling is that is probably all the equity exposure we want. But we will see. With regard to RBC, I think just for everybody’s benefit, we don’t calculate the RBC every quarter. It is only done once a year. The reason for that is it is actually a very complicated calculation. There is lots of [stochastic] modeling which gets done. We do not do that every quarter. I don’t want to pretend like we don’t think about RBC every quarter because we obviously do and we do some short hand calculations to make sure we have a good sense of what is going on with our capital ratios but it is not a number I think is ready for prime time. We won’t disclose an interim estimate number because that is not something I am frankly comfortable with.  The capital levels, there is a lot of tension in what’s going on with capital right now. You have got rating securities migration which is obviously a drag. We just talked about that. You have got state regulatory relief which is up in the air about which we had some state relief for sub-par in some states, not New York frankly, that happened this year and who knows what will happen later in the year when that stuff has to get renewed. You have got an environment which frankly is much better than it was at year end in terms of where the stock market is and where interest rates are and that helps your [stochastic] modeling frankly, your [C32] calculations and such.  So in general I feel like our RBC ratio has probably come down from year-end probably driven really from credit migration but frankly the earnings that we had this quarter were quite good. The same thing you should remember is what is not included in any of those calculations is the $5.2 billion of cash that is sitting at our holding company right now. So I feel like it is hard for me to be real precise about what an excess capital number is but I think we still have quite a bit of excess capital and I think we are frankly, I know we all feel better now maybe than we did a couple of months ago, but I think we have plenty of capital to kind of meet any challenges which we think might be coming up over the next period of time.  That probably is about as strong an answer as I can give you. 
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: When you used to talk about the $5 billion of excess capital last quarter did that include any of that cash at the holding company? If so, how much? 
Bill Wheeler :  It did. It would have included all of it except we have a rule of thumb that we want to have $750 million of cash at the holding company at all times so I don’t call that excess. So it would be anything north of that. We have added to the cash pile since March 31. Rob referenced the debt deal we did in the second quarter for $1.25 billion. We also did a hybrid deal right at quarter end. I think it actually technically closed right after the quarter for $500 million. We obviously burned a little cash from interest payments and stuff like that at the holding company. There is more cash at the holding company but there is probably also a lower RBC ratio because of continued credit migration. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach. 
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: Rob, I was hoping you could give us a little more color on the rationale for the organizational changes. Maybe specifically I think there have been some in sort of the outside investor community who might believe we should read something into that about positioning the company organizationally for some M&A. Any comments there? 
Rob Henrikson :  Actually the organizational realignment had nothing to do with M&A whatsoever. Remember, it was the outgrowth of our strategic initiative that we have been focused on for the last couple of years. The purpose of the reorganization, if you look at it from the standpoint of you may recall I talked about our focus was on decision making. That decision making and the streamlining of it has moved forward at just a wonderful pace. What you are seeing if you look at our businesses and the opportunities we have, that streamlined decision making gives us a better, quicker way to enhance product design and distribution. It give us better ways to recognize contingent space growth opportunities. It preserves the distribution channels we have that are so very important to us. We are very fortunate to have a very, very strong management team that this organizational team allows to lever up even greater. It has nothing to do with M&A at all. I would only say that to the point you have better streamlined decision making and better leverage of talent that would allow you to be clearer, smarter and more progressive in your thinking in everything you do including analyzing M&A opportunities. 
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: Bill, maybe going at Nigel’s question in a little bit different tact. Obviously operating earnings rebounded nicely from first quarter results but if we look at sort of the absolute level the ROE this quarter annualized was about 8%. I know there is some meaningful drag on that ROE, the higher cash balances, variable investment income and the like, but I would be interested in your thoughts assuming reasonable markets on how long it takes for that ROE to get back to sort of the low double digit range? Maybe with your existing business mix and again assuming reasonable markets, where can that ROE go longer term? 
Bill Wheeler :  It is certainly my expectation, and again with your caveat of reasonable markets, we are going to be within shouting distance of a 10% ROE next year. That is not assuming any dramatic recovery. That is just putting money to work and stuff like that. I think in terms of obviously I think it can improve from there. I think the tension, and I’m not sure how this will play out, to kind of get back to sort of I would say a mid-teen’s ROE in our industry you have to manage capital. [That means] just to buy back stock. Okay? That means you have to run a relatively efficient capital level. You don’t have to be real tight but you can’t just stock pile capital. You have to manage it. I don’t see how you really get to a 15% ROE, certainly some businesses can but given our current business mix I don’t see how you can get there without some capital management effort.  I would say this for Met but I would say this for the industry as well, I think it is going to be a number of years before we really start thinking about capital management again. It could be because we are going to want that capital for other purposes. Frankly given where our growth rate is right now we may need to deploy that capital just based on current internal growth. There is obviously maybe other opportunities to redeploy capital other than just buying back stock but you can’t count on that. I think we can continue to move the ROE up as the economy recovers. I feel pretty comfortable about that. Where we feel three years from now and the way to move it up further is really by driving more aggressive capital management. I think that is yet an open question. 
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: One quick follow-up on putting capital to work for Bill Mullaney, obviously a little a bit more activity here recently in the pension close out business. I am wondering what that business and the pipeline and activity especially relative to bigger transactions might look like? 
Bill Mullaney :  Let me just give you a little color on what we are seeing in close outs. Obviously we have two close out businesses, one here in the U.S. and one in the U.K. The U.K. business has actually been pretty active and we did a couple of sizeable deals this quarter. I would say within the U.K. they are even farther along than the U.S. in terms of thinking about close outs, positioning their portfolio for potential close outs, so I don’t think the portfolio got as hit when the equity markets declined. Remember, I think you have a better funding status in the U.K. So therefore, I have also seen some competitors pull back in the U.K. which I think has made it a better pricing environment for us so we are able to write some good deals at some attractive returns. We continue to have lots of discussions in the U.S. with plan sponsors who are thinking about close outs. I would say the decline in the equity markets has certainly made everybody realize what the impact of equity market volatility has on funding status. So I think as fundamentals recover there will be a great interest and demand in terms of moving some of those liabilities off the balance sheet.  As Bill talked about before, we do have excess capital and we are prepared to put that excess capital to work on some deals where we can get some attractive returns. 
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: As a follow-up, in terms of how much capital that business takes can you give us a sense like $100 million close out, how much capital needs to support that? 
Bill Mullaney :  It is really very much a function of the structure of the deal so if you have true non-par deals you might have a capital percentage that could be in the 10% range. If you had separate account deals or par deals the capital structure would require something less than that. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Ed Spehar – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. 
Ed Spehar – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch : I wanted to go back to the ROE question and back to the presentation you had done on your earnings thought experiment. If we look at the second quarter of $0.88 I think that the amount you put back to work in terms of cash balances is roughly in line with what you had highlighted as the low end in that presentation. If we just assume that you only had half the benefit in the quarter maybe you got another $0.05 from what you did so we are up to say $0.93. I think you said you had $75 million of expense saves in the quarter so $300 million annual. Is that correct? 
Bill Wheeler :  That’s right. 
Ed Spehar – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch : So we are right at the midpoint then in terms of the expense save number that you highlighted in that presentation as well. The only thing that isn’t there is variable income and conveniently it is zero this quarter versus the low to high that you modeled. I guess what I’m wondering is if you take that $0.93 and you annualize it you are at sort of a $3.70 to $3.75 number. What else can you do from that number to get the ROE up other than variable income and capital management? 
Bill Wheeler :  I think I would probably quibble with your ROE investing, have we already shot our wad if you will with regard to how much cash we have invested and how much more we have to go. We have made some progress in terms of reinvesting cash but we are a long ways from, you know if you just go back and look at our QFS four or five quarters ago we are running about a $10 billion cash balance a quarter. We are at $21 billion now and you can’t just say okay there is $11 billion excess there. It is not quite that simple. We have a long ways to go in terms of I think cash efficiency and then you heard Steve say in his remarks where he put most of the money this quarter was in Treasuries and agencies which is better than yielding and cash but hardly what I would call a full-spread asset. So I think there is opportunity there as well.  In terms of the recovery on VII, I don’t want to get too hung up on this because look it is not something we can control obviously. Private equities will come back when they come back. We have $8.3 billion in alternatives and we are not making much on that today at all. Even in the second quarter. I think there is a lot of power there over and above $0.88. So I don’t want to try to follow the math on the phone so maybe we can follow-up on the phone but I think there is a lot of earnings power that is sort of sitting there that is not really engaged yet.  Then of course we are growing the business at the same time. Oh yeah, we are doing that as well. I will tell you it is not just revenue growth. If anything the GAAP revenue growth probably understates how good this quarter was because a lot of the money is coming in as deposits. Then the margins that this stuff is getting put on is quite good. Then just to pile on a little more I don’t know if I quite followed all your expense math but I think maybe you got it right. I’m not sure. We are obviously not done in terms of expense improvement here. Operational excellence is obviously a nice kick. If our pension costs are really high, if we get any kind of rally in the equity markets that just starts to come down and unfortunately all the good work that we are doing in terms of OpEx are being masked by some unusually high pension and post retirement benefit costs. So probably the earnings kick there is probably even a little greater than maybe we have estimated before. 
Ed Spehar – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch : Your comment about capital management being a number of years away, share buyback being a number of years away, perhaps for the industry and for you. Have you had any discussions or thought about the trade off in saying would it work if we kept $20 billion in cash balances and when the time was right we reduced the allocation to alternatives and as an offset would the rating agencies then be comfortable with whatever now is considered to be in excess of the appropriate amount of cushion and capital to knock that down? Can you tradeoff between the cash and investments and alternatives with the potential to buy back the stock sooner? 
Bill Wheeler :  That is an interesting question. I don’t know. I think what your question really highlights is all that stuff is very much in the air yet. I don’t think the industry or really the analysts who follow this industry are really settled, or the rating agency obviously too, are really settled on the way forward here. I think it could very well be at the end of the day we will learn to evaluate insurance companies by all the excess cash that is sitting in their holding company and they will view that as the excess capital component and then we will take that off the top and then think about ROE after that. That may be how things progress. We will see. I just think it just feels like it is a little soon to be putting out new aggressive ROE targets when I really don’t know if two years from now capital management is really going to be in the cards. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Colin Devine – Citigroup. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: First, on variable annuities I appreciate the very strong sales. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of what percentage of those are the GMIB products which I think Bill rescored last quarter you don’t do as much hedging because the gap volatility it creates. Also what percentage for 1035’s because it is certainly my sense the number for that industry has come way down and so we are actually seeing a lot of new customers come in? On the investment portfolio, I appreciate on page 40 you break out the quality by NEIC ratings but that is on a fair market value and I wanted to get a sense of how much jump on up sequentially in the quarter on an amortized basis, particularly as we look to that rapidly growing NEIC 5 category and what that may mean for losses over the second half of the year? Lastly, it is my recollection you had put on several billion of interest rate hedges and that you had planned to take them off in the second quarter. Where did they come through in earnings if that is correct? Lastly, what happened on the traditional life line? 
Bill Mullaney:  I will start on the VA question. I would say on our sales for GMIB this quarter about 85%. So it is pretty consistent with what we have seen in prior quarters. In terms of 1035 exchanges we don’t have that exact information but what I will say is we know the 1035 exchanges are down. We are seeing some benefit from 401K rollovers which is actually helping us from a sales perspective. 
Steve Kandarian :  On the downgrade, it is about $2 billion of downgrades on an amortized cost basis for the quarter. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: I’m actually trying to get a sense for if we look sequentially on an amortized cost basis what are your jumps on aggregate to at the end of the second quarter and what do they aggregate to at the end of the first? I have the fair market at 14.8 and 18.3 but amortized costs would be more helpful. That was up $2 billion? That is what you are saying? 
Steve Kandarian :  $2 billion was a number I was giving you about the downgrades. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: I was just trying to separate how much of the increase is just spreads tightening as to how much is what else is going on there? 
Bill Wheeler :  They are looking through a folder. While they do that let’s talk about interest rate derivatives. Actually I don’t think we are talking about the same thing. We said we took off some of our interest rate hedges that we have. By the way, these tend to be very long interest rate swaps or floors that are used to hedge certain liabilities. For instance, we have minimum interest rate guarantees. We hedge to protect ourselves against the Japan scenario. Interest rates dropped a ton right at the end of the fourth quarter so a lot of these hedges, these derivatives were way in the money and that gain, that derivative gain, shows up in our income statement in the fourth quarter.  What we did was we said certainly our feeling is interest rates are going to go back up. There is a ton of value here. Are we just going to let it slip through our hands and watch the hedge move against us? The answer is we chose to kind of split the difference and we took $1.5 billion of pre-tax gains off the table. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Just to jump in for a second, so the mark to mark in losses we saw this quarter were net against those gains? 
Bill Wheeler :  Remember the mark to market occurs…
Colin Devine - Citigroup: I want to know where the gain is. How much was it and where is it? 
Bill Wheeler :  By the way we unwound the derivative and pocketed the cash. The gain occurred in the fourth quarter. We pocketed the cash in the first quarter. So if we hadn’t pocketed that cash our derivative loss, because obviously it was the right decision because interest rates moved back up and our derivative loss would have actually been greater. So most of that, not all of it, but most of that $1.5 billion of gain would have shown up as a higher derivative loss both in the first quarter and in this quarter. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Okay, I thought you were taking some off in the second quarter from what you told us before. 
Bill Wheeler :  I think it was first. We did it. That was the easiest $1 billion we ever made. So I think it was a smart thing to do. I would say that is a highly unusual event for us and it is not something we would repeat on a normal basis. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Then the traditional life line seemed to be unusually weak whether it was higher expenses or higher benefits. What was that? 
Bill Mullaney:  In terms of what was going on with trad life it really was driven by a couple of things. First of all we had a change in our DAC modeling so we took a pretty big charge for DAC in the first quarter on traditional life. We actually had a reverse on variable and universal life so you will actually see some of the gain show up there. Secondly, some of the earnings on the closed block going forward are going to be lower than what you have seen in the past because of some changes we have had to make in agreement with the state and the glide path around the earnings for the closed block. So those are really two reasons why trad life earnings were down over prior year. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: That is the first time I think we have seen a significant change to somebody’s DAC on traditional life. I know we are all getting tired of watching variable annuities going up and down. But it is a whole different matter on trad life. Was that just low interest rates that drove that? 
Bill Mullaney :  I’m going to ask Stan to talk some about the changes that we made around the DAC model. 
Stanley Talbi :  It had more to do with our closed blocks. We have a DAC model in our closed block that reflects expected gross profits. We had been negotiating at year-end with New York State on the operation of the closed block and our pattern of earnings was changing. Not in total, that doesn’t change. The assets are locked into the closed block. The future earnings are the same but the timing changed. We revised our model to reflect that change in the timing. So that resulted in a one-time DAC adjustment in the second quarter. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Was that also persistency driven? I notice lapses are hitting your record. 
Stanley Talbi :  No it was not persistency driven at all. 
Steve Kandarian :  Let me get back to your question. The reason we are struggling a little bit is the spread tightening of the market value number basically and I know there was a bid value number so we are trying to make them all tie up. Roughly it is 50/50 of spread tightening increased that number and below investment grade and the rest was downgrades. There was a little bit of net selling in that category as well. 
Operator:  The final question will come from the line of Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton. 
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Firstly a clarification. Have you updated your estimate of expense saves based on some of the recent actions and if so what are they? 
Bill Wheeler :  For everybody’s benefit we put out a target on investor day, maybe a little earlier, $400 million of expense saves related to operational excellence and we said $400 million pre-tax related to operational excellence and by the end of 2010. There are obviously besides operational excellence obviously other things going on in the expenses so I gave you a little color on pension costs. Certainly the fact that the stock market rallies and therefore our pension costs go down next year has nothing to do with operational excellence. So we don’t try to take credit for that. So when we were throwing around a number like $600 it is stuff like that as well. The number that I quoted in my remarks that we had $75 million roughly of expense saves this quarter implying a $300 million run rate, that is keeping score on OpEx. So you can see we are close even though it is second quarter of 2009 we are relatively close or bearing down on our OpEx goal that we had for the end of 2010.  We are way early and things are going well. We have not updated our OpEx target number and I don’t expect to now and there is obviously a lot of momentum so stay tuned. 
Rob Henrikson :  If you were asking whether or not the recent organizational change was counted in our OpEx numbers it was not. The reasons is primarily the focus on the organizational change is one about growth and leveraging capabilities and market strength and so forth and so on. I can assure you, however, that will not cause the number to slow down in terms of our reaching our objectives. I just thought I would mention that. I couldn’t tell from your question whether or not that was embedded in your question. 
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Yes that helps. On the VA sales in the quarter were those all off of the new pricing or were there still some lingering old prices that helped drive the sales growth? 
Bill Mullaney :  For the most part they were off the new pricing. We did some pricing changes in February and in May and we also made some product changes too and so while there may have been a little run up in sales prior to the pricing change we brought the guarantee on the GMIB down to 65. By and large it was done on the new pricing and for the most part on the new product. 
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton: On the International business can you just talk quickly about Latin America? It looks like on a constant currency basis premium would have been down. I know that is kind of more Mexico driven but can you just talk about the dynamics in that and how we should think about that? 
Bill Toppeta :  I would say that Latin America is actually holding up pretty well in terms of the top line and the reasons why we have seen some downturn, first of all there is the FX question. The Mexican peso drives a lot of what we do and that has been weak compared to the U.S. dollar. Then we get to the substance of it. You have to remember that in the prior year we had the Argentina pension business which at the end of last year was seized by the Argentine government so all of that revenue obviously goes away. In Chile we are in the payout annuity business. That market has been down total market down about 34% during the quarter. What drives that really is that people’s accumulations that they would buy an annuity with are obviously down and they are very reluctant to buy annuities and lock in those losses. Now we are down a little more than the market. The market is down 34%. We are down 50%. Part of that is deliberate on our part. We have done some de-risking of our investment portfolio down there and therefore as a result of that we are not in a position to put out some rates that would enable greater sales.  So it is a combination I think of all those things. One last factor, relatively small but still had an impact, remember that Mexico is our big driver in terms of the top line and because of the H1N1 virus down there we pretty much lost I would say about a month out of the quarter. All of those things contributed to the results.

Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to MetLife's first quarter earnings release. (Operator Instructions) Before we get started I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife: Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time-to-time in MetLife, Inc.'s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  MetLife, Inc. specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Conor Murphy, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Conor Murphy:  Thank you, [Julie]. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's first quarter 2009 earnings call. We are delighted to be here this morning to talk to you about our results.  We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principals, so-called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplement, both of which are available at MetLife.com. Our reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment-related gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period, and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer, and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments we will take your questions and here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management, including Bill Mullaney, President of our Institutional Businesses, Lisa Weber, President of Individual, Bill Toppeta, President of International, and Bill Moore, President of Auto & Home.  With that I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Henrikson:  Thank you, Conor, and good morning, everyone.  During the first quarter MetLife generated $7.9 billion in premiums, fees and other revenues, a solid result in what continued to be a challenging environment. Obviously, the pressure from unfavorable equity and credit markets had an impact on earnings; however, our mix of business is well balanced and our business model and fundamental remain solid.  In a few moments I'll talk about the actions we continue to take to ensure our financial foundation remains strong, but first I want to provide some insight into the performance of our businesses.  The Institutional business generated a solid top line result as premiums, fees and other revenues were $3.9 billion for the quarter. This strong result was driven by a 5% increase in both group life and in non-medical health premium, driven mainly by organic growth. Our Institutional business has been built on years of strong, trusted relationships with our clients. In tough times like these, relationships become even more important. We are spending more time with our customers and the advice we provide is even more valued. Individual business earnings continued to be impacted by declining equity markets; however, fundamentals remain strong and we continue to benefit from a flight to quality. Variable annuity deposits increased over both the first quarter of 2008 and sequentially to reach $3.7 billion. In addition, we continued to see significant demand for MetLife's fixed annuity products, with deposits of $3.6 billion. Annuity net flows remain positive by almost $1.9 billion in variable annuities and $2.7 billion in fixed annuities. Both are benefiting from strong sales and declining lapse rates. In International premiums, fees and other revenues declined over the year ago period, entirely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 3% over the prior year period, due mostly to solid performance in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions despite volatile markets in a number of countries. As I said, the underlying fundamentals of our business are solid and we remain focused on strong underwriting and expense management. I am pleased with the continued progress in our cost reduction and efficiency initiatives through operational excellence and remain confident that we will reach our goal of at least $400 million of annualized cost savings by 2010. Now I want to talk a little bit about the Treasury capital programs and our own capital strength. As you know, MetLife has been a federally chartered bank holding company since 2001 and with more than $1 billion in total assets, we are one of the top 19 U.S. banking organizations participating in the Treasury's capital planning exercise being conducted under the Capital Assistance Program. We are working closely with the Federal Reserve on this exercise and will share more information with you as soon as possible. As a bank holding company, we were also eligible to participate in the Capital Purchase Program; however, as we announced last month, we have elected not to participate in this program. Let me tell you why.  At MetLife we are confident that we have the financial strength to continue to succeed now and over the long term. We are well positioned, with significant excess capital, a strong balance sheet, and leading market positions in our core businesses, where our revenues continue to be healthy. We have continued to take actions to reinforce our financial strength. Aside from our capital raise in the fourth quarter, we have already in 2009 successfully remarketed over $1 billion in debt, which was several times oversubscribed and completed an additional $400 million debt offering. In a moment Steve Kandarian will provide more details on our investments, but I just want to say our portfolio remains well structured and defensively positioned. While the credit markets continue to be challenging relative to the size of our portfolio, our loss experience remains modest.  In summary, despite the tough environment, our businesses are performing well. MetLife remains well positioned to continue to meet the needs of our clients and has the capacity and the financial strength to further solidify its leading position in the industry. And with that let me turn it over to Steve.
Steve Kandarian: Thanks, Rob. I would like to spend a few minute reviewing variable investment income for the quarter, realized and unrealized losses, our real estate-related holdings, and hybrid securities. First, let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pre-tax variable income was lower than planned for the first quarter by $508 million or $321 million after DAC, tax and other offsets, principally driven by negative corporate joint venture and real estate fund returns.  The losses related to our corporate joint ventures were principally driven by 2008 year end equity valuations which flow through our Q-1 income statement. Real estate fund returns were negative due to the continued decline in property valuations. We estimate that property values have already declined 20% to 25%, with an expected peak-to-trough decline of 35% to 40% in total. While we expect some moderation in these returns, we anticipate that results from these sectors will remain weak, at through the end of 2009, and that we are unlikely to achieve our variable income plan for the remaining quarters. On the other hand, income from our securities lending program continued to outperform plan. As of March 31st our securities lending book was approximately $20 billion, down from $23.3 billion as of December 31st. In addition, hedge fund returns improved from the fourth quarter and were slightly above plan. Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses were $535 million, in line with the previous four quarters. Of this amount, $145 million were credit-related sales. Writedowns this quarter were $1.041 billion, including $754 million of credit-related impairments. These impairments were experienced across a variety of sectors, including $358 million in corporate credit, $136 million of equity, $126 million in structured finance securities, and $134 million primarily due to our strengthening of general mortgage reserves. Non-credit-related writedowns of $287 million included $191 million of impairments on hybrid securities. These hybrid securities were impaired because they've been trading below 80% of amortized cost for more than 12 months and were downgraded to below investment grade in the first quarter. The remaining $96 million of non-credit impairments related to other equity securities which were impaired because of the length of time and the extent to which their market value has been below amortized cost. When added together, total credit-related losses from sales and writedowns were approximately $899 million before income tax or $584 million after tax. Gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities were $28.8 billion at March 31st, essentially unchanged from December 31st. While spreads declined in the vast majority of sectors during the quarter, this was offset by an increase in interest rates.  For example, BBB in high-yield corporate bond spreads declined 38 basis points and 182 basis points, respectively. However, five-year and 10-year Treasury rates increased 11 basis points and 45 basis points, respectively. As spreads have continued to tighten, our gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities have declined by approximately $2 billion since quarter end. Next I'd like to discuss our real estate-related holdings. As of March 31st we held Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $5.1 billion and a fair value of $3 billion, including 2006 and 2007 vintage securities with a fair value of $1.5 billion. As mentioned on the last earnings call, we expected that Moody's would downgrade virtually all 2006 and 2007 vintage Alt-A securities to below investment grade. Approximately 87% of our 2006 and 2007 vintage Alt-A securities and 60% of our total Alt-A portfolio were rated below investment grade at quarter end. As noted on several occasions, we believe our portfolio has superior structure to the overall Alt-A market. For example, 87% of our Alt-A portfolio is fixed rate versus 36% for the market. Furthermore, we hold no option ARM mortgages as compared to 28% for the market. In addition, 83% of our Alt-A holdings have super senior credit enhancement, which typically provides double the credit enhancement of a standard AAA-rated bond.  As of March 31st we held commercial mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $16.3 billion and a fair value of $13 billion. Based on fair value, 93% of these holdings are rated AAA and 86% are from 2005 and earlier vintages. Of the 2006 and 2007 vintage holdings with a fair value of $1.9 billion, 87% are senior or super senior securities with 20% to 30% credit enhancement versus 10% to 15% for standard AAA securities.  At quarter end MetLife commercial mortgage portfolio was $35.9 billion. As of March 31st, the portfolio loan-to-value was 59% based on a rolling four-quarter property valuation process or, we estimate, in the low to mid 60% range if all properties were revalued today. In addition, we also stress test the portfolio with peak-to-trough valuation declines of 40%, which shows our average loan-to-value increasing to the low to mid 70% range. In addition, our debt service coverage remains strong at 1.9 times.  To date real estate delinquencies and losses have been minimal. We had one loan default during the first quarter. In April we foreclosed on the property, taking a writedown of less than 15% of the loan balance, well below historical loss levels. In addition, only $2.2 billion of the portfolio matures in 2009. We are very comfortable with this level of rollover and expect to refinance and hold the vast majority of these mortgages as we refinance them at market rates.  Finally, let me say a few words about our hybrid holdings in financial institutions. At March 31st our Tier 1 securities had an amortized cost of $3.6 billion and a fair value of $1.5 billion and our upper Tier 2 securities had an amortized cost of $1.7 billion and a fair value of $919 million.  It should be noted that MetLife's hybrid portfolio is largely concentrated in top tier banking institutions. Moreover, our entire hybrid portfolio remains current on all interest and principal payments. Since the end of the first quarter hybrid security prices have increased as the fear of financial institutions defaulting has declined and several top tier financial institutions have called their securities at par. Let me conclude by stating that we continue to be comfortable with our overall inventories portfolio. While we have seen some stabilization in the financial markets, we remain cautious and defensively positioned.  With that I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.
Bill Wheeler: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. MetLife reported $0.20 of operating earnings per share for the first quarter. Despite the challenging economic environment our businesses continue to have solid results. This morning I'll walk through our financial results and point out some highlights as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter. Turning to premiums, fees and other income, we had top line revenues - which we define as premiums, fees and other income - of $7.9 billion. This represents a decrease of 2.3% as compared to the first quarter of 2008. Adjusting for changes in exchange rates in International and lower pension close-out sales in retirement and savings, revenues would have been up by 4.1%. Given the current environment, I think this is an excellent result.  Institutional revenues were down slightly - 1.7% as compared to first quarter 2008. This was primarily due to lower pension close-out sales, which fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Group life premiums grew at 4.8% as compared to the first quarter of 2008 and non-medical health was up 4.6% versus the year ago period, driven by growth in the dental business.  International had reported revenues of $933 million in the first quarter compared to $1.2 billion in the year ago period. Changes in exchange rates had a significant impact on reported revenue. On a constant dollar basis revenue actually increased by 2.8% as compared to the first quarter of 2008, driven by Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results. Underwriting experience was generally favorable this quarter. In Institutional, group life mortality of 92.9% was well within our guidance range of 91% to 95%. In non-medical health and other, group disabilities' morbidity ratio of 86% for the quarter was better than our target range of 89% to 94%, driven by stable incidence rates and strong claim management results. Individual's mortality ratio of 82.6% is more favorable than our plan of 89% and that was driven by lower claim activity. If we adjust for the impact of reinsurance, our net mortality results were still favorable. Turing to Auto & Home, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 92.4%, which reflects an uptick from the 90.8% experienced in the first quarter of 2008, but still below our planned ratio. Included in this result is a prior accident year reserve release of $17 million after tax, and that's compared to a $23 million after-tax release in the same period in 2008. Catastrophe losses for the first quarter were $8 million after-tax higher than plan. The combined ratio, excluding the impact of catastrophes and prior year development was 91.7%, and that's a very favorable result and better than the 92.4% experienced in the prior year period.  Moving to investment spreads, with regard to variable investment income, as Steve has just explained, we again saw mixed performance in certain variable alternative asset classes this quarter. We experienced losses in corporate joint venture and real estate funds, driven by significant year end equity valuations, which flowed through our first quarter results. Securities lending margins were strong and hedge funds performed well, with both asset classes coming in slightly above plan. For the quarter, variable investment income after DAC, tax and other offsets was $321 million or $0.40 per share lower than the 2009 plan. As Steve also mentioned, although we expect this area to improve, we probably won't get back to our plan.  Also due to market conditions, we continue to maintain high levels of liquidity. Cash and short-term investments totaled $30 billion at March 31st. This higher level of liquidity is also adversely affecting investment spreads.  Moving to expenses, our overall expense level was higher this quarter, but that was driven by high DAC amortization and higher pension and post-retirement benefit costs. The equity market decline of over 11% and interest rate movements in the first quarter reduced earnings through higher DAC amortization in Individual business by approximately $204 million after-tax or $0.25 per share.  Pension and post-retirement benefit expenses were approximately $80 million pre-tax higher than in the first quarter of 2008. At Investor Day last December we told you that pension and post-retirement benefit costs would increase by approximately $180 million in 2009 due mainly to weaker investment results. As we finalized our pension and post-retirement benefit calculations at the end of 2008 we also lowered our discount rate assumption and made some other adjustments. Using these revised assumptions, we now expect our pension and post-retirement benefit costs to increase by approximately $300 million in 2009.  Also this quarter we incurred $34 million pre-tax in operational excellence charges, which consisted mainly of severance payments and consulting expenses. The progress we are making in operational excellence is offsetting these higher pension costs I just mentioned. Turning to our bottom line results, we earned $159 million in operating income or $0.20 per share. Given the results this quarter, we don't believe the earnings guidance we provided last December is still appropriate. We have decided not to provide updated guidance because of the volatile capital markets environment. That said, if you normalize our variable investment income and the equity market impact this quarter, I think you can get a good sense of our underlying earnings power.  With regard to net investment gains and losses, in the first quarter we had net realized investment losses of $760 million after tax and other adjustments and Steve has just explained that in great detail.  Our preliminary statutory operating earnings for the first quarter of 2009 are approximately $120 million and our preliminary statutory net income is $45 million.  In summary, the fundamentals of our business remain strong and we continue to deal successfully with the challenging market environment.  And with that, let me turn it over to the operator so we may take your questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach.
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach: A couple of quick ones, maybe a big picture one. I'm thinking about TARP and I'm thinking about the government's stress and MetLife's sort of open comment in a press release a week or two ago, whenever that was, a couple of weeks ago, that indicated that you had no intention of participating in TARP.  I know that this is a bit of a touchy situation, but what can we take away from that commentary and that decision as it relates to your expectations around the government's stress test? Should we feel more comfortable, should your investors feel more comfortable about the stress test in light of your advanced sort of commentary about not wanting to participate in TARP.
Rob Henrikson: I'm laughing at your question a little bit, John, because you know I can't answer it. But a little bit of color might be helpful here or kind of walking people back in terms of what we have said about TARP and whatnot. And I don't spend any time thinking about TARP, quite frankly. You know, at the beginning, when we first had, out there in the marketplace, this discussion of TARP, which was a new program, we were asked about it and we said then and we've said consistently ever since then answers that essentially said MetLife has no comment. There was reason for that if for no other reason that it was our understanding that any activity relative to or conversations by anyone about anything about TARP was nonpublic information.  And we stuck to that and for quite a long period of time every time TARP was mentioned - and, of course, as time went forward, the discussions on TARP started to morph a little bit as to what it was. It was announced originally, I think the nomenclature TARP was very clear - Troubled Asset Relief Program - then it moved to the sense that this really couldn't work as quickly as the government hoped and so it sort of changed into capital injection, capital injection into healthy financial institutions that were large players in the credit market to help unfreeze the credit market and so forth. And if I recall there was even discussion about encouraging consolidation. Time went forward, the definition and the requirements around TARP continued to change. And during all of that period we were asked periodically do you have anything to say other than no comment and our answer was no. And I think there were a lot of reasons for us wanting to do that. We just thought it was the appropriate thing to do. The problem recently however with the new sort of rising interest in TARP relative to the insurance industry, there was quite a bit of press and discussion about TARP and who was eligible and who wasn't, and at one point people were connecting the dots and the facts became inconsistent with the messaging in the press relative to MetLife. And at that very point I felt well, this is not good; we need to set the record straight because by not saying anything or saying no comment, in effect we might be sending a message that the implications were correct and they were not. So we simply wanted to set the record straight. So that's the whole story about TARP. And I mentioned in my comments about the stress test. There it's very specific that there is to be no discussion at all about the stress test by any of the participants. And I know there's been a lot of questions and people guessing as to who's on first and so forth. There we simply don't know, quite frankly, when the Fed will release, so that's my comment.
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach:  Two other quick ones and thank you, Rob, for that, that's helpful. Bill, you mentioned statutory net income was marginally positive for the quarter. Can we infer from that that risk-based capital, since there was only modest deterioration in the investment portfolio, that risk-based capital was generally flat from year end?
Bill Wheeler: Yes. If I had to guess I'd say it's a little lower. We did have positive statutory income. The balance sheet shrunk a little bit because we paid off some liabilities in our retirement and savings area, so that would have implied that RBC would have picked up a little bit. I think the ratings migration that Steve alluded to in a lot of asset-backed classes where stuff got re-rated from investment grade to junk, that's a strain. Underneath this there's a lot of other moving pieces.  I would just kind of tell you that RBC calculation is really complicated and so that's why, for instance, on Investor Day last year we didn't really want to guess a single-point number; I gave you a pretty wide range, because it is complicated. We only calculate it once a year. So I think that the number is relatively steady. My guess is it's a little lower, but I don't really want to be much more precise than that. And we don't do the math every quarter and the math is complicated.  So, for instance, the fluctuations in interest rates have probably had a greater impact on some of the reserve calculations we have to put up, but we don't do those calculations until we do them - I think some of the reserves came down from year end, is what I mean. But we don't do that math every quarter. The only other thing I'd add, by the way, since you brought it up so RBC may be down a little bit. Cash at the holding company is $1 billion higher than it was a year end and that's not coming from dividends from insurance subs, that's from some of the financings we talked about and we sold a little business and stuff like that. So if I think about our excess capital position I would say it's, you know, the $5 billion plus number that we sort of have out there, I think that's still an appropriate number.
John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach:  Last one for you. If you think about - and I'm sorry if I joined this late and missed, maybe Steve commented on this - but, Steve, if you think about the sort of very broad and in some cases material credit improvement during the month of April, can you give us a sense for what kind of improvement in your marked-to-market or your net unrealized losses you would sort of guesstimate if we marked the portfolio from 1Q to the end of April?
Steve Kandarian: Sure, John. I didn't give that comment, but it was about a $2 billion improvement since quarter end driven by tightening in spreads, although we have seen a little bit of an increase in interest rates, especially in the long end of the curve, which offsets the number but it nets down to about $2 billion.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Colin Devine - Citigroup.
Colin Devine - Citigroup:  First, with respect to the VA hedging, Bill, can you just run through one more time specifically what you do on the GMIB and particularly how you hedge for the dollar-for-dollar withdrawal feature on that is question one.  Question two, for Steve, if you could give us some idea of where you were putting new money during the last quarter in terms of investments and duration. And then for Rob, you know, given the continued ramp up in the pension costs, perhaps you can give us some thoughts on does it still make sense for Met to have a defined benefit pension or is this something that you should be looking at doing yourselves, closing it down?
Bill Wheeler: Okay, Colin, I'll start about the VA hedging and specifically talk about the dollar-for-dollar.
Colin Devine - Citigroup:  Yes, particularly focus on GMIB.
Bill Wheeler: Yes, GMIB. Well - and Stan's sitting here next to me, so he'll correct me when I say something wrong - remember, now, GMIB, the accounting there is SOP 03-1 and so the ability to hedge to the accounting and the economics, it's a little looser than if it was a withdrawal benefit product where you could use FAS 133 where we can do everything much more tightly.  So in general for GMIB we use obviously a portfolio of S&P put options in general. We also, to kind of, I would say, hedge the longer-term economic risk, we also buy some long-dated S&P put options to kind of also hedge more of the economic risk as opposed to just focusing on the accounting.  So that's in general how the hedging works there. It's hard for the hedges because of the accounting convention of SOP 03-1, it's hard for the hedges to be perfect, but our track record is that we actually do a pretty effective job of matching off and that we have very little breakage or noise around that hedging program.
Colin Devine - Citigroup:  Bill, can we just specify - I just want to make sure that I'm hearing this very clearly - are the economics here driving your hedge program or is it the accounting and what here is properly hedged, the economic exposure or the GAAP results?
Bill Wheeler: My smart aleck answer is yes. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup:  It sounds to me that you're hedging the accounting and I want to get at, with these movements in interest rates and the decline and I'm glad you've got Stan there, is how much has the economic exposure moved for Met, particularly given - and also to talk about the experience on the dollar-for-dollar withdrawal and how you're trying to hedge for that.
Stanley Talbi:  Okay, Colin, let me try to help answer that. In addition to what Bill said, clearly we're direct hedging the GAAP accounting because we don't want to create volatility in our income statement, but we supplement the direct hedging with capital markets reinsurance and that capital markets reinsurance is what protects us against catastrophic movements in the equity market and interest rates on the piece that we're not able to directly economically hedge.  In terms of dollar-for-dollar withdrawals, we do have models that predict policyholder behavior depending on how much the benefits are in the money and that kind of helps us estimate what the dollar-for-dollar withdrawal effects would be in different economic environments, and that's kind of built into our direct hedging program as well as our reinsurance program.
Colin Devine - Citigroup:  And can you give us some sense of how the economics are unfolding here versus the accounting?
Stanley Talbi: Both parts are doing well. As I said, we do have a reinsurance program which is more catastrophic in nature. And we've determined that we could absorb some losses in our income statement, but we're more worried about the tail risk and that's pretty much what we hedge. So in terms of the economics, we do have some noise there, but it's all very manageable and it's all measured and it's really the tail risks that we've hedged against.
Colin Devine - Citigroup:  The tail, not the drop in interest rates?
Stanley Talbi: It's a combination of a drop in interest rates.  You know, for the GMIB benefit to be in the money you have to have either a catastrophic reduction in the equity market.
Colin Devine - Citigroup:  Okay, we're there on that.
Stanley Talbi: Or a big reduction in the equity market and lower interest rates.
Colin Devine - Citigroup:  Okay, well that kind of sounds like the current scenario, but maybe we can keep moving on.
Bill Wheeler: I don't want to leave it there. Interest rates have to be even lower than they are now effectively and that's a little bit about what's going on there. You remember, too, you know, and we did this on Investor Day - Stan's trying to cut back in, but I'm not letting him; I'm just going to monologue this - remember on Investor Day we also talked about how the GMIB product, is designed and how we think that's a very favorable design in terms of the assumptions built in regarding mortality and stuff. You know, a lot of times that doesn't get appreciated about GMIB, and I think that's part of the reason - obviously, GMIB is our most popular rider by a long ways, so that I think gives us some additional comfort about sort of the real economic risk here. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup:  I always like hearing from the actuaries, though. 
Stanley Talbi:  Yes, and if I could just remind you, Colin, you know, at Investor Day Bill showed some slides showing how conservative the purchase rates are in the contract and, in fact, on May 1st we made some modifications to make them even more conservative. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup:  I would say some modifications is an understatement.
Steve Kandarian: Okay, Colin, I'll take up the next part of it. You asked for the new money for the first quarter. Most of it went into governments and agency backed RMBS, so those were low-yielding assets that were quite safe and we felt like that was the right thing to do in the first quarter, to remain very liquid in safe assets. There was some investing into high-quality corporate bond, investment grade bonds in defensive industries.
Colin Devine - Citigroup:  And what about mortgages?
Steve Kandarian: Mortgages went up a little bit and the things we looked at with mortgages, we'd take a look at what we believe were both current market valuations today, meaning down 25% from the peak or so, and we stress tested them down further to 40% from the peak, which actually means below where they started in terms of the run up this last several years. And we tried to do things in kind of the 50%-ish range in terms of loan-to-value and that basis, with very strong coverages and, when we looked at the tenant role, very strong tenant rosters, no big tenants dominating the properties so, again, with an eye really toward preservation of principal. For the second quarter - you didn't ask about this, but I think your question kind of begs it - in the second quarter we'll probably ease a little bit back into some more spread assets, but still very much with an eye toward principal preservation after taking into account, again, some severe stress tests on the assets before we purchase them. So we could end up going back into things like CMBS, but only those that are trading down extremely hard, you know, very high quality securities after being stressed, virtually no chance of losing principal. The only question there would be how much money you'd make on the upside.  We've modeled those things out. We're starting to see things we think that could make some sense in terms of principal preservation, remaining defensive, and getting a chance to get our yields up a little bit. 
Rob Henrikson: Okay, I'll take the third one, Colin. You gave me so much time to think about it. 
Colin Devine - Citigroup:  I bet every employee at Met's listening to this.
Rob Henrikson: I could have retired by now just thinking about it.  First, just a slight look back. Those who've been following the company - I know you would recall - that when we became a public company we did quite a review of all of our employee benefit plans. The defined benefit plan was essentially left open for people who were currently members but closed to new members. We changed the shape and form to a cash balance plan and so forth. So for the plan that is closed to new members, it eventually - in other words, it doesn't really increase in terms of expense going forward because it's closed.  And so having said that, however, what we do each and every year is continue to review the total value proposition relative to talented employees and so forth, compensation in general, the employee benefit plans here, relative to your question specifically, and we will continue to do so. The total value proposition is very important when we look not only at certain parts of our company but all across the board, including our sales forces. But relative to operational excellence, relative to everything else we're doing, the employee benefit plans are definitely in scope.  Keep in mind we're in this business not only as an employer but we give terrific advice to a massive book of business relative to employee benefit plans, mostly to public companies, and we certainly go about following our own advice.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse: I wanted to start out on the commercial mortgage loan side. Steve, can you talk about - I know you mentioned you increased balances of commercial mortgage loans a little bit this quarter. Is what you're putting to work there pretty much just rolling over existing loans or are you actually putting out new money on new loans?  And can you talk a little bit about of your rollover portfolio, the loans that are actually maturing this year, can you give us an idea of overall how you're looking at that? Are you going to just roll over the vast bulk of it? Is there a portion of it you're not? You know, talk a little bit about risk of foreclosure and how things are looking there. That's my first question.
Steve Kandarian: We've done both in terms of rollover and new loans. But again, the new loans we're looking at and considering for extending credit to are very low loan-to-value after being stressed and there's not a lot of activity because those who don't have to refinance are holding on right now.  So we've seen sort of a decline in activity in both directions, meaning in the heated period of 2005, 2007, we had a lot rolling off prematurely because they'd refinance at lower rates or more aggressive terms as to loan-to-value, so we're seeing very little of that right now, so the portfolio's pretty stable - as I mentioned, $2.2 billion anticipated in roll off coming up here. And we've looked at the loans that are rolling off and in virtually all cases we're very comfortable with those credits, with the loan-to-values, with the tenant rosters in those cases, with the sponsors, equity sponsors and the amount of equity below us.   So we would anticipate in most or all cases we would actually extend credit on terms that we find attractive at yields that we find attractive. 
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse:  Steve, can I interrupt you there? As you're rolling these loans, the $2.2 billion, are you getting meaningfully higher yields? How is that playing out, because I'm just curious if you're doing it at existing rates? Is it at a subsidy or what's going on?
Steve Kandarian: No, we're doing it at market rates, so they are very attractive yields, higher yields than we've had in the past several years.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse:  And would that be north of 8%, north of 9%?
Steve Kandarian: It's generally right now in the 7s.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse:  And you consider that market rate?
Steve Kandarian: Given to loan-to-value of the properties we're talking about, yes.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse:  One other follow up on that is I think the comment was $134 million of commercial mortgage reserves. Just curious, is that related to specific delinquencies or foreclosures and what does that imply for your mortgage experience adjustment factor on RBC? Are you at risk of tripping that?
Steve Kandarian: The number's actually $110 million. I gave you $134 million in total for real estate, $110 million of that was the strengthening of mortgage reserves. And, I'm sorry, the rest of your question?
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse:  Is that related to specific delinquencies or potential foreclosures and would that trip you up with the MEAF calculation for RBC? 
Steve Kandarian: It relates to looking at the overall portfolio, certain loans we felt should have additional reserves strengthening against them. In terms of tripping up, I don't think that, at this point - there's just one delinquency, so at this point we don't think that's going to be an issue.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse:  The last question I had was just on cash. I don't know - 
Steve Kandarian: Tom, let me just add one more comment before we move on to a different topic. When you see yields in terms of new loans being written, most of the properties we're talking about here are very high-quality properties, kind of A properties in the top markets. So if you hear someone else on an earnings call talk about they got an 8% yield, that could be in a B market, that could be a property that's not very attractive, that could be high loan-to-value. There's a whole bunch of factors that go into what the appropriate yield is on these different kinds of mortgages, so please remember that we're talking about very high quality properties with strong sponsors, low loan-to-value, and in the top markets. 
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse:  Understood. Last question for either Bill or Eric, if he's there, just on cash and what happened. It looks like cash and short-term went down by about $8 billion. Is that because you're redeploying or was that the $5 billion net redemption in global GICs?  And then can you also comment on what's going on with the FHLB because I think you borrowed something in the $15 billion ballpark. Should we expect that that's going to remain outstanding?
Bill Wheeler:  I'll take that. So with regard to cash, we had $38 billion of cash and short-term at year end and now the comparable number's down to $30 billion, so that's the $8 billion decline. Now of the $38 billion, $8 billion of that is actually cash that's sitting as collateral for derivatives with our counterparties. You know, a lot of our derivatives, as you can guess, are way in the money, so that collateral sits there. That $8 billion has declined for a variety of reasons down to $4 billion at March 31st. So, if you follow the math here, our cash balance has actually declined now our real cash balance, if you will - has declined from $30 billion to $26 billion.  So, where did it go? It's been put out in investments so I think you get the sense from Steve that we're tiptoeing our way back into the credit markets a little bit. I think most of that probably went into agency securities.  Now we did at the same time repay - and you see this in the roll forward chart in retirement savings - we have repaid some GICs and some funding agreement backed securities that matured in the second quarter and we repaid those liabilities from the securities that were assigned to them. We have to use - especially in global GICs - we have to have very tight asset-liability matching. It's a separate portfolio. And so when stuff matures there's assets that also mature at the same time to pay it back. So, I mean, cash is a little fungible in some way, but that's sort of how it played out. With regard to the FHLB, you know, the balances really didn't change very much this quarter. Some of it rolled. We also extended some of the FHLB balances out into 2010, so some's rolled, some we've extended. Our expectation is that we're going to keep drawing on those lines for probably the remainder of this year. Certainly in the current environment we want to be drawing on the lines and we want them to have that cash, so that's my expectation.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: First, going to the equity market exposure, I guess we're getting a sense of what that does to your earnings on the way down, but can you just talk about how, say, a recovery in the markets, if we're up more than your 1.5% to 2% appreciation assumption in a quarter, how that'll impact both the GAAP earnings and the STAT earnings? And then a separate question related to the VA market. I guess there were some comments earlier about some changes that you were making. You didn't get too specific on them and I was hoping that you could do that. Really, what are you doing at the VA in terms of pricing, how much is it going up and what sort of restrictions are you implementing and how do you think about what you're doing relative to what you're seeing in the market if you have any color on that?
Bill Wheeler: Maybe I'll talk a little bit about accounting and then I'll let Lisa talk about the VA product and the changes we've recently made. Obviously, March 31st the S&P ended the quarter right about 800 - and, I don't know, it's 870 something, right, as of yesterday - and it had begun the year, December 31, 2008 it was almost exactly 900, so we've gotten almost all the recovery back - not all, but close - and obviously the stock market recovered a lot higher than sort of our 1.25%, so how does that affect the numbers? Well, obviously that decline in separate account fees, which we would have seen if the stock market had stayed at pretty much 800, that decline is now going to be very muted, so you'll see higher fees throughout the remainder of the year because of that and that'll obviously sort of, you know, help our earnings recover a little bit more than our base assumption, so that's good. The second thing is you'll see some DAC adjustment going the other direction. Obviously, when you have a decline in the market you have higher DAC amortization. There'll be some slowdown of that when the market moves the other direction, but you don't get it all - unfortunately because of where we are relative to sort of what I would call the base case, we don't get it all back. So that $0.25 that I talked about which was really an adjustment for equity markets, you'll get a piece of that back if the equity markets stay where they are in the second quarter, but probably not even half I would guess. But you'll get some back.  I don't know. Was that clear? That's probably as clear as I want to make it at the moment.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein:  Okay, that's fine. Can we go to VAs, then?
Lisa Weber : Sure. In terms of the VA market, we continue to see that business as strong for us with the flight to quality and people looking for safe havens. As you know, we did take pricing action in February and, as commented earlier, further benefit changes in May which are really very significant. May 4th we are decreasing the step up, which is probably the most significant change from 6% to 5%. We're also decreasing the period certain on the GMIB annuitization from 10 years to 5 years, we're increasing the age setback from 7 to 10 years, and we're modifying the portfolio flexibility from 85/15 equity fixed to 70/30. The no-lapse guarantee is going from age 60 to 62 and it'll still be at 100 basis points. So those are the changes. They are significant. We still continue to see ourselves in the enviable position because we're comfortable both with our product offering as well as our pricing, our hedging, which was commented on earlier, and very significantly our strong and broad distribution, which continues to bode really well for us, particularly in this market. When many other firms are letting go of wholesalers, our wholesaling force has stayed strong, has stayed loyal, it's stayed dedicated as has our affiliated field force. And so as I mentioned, we are continuing to gain market share. So we're positive as we go forward here.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein:  Maybe just a follow up for Lisa or Stan, those are quite a few changes, so as -year-old think about rolling those changes through to the economics of the product, what does that do to the returns of the variable annuity in sort of a more normal equity market environment?
Lisa Weber:  Let me just comment first and then I'll pass it over to Stan. The price increases, the fee increases that we made in February were really in response to the volatility of the markets. These benefit changes are more in response to the interest rate changes and we are confident that with these changes we'll regain profitability. Stan, do you want to answer further?
Stanley Talbi: Yes. The reinsurance we had in place was kind of like the equivalent of long-dated options so we were protected at least on that part with the increasing volatility and changes in interest rates. So these changes are really to restore profitability going forward at the levels that we like, so it's really to get back up to our targeted returns given the changes in the market in both interest rates and volatility. 
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein:  And then one last quick one for Steve. The $2 billion number in terms of the decline in gross unrealized losses, is that sort of pre-tax and pre-DAC or is that net of that stuff?
Steve Kandarian:  That's a pre number.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan.
Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan: I had a few questions, first for Bill. I think this was asked, but I'm going to ask it in another way. On earnings, if you take out the DAC expense being high and normalize [inaudible] income, I think you're in the low 80s, maybe $0.83 for the quarter. You mentioned in the second quarter fee income should get better, maybe DAC will be a little bit lower, but on the hand your variable [inaudible] income should be weaker than what's implied in that 83, which is probably the $150 million [guidance]. So directionally, should we expect the earnings to rebound with the rebound in the market? My expectation is that they should actually be lower, but if you can comment on that one.  Secondly, for Steve, I think MetLife's talked in the past about realized investment losses being about 1% of the portfolio in 2009, which would imply $3 billion for the year. This quarter I think it was $584 million pre-tax roughly - or after tax - $900 million pre-tax, so you're running a little bit higher than that, what your expectation is for the rest of the year. And finally for Bill Mullaney on retirement and savings, your sales this quarter were very strong, mostly driven by structured settlements, but I'm assuming close-out activity was weak and if you could just talk about your expectations for closeout sales given that rates are pretty low and most plans are underfunded, so most likely I don't think there should be a pickup in sales as the year goes on. 
Bill Wheeler: Well, Jimmy, I'll go first. So we reported $0.20. We talked about the miss versus plan on variable investment income being worth $0.40 and then the equity impact in the equity linked products being $0.25. If you just take those moving pieces you get $0.85. Now, there's a whole bunch of other noise which nets, I think, to sort of a negative $0.02, if you will, so that's your $0.83. Now a couple of things to keep in mind about that. The $0.40 miss, that's versus plan. Now, you heard both Steve and I talk about we don’t think we're going to get the plan for the remainder of the year and I don't think we will. In the second quarter, where we have some visibility now, we don't think we'll get back to plan, okay? It's going to be a meaningful improvement over the first quarter and I think we'll get most of that $0.40 back, but I don't think we're going to get it all back. So that would imply that sort of the run rate isn't in the 80s, it's lower. I mean, maybe it's in the 70s. Now where the equity markets are at, I mean, obviously that'll help a little bit on the margin if the stock market stays high but who knows? We have a couple more months to go here yet in the quarter.  And the other thing that I think that's sort of out there that I just want to make sure to mention is the cash levels we're holding - and even when some of our money which isn't in cash, you know, it's in fairly low-yielding very safe highly liquid sort of Treasuries and agencies - this conservatism, which I think is appropriate, it's costing us money, though. And it's always a little hard to calculate exactly how much that's costing you a quarter, but it's at least $0.10 a quarter and could be more.  We're also not going to change that situation right now. I think we will change it eventually, but certainly not in the second or third quarter we're probably not going to change it very much. So hopefully that'll give you a little sense of sort of what I think the run rate might be and sort of one of the other issues around it in terms of current earnings power.
Steve Kandarian: Jimmy, as to realized losses going forward, it is difficult to know whether the 1% number will [inaudible] come out or not. I mean, it could be somewhat higher. It really depends on how things unfold here in the economy in the coming quarters.  Some of the likely places we'll see some stress would be the hybrid area. As we said, it's improved a little bit since quarter end, but let's see where that comes out. Loans related to more leveraged corporate credit could be an area you'll see some stress over the course of the year, and a few other buckets that might be under pressure.  So it's just very difficult to say precisely where these things will come out, but I think the 1% or somewhat higher area is what we're talking about.
Bill Mullaney:  Just to give you a little color on closeouts, you did hit on some of the key points that we're seeing in the marketplace. Obviously with equity markets down in 2008 the number of plans that are now in underfunded status is up and the low interest rate environment obviously does have an impact on prices. But having said that, there are some plans that remain fully funded and we've been in active discussions with a number of plan sponsors around some of these opportunities.  You know, the fundamentals of this business don't really change in terms of assessing the underlying liabilities and then doing the analysis around the pricing, so I would say we still remain very comfortable with this market. We're willing to do deals at the right prices and we have the capital to be able to do that, so we continue to be in the market. There are some active discussions and we're optimistic that we may see some deals take place in 2009.
Operator:  Your last question comes from Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton.
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton: I guess, Bill, first question, could you just help explain how STAT earnings were positive in the quarter? It surprised me a little bit. I mean, I guess what I'm really getting out without wanting a reconciliation but rather were there any single notable items that we should pay attention to?
Bill Wheeler: Yes, that's a good point because it isn't obvious why we would have GAAP net losses and STAT positive earnings. So remember now, when we take an impairment we impair both for GAAP and STAT and we've always done it that way and I think everybody else is supposed to now follow us and do it the same way we do - that's my impression. But what you don't see is remember in the last quarter we had some very big derivative gains because of some interest rate floors and swaps we had which went way in the money. We have used those as hedges against some of our minimum interest rate liabilities. So while Treasury rates were so very low, overall interest rates, factoring in credit spreads, were still relatively high.  But we had this gain so what we decided to do in the first quarter is pocket some of that gain because in GAAP, of course, as the change in the value of the derivative flows to the income statement, but STAT, you know, it's when you actually sell it. So we sold some of those derivatives or cashed them in, if you will, in the first quarter and we pocketed the gain and that basically offset the billion dollar impairment that we took on a GAAP basis. So we did have some very small realized investment losses on a STAT basis, but net income was therefore still positive.
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton:  And I guess just following on that, what kind of risks are there in terms of interest rate changes that, by selling the derivative we take going forward in earnings?
Bill Wheeler: Well, it's funny. The answer's, I think, almost none unless you get back to sort of a Japan interest rate scenario. I mean, that's what those interest rates derivatives were used to protect against. For instance, we have a lot of 10-year floors and stuff. So you probably won't see hardly any impact in earnings unless we have a severe interest rate scenario. Interest rates have obviously moved up since year end, so it's coming our way. We will also probably, at the right time, we'll re-strike. We want to put on some new hedges. But we just felt here's all this value sitting in front of us and we think probably Treasuries are going to rise or going to decline in value or interest rates are going to go up. It'd be a real shame to let that just dissipate. Why don't we just take them off the table? And that's what we did. 
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton:  And then, Steve, a lot of discussion about the commercial real estate block or the commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Can you just provide some color on the fundamentals in the agricultural booking, thinking about performance, risks you're focused on, what is on your watch list, maybe just some color in that area since it does get a little bit less attention.
Steve Kandarian: Okay. First let me note that in general our ag mortgage portfolio has a lower loan-to-value than even our commercial mortgage portfolio. They tend to be very conservative loans; historically very low delinquencies or defaults or losses. The area we'll see some stress will be the biofuels sector. And we don't have a great deal of exposure there but we have some, and that's the area that we're watching most closely and if there is some stress we're most likely to see the stress in. But overall the portfolio still is very sound and very strong.
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton:  And then I guess just finally, you talked about stressing the commercial mortgage loans and I think you said you looked at it on a 40% decline in kind of what the result in average LTVs were. Are there any metrics that you can give us in terms of kind of what percentage falls above a certain LTV range? Maybe it's 85% after you do that stress test. Are there any kind of metrics to kind of look at what would be perceived as the more risky areas?
Steve Kandarian: I'm not sure I have that number right with me, but the stress test, we took things down 40% from the peak just to kind of review that means. That's really taking a look at 2003s or the beginning of the uptick. And if you take 100, for example, and take it up 40 to 140 and you take it down 40%, that takes you down to 84, which means 16%, the low where you started from.  So under that extreme scenario, I gave you the numbers, about, you know, low to mid 70s overall, but obviously there'll be some above the 85% range. And we've done that stress testing and had the numbers, but I just didn't bring that with me. 
Conor Murphy: Okay, Julie, thank you.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. If you should require assistance during the call, (Operator instructions). And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time-to-time in MetLife Inc.'s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife Inc. specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Conor Murphy, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Conor Murphy: Thank you, Julie. Good morning everyone. Welcome to MetLife's fourth quarter 2008 earnings call. We are delighted to be here this morning to talk with you about our results. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, or so called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplements, both of which are available at metlife.com, on our Investor Relations page. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible, because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment related gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period, and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments, we will take your questions. And here with us today to participate in the discussion are Bill Mullaney, President of our Institutional businesses; Lisa Weber, President of Individual; Will Toppeta, President of International; and Bill Moore, President of Auto and Home. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rob Henrikson.
Rob Henrikson: Thank you, Conor, and good morning everyone. In both the fourth quarter and full-year 2008, MetLife generated strong topline results amid the current backdrop of broad weakness in the economy and market uncertainty. While operating earnings are being impacted, our core operating fundamentals remain strong, as premiums, fees and other revenues grew 6% this quarter over the fourth quarter of 2007 and are up 11% year-to-date. In this environment, we are benefiting from a well balanced mix of businesses, and without question we are experiencing a flight to quality and a flight to safety. Let me highlight a few examples. Institutional business continued to generate significant topline growth across all of its segments, as premiums, fees and other revenues for the year grew 19% to reach $16.6 billion. Driving this was a topline increase of 7% in Group Life and 14% in non-medical health, driven mainly by organic growth, especially in dental. In Retirement and Savings, we doubled our revenue, due to a strong demand in structured settlement sales as well as significant pension closeout sales in both the US and the UK. Individual business continues to be impacted by the declining equity markets. However, variable annuity and positives remain strong at $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. In addition, we saw significant demand for our fixed annuity products with deposits of $4.1 billion. Annuity net flows remained positive by almost $1 billion in variable annuities and $3 billion in fixed annuities. In International, we continued to see strong growth across all regions as premiums, fees and other revenues for the full year grew 11%. Latin America, our largest region grew 11%. Asia-Pacific grew 7% despite the challenging equity markets and our emerging European region, which includes India, grew 38%. Like our domestic businesses, our international operations continued to grow in a diversified and well balanced manner. In a few moments, you will hear from Bill Wheeler and Steve Kandarian, but let me just say I am very pleased with the strength and composition of our balance sheet. Our investment portfolio is well-balanced and defensively positioned and our excess capital provides us with tremendous financial flexibility and positions us well for the future. Looking ahead to 2009, we will remain focused on fundamentals, including underwriting and expense management, and let me just say through our Operational Excellence initiative, we have already achieved in excess of $150 million of annualized pretax savings and I remain confident that we will reach our stated goal of at least $400 million of total future cost savings. As we continue to do what we do best, I believe we will set ourselves apart in the marketplace as the strong, trusted, and valued company we are. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.
Steve Kandarian: Thanks, Rob. With the continued volatility in the financial markets, I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing variable investment income for the quarter, realized and unrealized losses in certain asset classes that have been receiving attention in the news. First, let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pretax variable income was approximately $540 million lower than planned for the fourth quarter, primarily driven by negative hedge fund and real estate fund returns. We expect the income from these sectors will remain weak at least through the first half of 2009. On the other hand, income from our securities lending program continued to outperform plan due to the steeper yield curve and higher spreads in the reinvestment portfolio. As of December 31, our securities lending book was approximately $23.3 billion, down from $26.8 billion on November 30 as discussed on Investor Day. As of December 31, the amount of assets unopened has been reduced to $5.1 billion from approximately $15.8 billion on November 30. Of the $5.1 billion of securities unopened, about $4.5 billion were treasuries and agency securities, which if put to us, can be immediately sold and satisfy the cash requirements. While the demand for securities lending from our counterparties has stabilized for now, we're maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet any further reductions. Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses were $664 million. Of this amount, $176 million were credit-related sales. Write-downs in this quarter were $546 million, including $444 million of credit related impairments. These impairments were experienced across a variety of sectors, primarily driven by corporate credit, increased mortgage reserves, and commercial mortgage backed securities. No single issuary accounted for more than 10% of total impairments. Non-credit related write-downs of $102 million consisted of certain equity-related holdings, which were impaired because of length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost. When added together, total credit-related losses from sales and write-downs were $620 million before tax or $403 million after-tax. Net unrealized losses for fixed maturities were $21.3 billion at December 31, down from $26.9 billion on November 30. This consisted of $28.9 billion of gross unrealized losses and $7.6 billion of gross unrealized gains. The decline in net unrealized losses since November 30 was driven by both tighter spreads and lower interest rates. For example, CNBS spreads declined more than 280 basis points from November 30 to year end. Interest rates also declined across the curve with ten year rates dipping 71 basis points below between November 30 and year-end. Next, I would like to discuss our real estate related holdings. As of December 31, we held Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of $3.4 billion and an amortized cost of $5.3 billion. Recently, rating agencies have downgraded a number of Alt-A securities. As of December 31, 59% of our Alt-A portfolio was rated AAA; 4% was AA; 3% A; 13% BBB; and 21% was below investment grade. We expect that Moody’s will be downgrading virtually all 2006 and 2007 vintage Alt-A securities to below investment grade. If this occurs, obviously the percentage of our portfolio that will be rated below investment grade will increase. Our analysis suggests that Moody’s is applying essentially the same standard to all bonds, regardless of underlying collateral. As I discussed at Investor Day, we believe our portfolio has superior structure to the overall Alt-A market. For example, 88% of our Alt-A portfolio is fixed-rate versus 35% for the market. Furthermore, we hold no option ARM mortgages as compared to 29% for the market. Fixed rate mortgages have performed far better than both option ARMs and hybrid ARMs and we expect this trend to continue. In addition, 83% of our Alt-A holdings have super senior credit enhancement, which typically provides double the credit enhancement of a standard AAA rated bond. At year-end, MetLife’s commercial mortgage portfolio was $36 billion. We have the concern for some time that the commercial real estate market was getting overheated. During 2008, we sold approximately $650 million of higher risk commercial mortgages from our portfolio, resulting in a pretax loss of $85 million. As of December 31, we had only $3 million of delinquencies, which represents less than one basis point on this portfolio. Approximately $2.6 billion of our commercial mortgage portfolio is scaled to mature in 2009. We are very comfortable with this level of rollover and expect to refinance and hold the vast majority of these mortgages at market rates. Finally, let me say a few words about our hybrid holdings, a sector which has been the news recently. Lately, non-US perpetual hybrid debentures, also known as Tier-1 and upper Tier-2 securities have come under pressure due to concerns regarding the potential nationalization of UK and Irish banks and the possible deferral of interest payments. At December 31, our Tier-1 securities had an amortized cost of $3.6 billion and a fair value of $2 billion; and our upper Tier-2 securities had an amortized cost of $2 billion and a fair value of $1.3 billion. It is important to note that MetLife's hybrid portfolio is highly focused on top tier banking institutions. Moreover, our entire hybrid portfolio remains current and all interest in principal payments. As I have stated before, while a portfolio of our size will not be immune to losses, we believe the portfolio is defensively positioned for the current environment. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.
Bill Wheeler: Thanks, Steve; and good morning everyone. MetLife reported $0.19 of operating earnings per share for the fourth quarter and $3.67 for all of 2008, which is consistent with our Investor Day estimates. As I think you can see, our businesses performed well in the quarter, but our investment margins narrowed considerably and our DAC amortization significantly accelerated due to the decline in the equity markets. This morning, I will walk through our financial results and plans and highlights as well as some unusual items which occurred in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we had topline revenues, which we define as premiums, fees and other income of $8.2 billion. This represents an increase of 6.3% over the fourth quarter of 2007. For the year, our topline revenues totaled $32.9 billion, a 10.7% increase over 2007. By the way, all results and comparisons exclude RGA, which was split off near the end of the third quarter. In Institutional, topline revenue growth of 18% over the year ago period was driven by strong increases across all its major product areas. High pension close up sales during the quarter increased Retirement and Savings revenue by 80% to $689 million. Non-medical health and Other had a 13% increase in premiums over the fourth quarter of 2007, driven by dental, which was bolstered by a recent dental HMO acquisition. Growth in Group Life resulted in an increase of revenues of 8.7% over the year ago period. International had reported revenues of $1 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $1.1 billion in the year ago period. Changes and exchange rates had a significant impact on reported revenue. On a constant dollar basis, revenue actually increased by 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results, which were in line with our expectations. In Institutional, the Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 93.3%, bringing the full-year ratio to 92.3%, consistent with our estimated range of 91% to 93%. Disabilities morbidity ratio for the quarter was 92.9%, bringing the full-year ratio to 89.7%, also consistent with our estimated range of 88% to 90%. The morbidity ratio is being driven by lower recoveries and a modest increase in incidence rates. Auto and Home turned in a very strong performance this quarter. The combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 84.9%. Included in this result is a prior accident year reserve release of $27 million after-tax, compared to a $25 million after-tax release in the prior period. Catastrophe losses came in slightly more favorable than planned and the combined ratio excluding the impact of catastrophes and prior year development was 88.6%, which is clearly an excellent result. Moving to investment spreads, with regard to variable investment income, as Steve explained, we again saw mixed performance of certain variable alternative asset classes this quarter. We experienced losses in hedge and real estate funds, but securities lending margins were strong. For the quarter, variable investment income was $370 million or $0.40 per share after DAC, tax, and other offsets lower than the 2008 plan. If you recall, on Investor Day, Steve explained that our 2009 plan for variable investment income is $150 million per quarter, which is obviously a lower baseline than the 2008 plan. Compared to the 2009 baseline, variable investment income this quarter was lower by approximately $175 million after DAC, tax, and other offsets or $.22 per share. Another important factor with regard to investment spreads are cash levels. During the fourth quarter, we held much higher levels of liquidity due to market conditions, which adversely affected investment spreads. Moving to expenses, our overall expense level was higher this quarter, but that was driven by high DAC amortization as well as some one time expenses. The equity market decline of over 20% in the fourth quarter reduced earnings in Individual business by approximately $335 million after-tax or $0.42 per share. Most of this reduction was due to higher DAC amortization, which shows up in operating expenses. Also this quarter, we incurred $24 million after-tax in operational excellence charges, which consisted mainly of severance payments. We also had some one-time real estate expenses and made a contribution to MetLife’s foundation in this quarter. All of these expenses appear in the Corporate and Other segment. Turning to our bottom line results, we earned $148 million in operating income or $0.19 per share. With regard to investment gains and losses, in the fourth quarter we had net realized investment gains of $768 million after tax, DAC, and other adjustments. Included in these results were credit losses and impairments of $403 million after-tax, which Steve has already explained in some detail. We also had significant derivative gains of $1.6 billion after-tax, which arose primarily from the decrease of interest rates in the fourth quarter, as well as other factors. Remember that we use derivates as economic hedges, so there is an offset to these derivatives gains, which is not necessarily showing up in the income statements. For the full year 2008, we had statutory net income of approximately $1.1 billion. Total adjusted statutory capital at year end is approximately $24.3 billion. We have not finished our RBC calculations for year-end 2008, but based on our work to date, the range of 365 to 400 from Investor Day is still valid. Therefore, we believe that our excess capital position is still between $3.6 billion to $5.7 billion. In summary, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and I believe we are successfully dealing with the challenging market environment. And with that, I would like to turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And our first question comes from Suneet Kamath with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath – Sanford Bernstein: Thank you and good morning. Two questions if I could, first for Rob just on the M&A environment, I know you talked at length about your interest in doing deals and it had to be right deals, but just generally we haven't really seen anything in US life insurance sort of across the sector despite the market conditions and the attractive pricing, just wondering what you're seeing in terms of opportunities? And perhaps any thoughts in terms of why we hadn't seen anything, or the price is too high or people waiting for the capital markets to open up, just any thoughts on that. And then second for Bill. There's been a lot of talk about impairments of security on a stat basis versus a GAAP basis. Can you just talk about your approach and any lags that may exist between the two? Thanks.
Rob Henrikson: Yes, let me – I will take the M&A question. And I’ve said this publicly as recently as last week in a broad meeting. We are in a very unusual position relative to our capital strength in our position and so forth, I would say as good a position as anyone to take advantages of M&A opportunities. Having said that I am very focused as we all are on running our own business and making sure that any steps we take do nothing to in any way weaken our position our cause us to change even slightly what our strategic moment would be. That coupled with the economic conditions led me to say something that was picked up by notice on Bloomberg, which was rather nice I thought, where I said I'm really not interested in stepping into a lily pond if I don't know how deep it is. So we see no reason to be in a hurry. There is no M&A fever here, let me put it that way, and we will continue to watch the market.
Bill Wheeler: Suneet, it’s Bill. The answer to your question about impairments, the difference between stat and GAAP is very simple. There are no differences, perhaps. As far as – no there have never been any differences between stat and GAAP for us. And so there is no lag where our true up, if you will, sometime in 2009 where we are going to true up our stat impairments, because they've always been the same.
Suneet Kamath – Sanford Bernstein: Thanks, and just one quick follow-up on that, just as it relates to the hybrids, the perpetual debentures, I guess there is another bank in Europe that is not redeeming a security, as you think about the statutory capital implication to that is there any change in how you treat that security from a stat perspective, meaning moving from debt to equity if an issuer decides not to redeem. Thanks.
Steve Kandarian: It’s Steve. I think you are probably referring to Deutsche Bank, which back in December had an implied call date on one of their hybrid securities, which they didn't call in, and that results in extension of that security and the potential for reclassification that are redeemed. So, yet those securities potentially being downgraded obviously, there'll be some RBC impact. We did a similar worst-case analysis what if the entire portfolio were downgraded to below investment grade, and we don't think that's the case, but just picked the worst case. We think it's roughly 5 RBC points. So again, we don't think we’ll get anywhere close to that.
Suneet Kamath – Sanford Bernstein: Thanks, Steve. It was actually a different bank, Banco Sabadell, I guess, a Spanish bank. But thanks for the clarity.
Steve Kandarian: You know, I guess we didn’t hold that one.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go to the line of Andrew Kligerman with UBS. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kligerman – UBS: Hi, good morning. Let me ask one question, and then a follow-up. With regard to the DAC, it looks like there were about $376 million in unlocking in the quarter, but you didn't put out a prospective DAC unlocking number. Could you give a little color around what might hit that, what might generate a prospective DAC unlocking, and what the potential magnitude is? And then I'll follow-up.
Rob Henrikson: Andrew, you kind of came in and out, I think I understood your question, which was that I'm not sure everybody on the phone heard it, which was that there was a lot of DAC amortization and some unlockings this quarter, is there some kind of big perspective DAC unlocking that might be coming? And I assuming you're relating to whether or not, that would be linked. Obviously, we do have DAC unlockings based on changes in the assumptions.
Andrew Kligerman – UBS: It's 76 in the quarter.
Rob Henrikson: But this is based on the market, right? I don’t know if we really do this is any differently than everybody else, but we do explain it differently, okay. So, we obviously adjust DAC for market conditions every quarter, okay. So, whatever the stock market performance core to that was we always adjust DAC accordingly. Some companies don't do that. They wait and do it sort of annually. We don't, we do it every quarter. That said, we have this mean reversion formula that allow us to sort of smooth results, if you will, for sort of up and downs that you might have in any given year. And our mean reversion formula is we are very clearly at one end of the spectrum. In terms of – because the stock market has declined so much. So it's not really – so the formula is no longer smoothing results. So changes in the stock market are just flowing right through. There is no smoothing over some period of time. So as of now that's how that's working. So we aren’t currently anticipating any additional backend or some one big time adjustment because of where the current market conditions are. You know, I can't say that we won't ever do that, I mean, I guess, if the S&P environment got bad enough we may have to consider that, but obviously that would be a significant down from here. So we are not anticipating any big back unlock, if we were we would tell you.
Andrew Kligerman – UBS: Got it. And then just shifting over to the credit, about 600 million in realized investment losses in the quarter, you mentioned, no credit had greater than a 10% hit, but maybe just – and I know you said it was broad too. But just maybe more color on this, maybe what were the two biggest credits that were hit even if they weren’t 10%? And how much of it related to RMBS versus CMBS? Maybe a little more granularity would be helpful in getting a feel for this.
Steve Kandarian: It's Steve. It really is very, very equal across a whole bunch of different asset sectors. And we don't give out names of issuers, unless they go bankrupt or something. But CMBS was in there. I would say most of that was really in the corporate bond side, but a variety of different industries, including Media-NonCable was one of the larger ones, there were some real estate list, but it really nothing jumps out if it did I would tell you. But maybe be the most would be financial institution related, but nothing really downturn. There's no big numbers.
Andrew Kligerman – UBS: And it was primarily corporate debt?
Steve Kandarian: Yes, it was primarily corporate debt. Some CMBS, some Alt-A, but little bit of subprime, but we don't hold very much. So, it really was scattered this quarter. In the previous quarter it wasn't that way, but this quarter it was scattered.
Andrew Kligerman – UBS: And then just operationally, the big pickup and pension close out activity in the UK, what's the big driver there? And, with regards to the fixed annuity, that's the last question, what type of returns were you generating on that last uptick in fixed annuity sales?
Bill Mullaney: Andrew, it’s Bill Mullaney. I’ll just comment on the pension close out activity. We saw strong close out activity in the UK in the fourth quarter, as you know, we been in the business in UK for about a year-and-a-half continuing to build our business there. The pipeline continued to be strong in the fourth quarter. There were a lot opportunities to write business, but we were pretty selective about what we wrote making sure that we got the appropriate return for the deals that we do. So, we been very happy with our foray into the UK market, and we think the pipeline is going to continue to be strong entering 2009.
Andrew Kligerman – UBS: Any particular reason why it's just picking up so suddenly or –
Bill Mullaney: Well, I think there may be a couple of reasons. The first is having been in the market now for over a year we are getting more well-known and our expertise is starting to show. I can't tell you for sure whether some of the competitors in the UK may be pulling back, not being as aggressive quoting on some deals. But we’ve been seeing a lot of deals. We been putting our prices out there to get the returns that we want and we were able to write some deals in the quarter.
Bill Wheeler: Andrew, it’s Bill. About the fixed annuities, (inaudible) in just a second. With regard to returns because spreads are widen so much, and obviously the fixed annuity business has picked up a lot just I think for the industry, not just for us. But because spreads are widen so much we now have an ability to earn a pretty respectable double-digit ROE in fixed annuities. And so the stuff we sold this quarter we really are ultimately even though we haven't got it all fully invested yet we do expect to get double-digit returns on it. And I don't know (inaudible).
Lisa Weber: Yes, so let me just add a little color to what Bill said. The industry has more than doubled and we are pleased to see that the flight to quantity has largely been to us. And so as spreads widen, we kept our consistent pricing discipline and picked up market share as some of the competitors faltered. The other piece that happened here this is that we got footing into the bank channel, which was something that we didn't have really up until towards the fourth quarter. And so that momentum has really picked up for the last seven rating cycles there were only two where we were at the top in terms of competitiveness, the rest we were competitive, but we were not at the top and yet the applications and the money continues to flow in. So we've seen great momentum far exceeding our obvious Investor Day forecasts and that momentum we expect will continue here as the flight to quality in consumers go with the flight to safety.
Andrew Kligerman – UBS: Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question is from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher – Credit Suisse: Hi, a few questions. First on liquidity. Bill can you just comment on how much you would define as excess liquidity, any plans to put that to work. And timing point question two, I noticed there didn't appear to be much of a shadow DAC write-up quarter to partially offset the impact of unrealized credit losses. And the last question, for Steve, any risk of impairments to private equity and real estate partnerships, because I believe there is a lag of returns there. Can we expect any major impairments, prospectively there?
Bill Wheeler: Okay, Tom, I will take your first two. With regard to liquidity, I'm sure you’ve noticed between cash and short-term investments we have $38 billion of short-term liquidity on our balance sheet right now, that's a lot. Now that number is sort of a little high. There is some unusual reasons why that's high. Some of that is with regard to collateral balances with regard to some of our derivatives contracts, just quickly before somebody asked a lot of questions about that. When we are counterparties on derivatives we true up the contracts every day. And their money therefore sits in a trust account. And so that shows up on our balance sheet as ours, but it's really collateral, so it is us on a derivative. So, you kind of have to take that $8 billion of the top. So we are really talking about $30 million of cash and liquidity. How much is excess? Well, it's funny. You can define that a lot of ways these days. You know in a normal world certainly a year ago we would have held maybe $10 billion of liquidity on a normal basis. So you could say well the excess therefore is 20. And that might be right, but we are not going to go back down to $10 billion any time soon, I don't think. You are going to hold higher levels of liquidity for a while here until things get calmer. We have been building a lot of liquidity, mainly because we wanted to make sure that securities lending balance is stabilized, which it appears they have. And we also, you know, we just wanted to make sure that things were okay generally. You can see across our balance sheet, all insurance liabilities, in terms of lapse rates and stuff, things are very stable. So we feel good about that. So we will take the liquidity, the cash balances down. I'm not sure exactly how much we will take them down in the first quarter. But we will be investing some of that money out. I would also just add, you know, obviously holding this much liquidity hurts earnings, operating earnings and it clearly had an effect in the fourth quarter. We should get some pickup from that in the first. So we are going to invest all $20 billion next quarter, that's for sure. We are going to stay really liquid here in this environment. So hopefully that gives you a little color. With regard to shadow DAC and you know that you might write up. You know, they do obviously have, when we adjust the LTI for unrealized losses there is a small shadow DAC offset, but it is just small. And I think we’ve been doing – there is no change there on policy. I mean, we’ve been doing it consistently. A lot of our businesses, you know, you have appreciate most of the DAC in MetLife is in the annuity business or in individual life and annuity business. Though we have obviously unrealized losses across – some bonds across a lot of different product areas where we frankly don't have a lot of DAC. So I don’t know if that's sort of wise, maybe our business mix says, that's why we don't have much of a DAC offset. But we do recognize shadow DAC, but it's just a modest number.
Steve Kandarian: Tom, I will take the question about the impairments on private equity and real estate partnerships. As you pointed out there is a lag there. The year-end statements aren't yet in from these LBO funds and real estate partnerships. But we will be getting them over the course of the quarter, and I think that it's probably fair to say that there will be some marks on those portfolios and some impairments taken by them, which under the equity method will flow through to us in the first half of 2009. And I would say that the biggest area where we will see the harshest marks will be the large LBO funds. And we’ve been picking up some market intelligence on that. And that's why we think we will see some of the most significant marks. And I don't have the number in terms of dollars, but I think it could be in percentage wise in terms of what kind of marks they might take I'm hearing things in the marketplace of 10%, maybe as much as 20%, it depends upon their deals. And that's driven a large LBO space because of lack of exit opportunities for them, certainly in the IPO market right now, and even in terms of selling businesses in this environment, the lack of credit being available. So, that's a sort of thing we are anticipating. We don't have the numbers yet. So I can't be specific. But generally speaking that's where the pressure is coming from.
Tom Gallagher – Credit Suisse: And Steve, just a follow up, rough carrying value of allocation to LBO funds from MetLife.
Steve Kandarian: Our overall portfolio is $3.1 billion I believe. And large I think is around 40% of that. Certainly I got the number here, let’s see. (inaudible) broken down in terms of large in terms of dollars. But let's say about 40% of $3.1 billion, will get to about $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion, somewhere near.
Tom Gallagher – Credit Suisse: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We will go to the line of Edward Spehar with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Edward Spehar – Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good morning. Steve, I was wondering if you could talk about the non-agency trough in RMBS, the size of the portfolio and some of the concern in the market about this cram down legislation that could cause first losses to be spread across all tranches. And I guess the issues – what you think the impact would be on your portfolio from both the potential law standpoint and ratings downgrade standpoint? And then I have one quick follow-up.
Steve Kandarian: Okay. The size of the non-agency prime is $10.5 billion market value at year end. And in terms of the legislation, without going to all the details. The effect would be that the stock would not be traded at the same way as we are anticipating from the point of view of where those losses would be first absorbed. So normally if we are holding AAA rated securities the securities below us would absorb the losses first, this would make some of those loss, if not all of it pro rata across the entire various tranches. So, that would impact us in a way that we and others did not expect since this legislation is obviously is still pending and wasn't contemplated when we bought the securities. In terms of the economic impact we've done some analysis, we think it's small, in fact quite small, maybe less than $30 million to us in terms of ultimate sort of lack of cash flows coming into our securities. So, from pure economic point of view it does not have a large impact. The larger potential impact would be the ratings downgrade. Even that is relatively small in terms of RBC points if you want to translate to that, we are thinking it's just a couple of RBC points on a worst-case basis.
Edward Spehar – Merrill Lynch: And what does that assume in terms of downgrade, like how far – do you assume that the rate rating agency see that there's going to be $1 of principal loss? Where do they take securities under that scenario?
Steve Kandarian: You know, I looked at that analysis a little while ago. I don't know the exact detail how much it’s gets downgraded to lower investment grade and below investment grade (inaudible). But we did to have a worst-case analysis, and that's how our numbers came out. We are assuming sort of legislation goes through. I'm not predicting that but we would start running the numbers to see, what’s it means to us. So the economic losses and even the RBC impact is not terribly significant. By the way it's not on the entire portfolio some of these securities would not be impacted by the legislation. The only thing I would mention to is my understanding is that (inaudible) bill came through the house was passed and now it's in the Senate and probably go to conference before it probably gets passed and signed by the president. And I'm told that there is a fair amount of conversation now within the Senate about the consequences of this legislation. So the intent of the legislation obviously wasn’t to single out owners of the securities and penalize them or is to give relief to homeowners to prevent them having their mortgages floor closed up on and losing their homes. I think that people in Washington now are becoming aware of these ancillary and (inaudible) consequences, and we are hoping that the legislation will take into account those kinds of issues and perhaps come out in a better state than it went into the Senate.
Edward Spehar – Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. And just one quick one for Bill. Just could you tell us – I you might have missed this – statutory operating earnings in the fourth quarter and full year, and is there any reason to think that will change in ’09?
Bill Wheeler: Well, statutory net income – I’ll do the numbers now. Statutory net income for the full year was $1.1 billion, statutory operating earnings for the full year were $1.3 billion. For the fourth quarter, we had three big losses in both categories – in both areas, and obviously that's because of the decline in the market and stuff like that and how it affected certain of the liabilities and uncertain reserves we fed up. We would in a normal year, in 2007 for instance, we had about $3 billion of statutory net income, which was I would think a very normal year. And my expectation is that that we will end up in 2009 somewhere between those the numbers, the $1.1 billion in net income for ‘08 and $3 billion in ’07. And so it won't be quite as weak as it was in ’08 because of certain reserves we setup. But it will be – but it should be a little better than – or it won't be as bad as ’08, but it should be – it won't be back to normal. That's for sure.
Edward Spehar – Merrill Lynch: So, can we assume roughly that the sort of impact to the equity market decline on the variable annuity guarantee business. From a statutory standpoint, last year it was something in the neighborhood of 1.5 billion to 2 billion?
Bill Wheeler: No, it wasn't that big. It's a little unusual. We have obviously other equity exposure, not really, but we have in our institution of business we have some equity exposure, which isn't really a guarantee or anything like that. But we aren't forced because of sort of the auditing the statutory accounting to setup additional reserves, whether we think we are going to need them or not. So this really wasn't seen very much. There was some modest increases in reserves in something called separate account carbon that we had to put up for variable annuity, but most of that actually came from other parts of the company.
Edward Spehar – Merrill Lynch: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Mark Finkelstein with Fox-Pitt Kelton. Please go ahead.
Mark Finkelstein – Fox-Pitt Kelton: A few questions, I guess, just firstly thinking about earnings a little bit, Steve talked about kind of some pressures on variable income. I mean, obviously peers down. The core earnings $0.82, I guess really no commentary on the outlook $3.60 to $4.00, I guess, can you, Bill, just kind of talk us through the $0.82 core number, how to think about that in the context of the $3.60 to $4.00 guidance at the Investor Day, given kind of what we’ve seen since that point?
Bill Wheeler: Well, we obviously reported $0.19, now that the two big adjustments would be the equity market impact which we estimated at approximately $0.40. And then also the variable investment income which we estimated at sort of in that $0.82 number was worth $0.22. So, those two big things so to get to the 80s and then there is a bunch of other pluses and minus which are smaller, as they would sort of net to zero or near zero. So, I would just focus on those two big things. We had 20% drop or 20% plus drop in the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter that caused very high levels of DAC amortization obviously. And – but the quarter actually ended up with an S&P 500 at 900, which was where we estimated it would be when we held back 2009 ready for the static where we built that with 2009 plan. So, I guess I would say – so that’s sort of expands to me, obviously the S&P 500 is down so far in the first quarter, that obviously will put pressure on reported earnings. But we don’t do earnings projections for quarters. We all made assuming for 2009, the stock market goes up 5%, so we are – so we kind of feel like that sort of number that makes sense. With regard to variable investment income, and I try to give you a hint of this in my prepared remarks, we just try to – in coming up with the $0.82 run rate we didn’t really try to normalize back to the ’08, which is of course very stale now. We really normalized versus what we thought the ’09 base line would be. You’ve got a little color from Steve already about where certain alternative asset classes might come out. I am not try to kid you. I mean I think variable investment income will be very volatile this year. But again, we aren’t necessarily trying to project quarters, we project a year. And again, so $0.82 sort of relative to our full year projection, I think that’s sort ticks and ties and make sense. But it is going to be lot in the year, I don’t think that’s a big surprise to anybody. The only other thing I might add, that is an in that normalization and I addressed this a couple questions ago as liquidity. Liquidity is a pretty big drag. I think it has probably caused us at least $0.10 in the fourth quarter, probably more. We are not going to get it all back in the first, but over time I do expect that we are going to – our liquidity situation – we won’t be quite so liquid and so we will earning a little bit more on that money and that should help the numbers as well. So, hopefully that gives you a little color about projections – run rate versus earnings plan and that sort of thing.
Mark Finkelstein – Fox-Pitt Kelton: Okay. And then Steve, in your comments on the nature of the credit losses, I missed the number, but you mentioned kind of some mortgage related impairments. Can you just walk though those and what specifically they were?
Steve Kandarian: Those were an increase in our reserves, but the commercial mortgages be originated and hold on our balance sheet.
Mark Finkelstein – Fox-Pitt Kelton: Okay. And what was that number again, please.
Steve Kandarian: We don’t give up the number, I am sorry. It’s probably whole number.
Mark Finkelstein – Fox-Pitt Kelton: Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar – JPMorgan: Hi, thanks. I have a couple of questions. The first one is if you can talk, it’s for Steve, just on the aging schedule, the loss on securities that are down 20% or more for six months increased by about I think 1.7 billion. In the past you’ve been pretty proactive about writing stuff down that’s crossed a certain threshold for a certain amount of period. Should we expect more write downs of these securities as they enter that bucket or is it going to be different this time around for whatever reason? And then secondly just I had a question on your strategy for the variable annuity business. You’ve mentioned in the past you are raising prices. But have you revalued at your strategy and comment to that business given the balance sheet uncertainty and sort of the perception of risk if this exposure presents overall for the company.
Steve Kandarian: Okay. I’ll reverse myself to last question, I’ll give out that number. It’s $83 million of increase to mortgage reserve bond. Turning now to the six-month and 20% or more bucket, the standard applies, which is we take a look at those securities very closely if we cross that threshold of six months and a decline in value of 20% or more. But we look in determining whether or not we are still receiving all of our contractual cash flow, that status of the company, that is the issuer, meaning their ability to meet these cash flows going forward in the future. And essentially we don’t write down securities. We turn around, write them back up again if they are good securities. So, there is a double-edge sour, we are mindful that we have a real issue in terms of the ability of the borrower to payers, then obviously we are going to impair those securities and take it through the income statement in the quarter. So, the –
Jimmy Bhullar – JPMorgan: You would sort of be doing that regardless of what category this halts in, right? So, what’s the distinction as the amount that’s been depressed for a longer period increases, or is there one?
Steve Kandarian: There is a distinction between debt securities and equity – more stringent, our products in equity securities are largely driven by the SEC rules. So, you will often times equity securities kick over to the impairment bucket pretty quickly. But debt securities can stay in that unrealized loss position if it’s still, for example, an investment grade related company, maybe it’s interest rate partially driven, and that sort of factors. So, the extreme example is that if you have treasures and interest rates swung wildly and the treasuries were worth less because they bought them a few months ago at the all-time lows and the interest rates rose and we wouldn't impair those securities. So that is just an extreme example but that gives you some flavor as to why you wouldn't just go and automatically impair securities you believe are money-good securities, because in a bucket, that says they are down for 20% or more for six months.
Operator: Thank you. We will go to the line of –
Rob Henrikson: Excuse me, Jimmy, you asked a question I think about the variable annuity business. Let me start on that and then I will pass it over to Lisa who has other comments. You know, I have been, for a long time very vocal on the fact that we love the variable annuity business. One of the reasons we love it so much is because of the solid mix of businesses we have across MetLife. It is a way to do two things by the way, tell you that we are committed and secondly, to point out and get into other areas that people don't naturally ask a lot of questions about like Institutional business. Right now, I would argue that the need for the product, both in terms of downside protection for the consumer and the increasing focus on need for a retirement income. The need is as great or greater and probably the current economic situation drives is probably the most significant catalyst toward understanding what the need for this product and service is. We are very focused on the design, the pricing, and the distribution of these products. We have been very comfortable with our continuing organic growth; we continue to be comfortable with that. I said sort of as an aside, that if someone said would you want to with the swipe of a pen, double the business on one day, I have always said that might be another issue relative to the mix of our business. So, we are comfortable with the variable annuity business. We particularly – you know, we are known as the GMIB shop. We have gone over at both meetings and Investor Day about what the both the strength of the guarantee to the individual is but the prudence of the guarantee from MetLife's position is and we continue to be pleased with the business. And I would say, by the way we have of course exported our expertise to other countries and we hedge and manage that business in the same way as we do domestically. Lisa, you might have additional comments.
Lisa Weber: Yes, let me just add a little bit to what Rob said although I think you covered most of it, which is that in addition to making the changes that we have announced in terms of our (inaudible), we will be making other structural changes as well. The good news is that what we are seeing is that clients are really valuing our guarantees and we have the pricing power. They are willing to pay for them and we are going to be making those changes. The good news also is that as the market moves up, which it will at some point in time, we will get a tremendous profit kick here as well. We are pricing at good solid ROEs. We are seeing competitors drop out, we are seeing ourselves benefit in the flight to quality. If you look just in the month of December alone, the industry was down somewhere around 25% or 26% and we were actually slightly up. So we will continue to pick up share as we did in the fourth quarter, where while the final numbers aren't out yet but it does look like we will end in the number one position here. We have the diversity of distribution plays in in a big way here are both in terms of product and distribution itself. So when the market was moving a little bit away from fixed annuities because the CS from variable annuities because of CR, we saw we moved it into six. So it is about having diversity of product and also our distribution as this location in the market in third-party distributors, we have a very solid career channel and they're performing excellently at this point in time.
Jimmy Bhullar – JP Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We go to the line of Randy Binner with FBR capital markets. Please go ahead.
Randy Binner – FBR Capital Markets: Hi, thanks, most of my questions have been answered. I just had a quick question for Rob regarding TARP and CPP funding. Do you have any updated thoughts on that as it relates to Met and maybe the industry in light of more restrictive terms that are in being laid out by the government?
Rob Henrikson: Randy, I have absolutely nothing to say relative to updating on TARP. You know what my general position has been all along on in terms of commenting on it. It is a very interesting topic from an intellectual and political point of view, but beyond that, I don’t have anything to add.
Randy Binner – FBR Capital Markets: All right, fair enough. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Colin Devine with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Colin Devine – Citigroup: Thank you. Just a couple of quick ones. On the RBC numbers you gave Bill, what impact did the Reg. 128 change have on that; is question one. And question two with liquidity, how much the short-term investments and the cash ramped up in the fourth quarter. I guess it is at about $37 billion, $38 billion. When you're talking about liquidity, is that the kind of position you are continue to run here for the foreseeable future, that is number two. You broke out for the first time these mortgaging and consumer loans held for sale and I was wondering if we could just get a little bit of clarification as to what those are. Obviously they are at $2 billion at the end of the year from null the year before. And then finally, you mentioned you set up a bunch of reserve DAC bases. Was there any spillover to what you are doing on a GAAP basis and perhaps you could just elaborate a little bit on what the liabilities were in question.
Bill Wheeler: I think I will get the first three and I am going to pass the last one to Talby [ph], I will be tired by then. With regard to RBC, Reg. 128, you know, if you remember on Investor Day we talked about – that the New York State allowed us to kind of change the formula a little bit for calculating your Reg. 128 reserves.
Colin Devine – Citigroup: $2.3 billion or $2.1 billion.
Bill Wheeler: I think it was actually $1.8 billion and then obviously that got reported in the press a lot as we got this released. It actually – the fact that we got this released, we liked getting it but obviously because the market didn't get any worse we had recovered from a hedging point of view anyway, so we probably had very immodest impact, the fact that we got the relief had a very modest impact on our RBC, because we had a hedging cover. But the amount of stat reserves we had to put up for that was lower, but we still had the hedging cover the deal with it.
Colin Devine – Citigroup: Did you extend your stat capital by the $1.8 billion if you chop the reserves?
Bill Wheeler: Right. Because we hedged those reserves, you know, we moved them to our reinsurance captives, they were hedged. You don’t think they would just always keep it, so the flip side of that is well, but since you have the hedging asset, you must have got – therefore because the reserve was low, you must have got credit for that. We don’t calculate the fact that our hedging assets or hedging values are higher than our reserves than our reinsurance, that doesn’t help our RBC ratio. That is not really true for others but that is the way our reinsurance portfolio is set up and it doesn't help.
Colin Devine – Citigroup: You are not using your hedged to write up your RBC?
Bill Wheeler: Bingo. Thank you. You said that much better than me. So, now I forgot the liquidity. Yes, it is $38 billion, it is very high; no, we don't expect to run it that high we do expect it to come down, even in the first quarter. But going back to the idea of – you know, on a really normal – in a normal environment, we would only tend sort of $10 billion in short-term liquidity. We are going to be running quite a bit higher than that. So we are going to keep excess liquidity in our balance sheet for a while. With regard to mortgages for heath for sale, you are right, that looks funny, but there is a good explanation. You know, we own a little bank, MetLife Bank; we bought a mortgage origination business from First Horizon bank. That business, that transaction closed on September 1 during the third quarter of this year and this markets origination company, we didn't get this sorts clear, we didn't buy any legacy business whatsoever, we bought assets we bought a factory and a sales force that originate mortgages.
Colin Devine – Citigroup: Consumer or residential just to begin with.
Bill Wheeler: All residential, all prime, all high quality and we hold those for sale. We inventory them for a month and then at month-end, we sell them to Panny or Freddy. So that is the kind of one-month production if you will that you're seeing on the December 31 balance sheet.
Colin Devine – Citigroup: Thank you.
Bill Wheeler: Now with regard to DAC.
Colin Devine – Citigroup: Reserves, yes.
Stan Talby: Hi, Colin, it is Stan. I will just say one more comment on Reg. 128. You know the changes that were made actually resulted in a reserve that was slightly more conservative than the VA requirements will be at the end of 2009. So even though it helped RBC, going into 2009, 2010 it is actually still slightly more conservative than the VA requirements, which New York will adopt at the end of 2009.
Colin Devine – Citigroup: But didn't Bill just say it didn't help RBC?
Stan Talby: Well, it did help a little bit.
Colin Devine – Citigroup: okay.
Stan Talby: In terms of the additional results on us on a stat basis, that was actually related to Reg. 128 too. One of the changes that New York approved was the ability to move from 104.5% of Treasury rates in valuing liabilities to the greater of 104.5% of treasuries and a LIBOR swap curve. At the time they approved that, the LIBOR swap curve was quite a bit higher so we expect it to get some relief there. In the end, what happened with the LIBOR swap curve actually dropped, so we wound up holding the reserves at the treasury curve, which in terms of valuing liabilities was in the 2% range in terms of discount rates. So that kind of bumped the reserves up quite a bit from some of our separate account business.
Colin Devine – Citigroup: Given those changes and perhaps the earnings, do you still expect to take roughly the same level of stat or dividends out of the operating company this year or is that going to be down as well?
Stan Talby: You know, I am not sure what we will do yet. I think frankly at the end of the day, we will depend a lot on how big credit losses are. I mean, we have to manage to a 350 RBC ratio and obviously depending on what happens to the overall equity market this year and what happens to the debt markets, you know, we will probably be managing our stat dividends accordingly. So it is not clear to me how much we will pick out or not, to be quite blunt about it.
Colin Devine – Citigroup: All right.
Stan Talby: And I take a look at the separate players, you know, we generally only take dividends out once a year and we generally do it towards the end of the year.
Colin Devine – Citigroup: Okay, thank you very much.
Conor Murphy: And that concludes our call, thank you very much.

Conor Murphy - Investor Relations: Thank you, Julie. Good morning everyone. Welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2008 earnings call. We are delighted to be here this morning to talk about our results for the quarter. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, or so called non-GAAP measures. We've reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplements, both of which are available at metlife.com, on our Investor Relations page. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment related gains and losses which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian our Chief Investment Officer, and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments, we will take your questions. And here with us today to participate in the discussion are Bill Mullaney, President of our Institutional businesses; Lisa Weber, President of Individual; Will Toppeta, President of International and Bill Moore, President of Auto and Home. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert C. Henrikson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Conor and good morning everyone. I don't think anyone would disagree that the environment in which we are operating is unprecedented. I know it comes as no surprise that the earnings we reported yesterday, which are consistent with our pre-announcement earlier this month, reflect the challenges we are facing. This was an extraordinary quarter in our industry as we experienced significant deterioration in both the equity and credit markets. As I said in the press release, we are not immune to this and like all in our industry we are affected by these markets. But let me make one thing clear. MetLife is in a very strong position. Our fundamentals, the value proposition we bring to the marketplace and the unwavering commitments we make to our clients will not change. We are demonstrating how the approach we take to our business is working to our benefit. Just consider this for a moment, MetLife's premiums, fees and other revenues grew 16% this quarter, and we are up 12% year-to-date. That's 12% business growth in an environment where double-digit declines are not uncommon. And it is well above the 9% guidance we provided at investor day. Let me share a few examples. Institutional business continued to generate significant top line growth across all of its segments, as premium fees and other revenues grew 30% to reach $4.5 billion. Driving this was a 16% increase in non-medical health top line, as well as a $1.1 billion in retirement and savings revenue due to several large pension close-out cases in both the U.S. and the UK. While individual business was clearly impacted by the declining equity markets this quarter, variable annuity deposits increased over the second quarter. Also important, variable annuity lapse rates declined and net flows remain positive, both on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. In addition, fixed annuity deposits were up significantly, both year-over-year and sequentially. In International, we continued to see strong growth as premium fees and other revenues grew 12% over the prior year. This top line growth was essentially driven by all countries, particularly in Mexico and Chile. In Japan, we continued to strengthen our variable annuity distribution by doubling our Japan post locations from 160 to 320 outlets. In short, we are growing our business simply by doing the same that has put us in the strong position that we are in today; talking to our customers, managing our risk and keeping a close eye on expenses. It is important that all of our customers, shareholders, business partners and employees understand that we will continue to manage MetLife for the long term. This long-term approach has served us well particularly with regard to our investment portfolio. Steve Kandarian will provide you more detail in a moment, but I want to talk briefly about our realized losses. Like I said earlier, the third quarter of 2008 was an extraordinary credit quarter. But relative to the size of MetLife's portfolio, the company's level of realized investment losses has remained modest. To put this in perspective, with regard to our capital position, the $485 million in credit losses and impairments we recorded are not much more than the excess capital we generate in a quarter. In short, this truly dramatic core quarter barely impacted our capital position. Now I know that you're interested on our plans for the $2.3 billion in capital that we raised to two weeks ago. And we'll continue to talk to you about that. But let me say a few things. We enjoy a competitive advantage because we are big, we are strong and we are trusted. The stock offering was completed...as we completed has bolstered our excess capital and positions us well for the future. Before I turn the call over to Steve, I'd like to briefly mention our operational excellence initiative, as it's important from a long-term approach we take to our business. As critical as our day-to-day business management is, looking ahead to identify opportunities that will make this great company even greater is critical. We're identifying ways to operate with the utmost efficiency, bringing new products to market quicker and most importantly promote profitable growth. We've made some noteworthy progress on this initiative identifying future cost savings that we expect will reach at least $400 million a year. The changes we are making inevitability affect our employees. As such, U.S. based associates whose jobs are being eliminated have been notified and we are committed to helping all of our associates manage through this change. I know that the past few weeks have been very challenging. However, it is at times like this with MetLife sets itself apart due to its stability and strength. Maintaining our common stock dividend at $0.74 a share, represents our confidence in our long-term outlook and further demonstrates the value we bring to our shareholders. Over the past 140 years, our company has seen extraordinary market cycles, which is why as I often tell our customers and our shareholders that we'll always remain focused on the long term. And in the current economic climate, this approach serves us well. And with that, let me turn it over to Steve Kandarian.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: Thanks, Rob. Given the increased volatility in the financial markets, I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing variable investment income, realized and unrealized losses and certain components of our portfolio. First, let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pre-tax variable income was approximately $200 million lower than planned for the third quarter, primarily driven by negative corporate joint venture in hedge fund returns. As I have mentioned on the previous two earnings calls, we expected corporate joint venture income to be under pressure due to overall market conditions. Furthermore, we anticipate corporate joint venture and hedge fund returns to remain weak for the remainder of the year. On other hand, income from our securities lending program continued to outperform plan due to the steeper yield curve and higher spreads in the reinvestment portfolio. In our securities lending business, we lend various types of fixed income assets in return for cash collateral which we reinvest in a diversified portfolio of securities. As of September 30th, our securities lending book was approximately $41 billion, down from $45 billion at June 30th. As mentioned on the October 8th pre-release earnings call, the demand for securities lending by our counter parties has decreased. As a result, these balances have declined further to approximately $31 billion as of October 28th. Of this $31 billion, approximately $15 billion was unopened, which means the securities can be returned to us overnight. The remainder of the balance has varying maturities ranging from one week to several months. Of the $15 billion securities unopened, about $13 billion were treasuries and agency securities which, if put to us can be immediately sold to satisfy the cash requirements. Should liquidity need to accelerate, we have a pool of $14.6 billion in cash to meet those needs. And in addition, we had the high... we have the liquidity resources of most of MeLife's general account at our disposal. We plan to remain in this business in the future; we expect the balances will decline further in the coming months. Again, we have sufficient liquidity to facilitate this reduction. I will provide a plan for 2009 variable income at our investor day in December. Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses were $465 million, which is in line with the previous four quarters. Only $46 million were credit related sales. Write-downs this quarter were $1.48 billion. Of this amount, $700 million were credit related impairments. This is primarily driven by $548 million of impairments of our holdings in Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual and AIG. The non-credit related write-downs of $348 million consisted of impairments of equity securities and subsequent sales of securities in the fourth quarter they were planned in the third quarter. When added together, total credit related losses from sales and write-downs were $746 million before tax or $485 million after tax. Unrealized losses for fixed maturities were $16.7 billion at September 30th. 88% of these unrealized losses are investment grade securities. The increase in unrealized loss was driven by significant spread widening across virtually all asset sectors. For example, during the third quarter, A corporate credit spreads increased by over 200 basis points to 461 basis points and AAA rated credit card spreads increased to over 240 basis points to 420 basis points. Next, I'd like to discuss our real estate related holdings. As of September 30th, we held $1.4 billion of sub-prime residential mortgage-backed securities. 95% of these securities continue to be rated AAA or AA and 80% are from 2005 or earlier vintages, benefiting from stronger underwriting. As of September 30th, we held $4.4 billion of Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities. 83% of our Alt-A portfolio is super senior AAA, which provides almost double the credit enhancement of AAA securities. In addition, 87% of our Alt-A portfolio is fixed rate, we hold no option on mortgages. By contrast, overall the Alt-A market is 66% floating rate, including 26% in option ARMs. We continue to run stress test on our holdings in these sectors, and we remain comfortable with our assets. MetLife's commercial mortgage portfolio currently totals $36 billion. We have taken a defensive position in originating and managing our commercial mortgage portfolio. Since 2005, in response to aggressive underwriting and weak deal structures, we focused our mortgage originations on moderate and low leverage loans. As of September 30th, the average loan to value of our portfolio was 57% and less than $2 million of our portfolio was delinquent. Finally, let me say a few words about our credit portfolio. Last year, we began to reposition our portfolio for a potential recession. Since October 2007, we have sold approximately $7.2 billion of securities. We believe we're vulnerable in a recession, including $4.1 billion from investment grade corporate bonds and $2.6 billion of below investment grade securities. While a portfolio of our size will not be immune to losses, we believe the portfolio is defensive positioned for the current environment. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Steve and good morning everybody. This morning, I'd like to walk through MetLife's third quarter results. MetLife reported $0.88 of operating earnings per share, 40% decline from the third quarter of 2007, which is consistent with our pre-announcement earlier this month. As I mentioned then, our third quarter results are respectable given the difficult environment. By the way, all the numbers in comparisons I will speak about this morning, exclude RGA which was split of in a transaction, which closed on September 12. So let me begin with top line revenues, which will be defined as premiums, fees and other income. Top line revenues were $8.6 billion this quarter, an increase of 16% over the third quarter of 2007. Year-to-date revenues are up 12% over the first nine months of 2007. So our revenue growth is strong. In International, top line revenues increased 13% over the prior year quarter to $1.2 billion. Changes in FX rate increased revenue growth by approximately 1 point this quarter. International revenue growth was driven largely by a very strong performance in our Latin America region. In Institutional, top line revenue growth of 30% over the year ago period was driven by strong revenue growth across all of our major products lines. High pension close-out sales during the quarter increased retirement and savings revenue to $1.1 billion. Non-Medical Health & Other had a 16% increase in premiums over the third quarter of 2007. That was driven by dental, which was also bolstered by our recent HMO acquisition. Growth in group Life resulted in an increase of 7% over the year ago period, which is also quite good. Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results. In Institutional, our Group term life mortality ratio of 90.7% was excellent, and below our target range of 91 to 95%. In Non-Medical Health and Other, group disabilities morbidity ratio was relatively high at 95.6%, and was driven by lower recoveries and higher incidence. In our dental product, claims utilization was higher than the prior year quarter resulting in lower underwriting margins. In Individual business, our mortality ratio was 82.7%, effectively on plan. Let me point out that this exclude the impact of reinsurance. If we adjust for that, our net mortality results were unfavorable by about $60 million after tax, or about $0.02 per share. Auto and homes combined ratio including catastrophes was 89%. Catastrophe claims were $13 million after tax higher than plan, or $0.02 per share. But this was more than offset by a favorable non-cash prior accident year development of $27 million after tax or $0.04 per share. The combined ratio excluding the impact of catastrophes and prior year development improved 85.2% year-over-year, that's an excellent result. This was driven by strong core operating results in the auto area. Moving to investment spreads, with regard to variable investment income as Steve just described, we again saw a mixed performance of certain variable alternative asset classes this quarter. Private equity returns were well below planned and we experienced losses in our hedge funds, but securities lending income have performed above plan. Overall, variable investment income was approximately $120 million after tax, tax and other offsets were $0.17 per share lower than our baseline plan. As part of the equity raise this month, we indicated that securities lending line was declining and Steve gave you some additional numbers on that a moment ago. This will reduce securities lending income in the fourth quarter. Moving to expenses, our expense ratio in the third quarter was high at 30.7%. However, there were a number of specific items that drove up expenses this quarter. First, higher DAC amortization caused by the 9% decline in the S&P 500 in the quarter impacted us by approximately $129 million or $0.18 a share. I've explained this before, but I want to make sure that everyone understands that we true up our annuity DAC balances every quarter, based on the performances of the related separate accounts. We don't just do it once a year. Second, we accrued approximately $48 million or $0.07 per share related to the first phase of the company's operational excellence initiatives. The accrual are largely relates to severance of employees who'll be leaving around the year end and we expect this action will result in annual life savings of about $130 million. Also this quarter, MetLife announced the decision to commute its access insurance policies for its fastest related claims. That amount had a charge of a $23 million or $0.03 per share. Adjusting for these specific items, our expense ratio was actually below guidance and therefore we think our expenses are well under control. Turning to our bottom line results, we are in $639 million of operating income, or $0.88 per share. That's a 40% increase as I mentioned. As you know, during the quarter, MetLife completed its split off of substantially all of the company's 52% interest in RGA. As a result, our share of the operating earnings of RGA in the third quarter of approximately $24 million or $0.03 per share is now reflected in discontinued operations. All previous periods have also been re-classed into discontinued operations. The split-off transaction results in a GAAP loss of $458 million and a decrease in MetLife share count of approximately 23 million shares. With regard to investment gains and losses, in the third quarter, we had net realized investment gains of $456 million after tax. Included in that were gross losses of $465 million and write-downs of $1 billion, which Steve has already explained in detail. Losses were offset by derivative gains of 745 million after tax, which arose primarily from the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar in the third quarter, as well as an increasing credit spreads. We also announced our annual common dividend of $0.74 per share this year, keeping it flat with last year. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings are approximately $1.6 billion after tax this quarter and $3 billion for the first three quarters of 2008. A large portion of this quarter's statutory earnings were caused by the RGA split-off. And as I am sure you all know and as Rob mentioned, we completed a $2.3 billion equity offering a couple of weeks ago. With this money and including existing excess capital and the $1 billion we'll receive from the convert in February of 2009, we believe we have total excess capital of approximately $6 billion, above what is necessary to maintain the AA rating. In summary, the fundamentals of our business remains strong and despite the market environment, we continue to benefit from our strong diversification. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. With that, we'll go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse - North America: Good morning. Just wanted to ask a few questions around equity market sensitivity. First is, can you comment on just based on the extent of the equity market declines so far in Q4, is there an impact to your statutory capital. That's first question. And then second, Bill I guess just a follow up on your comments on DAC. I can appreciate that you all are truing this up every quarter. But, aren't we getting close to breaking through certain corridor in terms of longer term assumptions for DAC amortization? And if so, is there a risk that we could see a much larger charge perhaps in 4Q, if you do reset assumptions? Thanks.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Tom. Yeah, okay. So stock capital, yeah we clearly have...quarter-to-date, if things stayed where we are in terms of the equity markets, we would certainly see an impact to our stat reserves regarding our variable annuity business. I guess or probably maybe I should size that a little bit for you. And this is...obviously we don't really recalculate RBC. It's actually... it's a long involved process, but we obviously make estimates about RBC. We have a person who does that. That's their full time job is to calculate and project RBC for us, various legal entities. We... think about it this way. We have a... in the third quarter, we had a 9% decline in the S&P 500 and that triggered for us we had to... we needed to increase our stat reserve, call it 3 or 4 RBC points, okay. And for us an RBC point is a little bit over $50 million. Okay, so that's sizing this for you. Now, the relationship is not completely linear of this way. So if you talked about... so you are like... so quarter-to-date, we've had a 19% decline in the S&P 500 I think and so if you know, if you sort of doubled the third quarter impact, you'd be left with sort of a 6 to 8% increase in our decline in RBC points. And again, the relationship... it's not completely linear, so it's higher than that. It might be something like 10 to 12 points, okay. A 10 point impact RBC is now roughly 500 million or $0.5 billion of additional stat reserves, you got to put up, but the number is probably a little higher than that. Okay, so that kind of size it for you in terms of if the markets stay where it is, the additional stat reserves we'll have to put up. I would just say a couple of things about that. A lot of the impact on stat is driven by, how do you reinsure the structure of our reinsurance program, how thoroughly you reinsure your writers and we think we insure them very thoroughly or hedge them thoroughly. And then obviously, the kind of writer contracts you have, we're mainly a GMIB company. Okay, which probably at the end of the day means lower stat reserves than maybe withdrawal benefits have, so all that kind of gets factored in. So to just kind of sum up on this. If you think about 0.5 billion, maybe a little more in terms of additional stat impact and you compare that with sort of our $6 billion of excess capital, so this is the same, but it's certainly a manageable thing for us, given the current environment. So hopefully that will kind of give you some sense of that. Now with regard to DAC, the way we... we obviously calculate the DAC impact every quarter and so we look at what the market returns were and we change our DAC amortization. We also use what's called the mean reversion formula to kind of calculate that. And we are clearly one end of the spectrum of the mean reversion formula, not technically a quarter. So what that means is, the impact of DAC... the impact of the marketplace has a greater effect on the rate of DAC amortization as we kind of get to the end of our mean reversion range. So yes, if the stock markets stay where it was, you would see an increase in DAC, I mean just give you a sense of that, a 9% increase... decline, a 9% decline in the stock market in the third quarter caused or triggered about $120 million pre-tax incremental, okay and that's both on annuities... and most of it is on annuities, but some of it is on life. So again if you double that, you'd be talking crudely $240 million, okay. And actually... because you are at the end of the range, it would actually be a little higher than that. So you do see this kind of increase in DAC amortization flowing through the income statement. So it could have an impact on your fourth quarter results. So hopefully, that will give you some sense of the numbers.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse - North America: That's helpful and just a quick follow up. So we wouldn't be looking at, resetting assumptions but rather probably coming back within the high end of the corridor, would that be the right way to think about it?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. That's exactly right. We don't... again we don't call it and I'm not sure why don't we call it a corridor, but we don't. And not ask us, I know other people do and I'm not sure that they are doing the same thing we are. It's a mean reversion range, and so we are... yes, so because we are at one end of the range the DAC adjustment is flowing right through. There is no sort of smoothing impact which you normally get with the mean reversion formula. So it's coming right through.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse - North America: Right.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: But there is no build up of... let me put it this way, there is no build up of DAC that we need to kind of release. Okay, it's... obviously that's the good part of doing it every quarter. We've been releasing it all along.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse - North America: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Suneet Kamath with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein: Thanks. Maybe two quick ones. First, if you could just comment on your variable annuity hedging program and how that works relative to how many increases you've seen in volatility and if you think your pricing of the writers is appropriate. And then secondly, maybe more of a philosophical question on excess capital. You talked about $6 billion inclusive of the convert next year. How much of that excess capital you think is really redeployable at this point in time, just given the uncertainties sort of rating agencies concerns. I mean is really a 350 RBC ratio, where a AA company needs to be or is it something higher than that? Just any thoughts on that would be helpful. Thanks.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I think... thanks Suneet. There is a lot of questions in what asked. So maybe I'll let Sam talk about kind of a hedging program and so how it's working out. I'd say we had about... we think we had about $0.02 of hedge breakage. We actually did... we normally brag we never have hedge breakage, but we actually did have about $0.02 worth on the annuities, and then maybe Lisa will talk a little bit about annuity pricing and volatility and what that might mean and I'll come back to the... I'll do the philosophical is 350 RBC amount.
Unidentified Company Representative: Good morning. As you know, we do balance economic hedges with high tenacity accounting. It's varies by product. If you look at various products that we offer, we've offer about everything. Our GMDB benefits are hedged sometimes to reinsurance and we've also done some capital markets reinsurance as well. Our GMIB products we've had different generations, our older generation, yeah we've had a pretty effective delta hedging program. With our newer generation, there is some additional features that allows us to do split accounting and some of it is in embedded derivative. And where we have an embedded derivative, we're able to do a full three Greek [ph] match. As Bill said, our program has worked pretty well. Our basis differences have been fairly small and the impact in the third quarter was only over $0.02 a share. And in terms of the pricing, our variable annuity hedges, I just want to remind you that to the extent that we are hedging, we generally do long dated hedges. So any kind of increase in volatility that causes an increase in our hedging cost, nearly affects the new business that we've written recently. And certainly, our individual business associates are considering the pricing of those writers.
Lisa M. Weber - President of Individual Business: Yes. I would just add that in this current environment, it would be imprudent not to look at raising the fees there and we will continue as we have with different products like long-term care. We'll continue to make the difficult decisions even if they're not popular.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. So I've had some time to think about whether 350 RBC is the right number. It's... obviously the rating agencies make that call, I don't. But I'll give you my opinion, maybe they are listening. We've actually raised... something you kind of got to get, you need a little sense of history here. Three, four years ago, we used to mange to 300% RBC ratio and the bar is kind of get over the environment of the last few years, the bar has been raised. It went from 300 to 325, now 325 to 350. I am living with 350 now for, I think, about two years. So and I think that to some extent that to the rating agencies great credit. They've sort of said it, the products are little more interesting, they are a little more volatile. We think a higher capital question is warranted. And a lot of people have created economic capital models and said that showed a 350 is way in excess of what you need. Now I can only point on whether that makes any sense or not, but that kind of tells you that is 350 enough. So in our minds, we look at our business mix and our diversification, and even in this what I would call, pretty crazy tail in the environment we're in and we're still making money, and we are still building capital, and it kind of lets me to believe that 350 is probably okay, and an appropriate number. In our discussions with the rating agencies, they are not... this isn't coming up as a discussion point like well, maybe you need to be north of 350. That's not where our discussions have been. They've actually been very constructive and positive, so I guess I think it's enough. We're obviously holding up... you'll say well, 350 is enough, why are you holding $6 billion more? And look, this goes back to what we said in the equity capital rates. We want to be perceived as the strongest life insurance company out there. And we think in the coming world where I think people are going to focus a lot more on structure than may be price, this is going to work to our great benefit and that's how we want to be positioned.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee: Hi. Good morning. I've got a couple quick questions. First is, MetLife I think is a federally regulated bank holding company. I was wondering your thoughts on or if you would comment on whether you'd submit an application for funds under the TARP program, and if you'd be interested in that if it was made available for the life insurance space. That's question number one.
Robert C. Henrikson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I was waiting for the question number two, John.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee: I was waiting for your response to figure out exactly which way I want to go.
Robert C. Henrikson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I see, okay, maybe it's a good idea for me to respond to that and there is a lot of discussion out there in the press and so forth, so let me just respond. As you pointed out and as many of you know, but some may not have recognized, MetLife is a bank holding company. It is our understanding that the guidelines in the federal statute allow the company access to the capital purchase program. But other than that, I have no comment on the federal program. What I can tell you is what has been discussed in several ways before and on this call is that we're well capitalized. We have a strong balance sheet. We have financial strength ratings that are clearly among the highest in the industry. Bill talked about the successful common stock offering of 2.3 billion and that was on top of the excess that we already have as of September 30th '04. So I think that's... other than that, I have no comment on the federal program.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee: Okay. A separate one, but probably somewhat related. There's also an FDIC program available right now that I think is guaranteeing debt issuance. Are you eligible under that as well?
Robert C. Henrikson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I don't want to... let me take another crack at all kinds of such programs and what not out there. As long as your notes would show, if you've been following this company, I would say that, I always say any kind of question around funding our financing, any kind of questions around acquisitions, anything that even looks or smells sort of like an acquisition including close-out opportunities and what not, we always say the same thing. Certainly I do, that we explore every avenue, we explore all options and everything we do. That's what it's all about to run a major company and then other than that, I don't have any comment on the federal program.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee: Okay, all right. Maybe to go back to the philosophical sort of piece of the discussion earlier, do you think, I mean your top line growth, Rob, you've hit on it pretty specifically at the open. Do you think that you're already seeing in that top line growth the benefits of sort of your competitive advantage, given the strength of the capital, the strength of the brand? And if so, I guess it'd be impossible to quantify. But, I guess it just goes to the question of that do you think or already seeing it?
Robert C. Henrikson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee: Okay. And then the last one is just a quick one on debt to capital levels. Bill, you guys used to have a table in the supplement that at least provided us some adjustments to get to debt to capital ratio. I think you guys used to focus on... you're probably still do, focus on the Moody's level for that. Any chance you can give us an update on where you guys stand relative to that sort of 25% typical target.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. We dropped that number. I mean we used to have our own leverage ratio and I thought that mine was the best. But it couldn't convey to anybody else that. So they... so we started to stop because obviously we are governed by what the rating agencies think the leverage ratio should be. The Moody's ratio right now is sort of pro forma the equity offering would be... the leverage ratio of about 23.9%. They like it, it's not a bright line, but they like us to be 25 or lower. And so that gives you a sense of what our leverage is.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee: Okay. And last real quick one, if in your discussions with the rating agencies, sort of the 350 is actually... you mentioned it's not something that's coming... that's really coming out. What are they key sort of two or three topical areas where you sense that they're most focus with respect to you and maybe more broadly the industry right now? Thank you.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I got your point. For us, they really... they want to understanding what's going on the SEC lending and why we are... and what's happening there. And because they [Technical Difficulty] the world knows, it was in the paper today. Securities lending activity is shrinking around the globe. And so, they wanted to make sure that wasn't causing of any harm. I think we've reassured them and I think hopefully all of you that our SEC lending issues are very well controlled. We've done a great job in my mind of managing down the size of the program without triggering any meaningful capital losses and we've really made sure that we have the liquidity necessary to deal with that very effectively. So I think that's going extremely well. I think with regard to... the other thing I think more broadly is just what we're hearing in the conference calls this quarter, are what's going on with the equity... the potential statutory capital impact was going out of the equity markets. And so I think that's also a discussion point and I'm sure they are having that with others not just us. And yes, they are interested in credit loses and stuff like that. But I would say they are kind of get it. They know it's... they understand that is our business obviously. So they kind of, they have a good feel for what's going on there. And they realize we are in a highly unusual time.
John Nadel - Sterne Agee: All right,thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Colin Devine with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Good morning. Couple of quick ones I would think. First on, with the benefit ratio spiking up, should we start to be concerned that that's a reflection of the economy with MET being more I think, it was a large case company, this maybe a trend that continues for a while?. Second, if you could give us a little bit more detail on pension close-outs, you spoke perhaps for the quarter but also the outlook and the pipeline. And then on capital, Bill and RBC, I would take it now that your original plan with the convert was to avoid the dilution from it. And now, you're planning to just go with that. But then also when you talk about the $6 billion of excess, it would seem to me that if we look at what as you laid out earlier what may be happening to RBC in the fourth quarter, to really some of that $6 billion spoken for, you're going to have to put it down into the life company to keep that RBC number above 350. Is that fair?
William J. Mullaney - President, Institutional Business: It's stimulating. Let me start with the question that you asked about disability and about close-outs. In terms of disability, some of what we're seeing maybe a function of the trends that we're seeing in the economy we talked before about the fact that disability is a product that when the economy get soft, you do see some impact on your claims. In this particular quarter, the ratio did spike up to 95 [Technical Difficulty] of our range, but it does move from quarter-to-quarter. We do see some volatility in that range and what I would say is there wasn't any [Technical Difficulty] thing that drove the results up. Incidence was up a little bit, recoveries were down and the size of the recoveries were down, and all of those things together put some pressure on the ratio. We're watching it very closely, we are increasing some of our assumptions as it relates to these things where the economy is going to affect related to our prices for 2009. So it's something that I think we're keeping a very close eye on. In terms of close-outs, we had a very good quarter for close-outs, almost $700 million in close-outs for the quarter in both the U.S. and the UK. I would say that the pipeline for close-outs continues to be good. A lot of good conversations with main customers, both in the U.S. and the UK around the pension plans, what they're thinking about and what they might do in the future. So we feel pretty good that they'll continue to be good activity in the close-out area.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. And then finally about capital, yes, with regard to the convert, a year ago I would have said, we would have offset the dilution from that conversion of the convert by doing buybacks. I think now, it's probably just better to keep the money obviously, so we'll do that. We'll keep the money. And in the shares outstanding, we'll increase a little bit. With regard to that $6 billion and the fact that we'll have some surplus strength, yes, I think that's right. I mean I think if... it's hard to... I think some of that $6 billion may have to go down in the statutory reserves. But technically, it doesn't... I don't think that will mean we have to put some money down in the holding company. We run... if we... rule of thumb, our RBC ratio, we're managing to sort of the high 300, sort of in the 390 range. It's a little different at the different legal entities. RBC ratio, so there is probably... we think there would be enough cushion down in the insurance subsidiaries right now to deal with this surplus problem. We wouldn't have still have to move any money down. The full $6 billion is not at the holding company; some of the cushion is sitting there in the insurance company.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: And then is it fair to say the 6 could be more like $5 billion, which is still obviously quite a large amount, but 6 maybe closer to 5?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, yes, probably closer to 5 right now. I think that's probably fair. So it's... obviously we'll see how the quarter ends. But yes, I mean 500, 600, $700 million sort of because of this issue is certainly possible.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. In terms of your M&A appetite, which is I think Rob has indicated in the past. So it's primarily internationally oriented. Has that changed and perhaps expanding what Rob said earlier, would you consider something like the capital purchase program to help finance an acquisition if that was available?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Rob we can't comment.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: I think that's okay. Thank you.
Robert C. Henrikson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I'm not commenting because I think you'll repeat myself.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: I'll take that as an affinitive, yes. Okay. In terms of that domestic versus international. Any change?
Robert C. Henrikson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Sorry, we were laughing, so we didn't hear your full question. Would you repeat your last question?
Colin Devine - Citigroup: In terms of your acquisition appetite, I think it's been primarily internationally oriented? Has that now changed, as are you also looking domestically?
Robert C. Henrikson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think the... let me... in terms of what we've looked at both over time, both internationally and domestically, I wouldn't characterize that our focus has been entirely on or even so heavily weighted to international, because we look at opportunities both domestically and internationally. But remember, I've always said in times passed, and it's probably a little bit different dynamic today that domestically you have to have a willing seller and a willing buyer and you have to have an attractive price. And so, the question about price and the question about the willing seller has been a pretty dominant feature in terms of the domestic market in particular and maybe today we see something different there.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We next go to line of Jeff Schuman with KBW. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Good morning. I have a question for Steve and I'd like to follow up. I'm just wondering, MetLife like a lot life insurers have been kind of in a cash conservation mode. I am wondering if you are at a point now where you kind of get the cash position closer to where you wanted and whether you might start to be more active investing in certain markets and where you might be looking first?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: The cash raise had something to do as well with the securities lending program. So as we've mentioned, we're going to be shrinking that base. And again when you think about that program, we have a security we owned, we lend it out we get back cash collateral, we reinvest that cash collateral into other securities. So that since our balance sheet grows based upon that program, as that program comes down, so will that cash to some degree. You know exactly where that number will end up but there will likely be some cash left over at the end of the redemption of the program. At that point most certainly start looking at relative value across the different asset categories and decide where to put the money. We're likely to put that money in this environment in securities we feel are as safe as possible. As we feel all factors are being hit by spread widening. I don't think that means all sectors are equally vulnerable to default and delinquencies and losses. So most likely we will look at sectors such as now government backed RMBS with more exclusively government guarantee than previously. We'll look at sectors like AAA rated credit cards first to pay for of stack and we'll look at other kind of securities that are very high up in the structure in terms of credit enhancement, where we feel that the possibility of loss is lowest, can be possible in this marketplace. So that's where we'll put the money when we finish rightsizing the securities lending program.
Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: And I'm wondering, I guess how much relationship there is between the I guess recent sort of inactivity of life insurers in some of these markets and the unrealized losses that have increased for life insurers. Now it just strikes me that life insurance is kind of a victim that what's happening in the markets. But they've also contributed to market levels by kind of withdrawing from some of these markets. I mean is it too optimistic to think that if we kind of roll through the fourth quarter as insurers get more active that they could actually contribute to some additional strength in recovering some of these fixed income markets or is that too optimistic?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: WellI think you're asking kind of broad question about what's really occurred here with the credit crisis and the lack of liquidity in markets. So let me just talk a little bit about credit spreads because this unrealized loss you're seeing balloon in our balance sheet as well as other financial firms' balance sheets, really relates to that. So you can think about credit spreads in two ways. One related to fundamentals, meaning it's portending higher actual losses on the securities defaults, losses in terms of recoveries and so on. The second piece is a supply demand imbalance, lots and lots of sellers as people de-lever the balanced sheets, whether it be commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds. While we are not de-levering in a major way at MetLife, the fact that we're shrinking the securities lending program in a small way suggest that we're taking a little bit of our asset base down. So lots and lots of our seller securities, almost no buyers right now. In the spread, if you look at in the marketplace driving those unrealized losses, probably do have some fundamental basis to them. But I think the majority of the spread widening relates to supply demand imbalance. And once... I think the banks get recapitalized, once the fear factors have to come down with the intervention of U.S. government and other governments across the globe, I believe these markets will start going back to more normal kinds of spreads giving fundamentals, not purely based upon these supply demand imbalances.
Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: That's great. Thanks a lot, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to the line of Mark Finkelstein with FPK. Please go ahead.
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Good morning. Steve, you talked about repositioning the fixed maturities portfolio, kind of going into more recessionary times. I'm just curious what you're doing with alternative assets either as money becomes available to be pulled out or cash from the LBO funds gets delivered?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: We've make commitments in certain categories such as LBO funds, where there are draw downs as you know. So, obviously we will honor all those commitments and that will go on for a number of years as those partnerships continue. I'll tell you that there haven't been a lot of draw downs lately because not a lot of deals are getting done in that area. There is very little credit availability to anyone. So the LBO players simply aren't doing deals right now by and large. In the area of hedge funds, we are likely to bring that program down somewhat. And we're going to look closely at the performance of the different hedge fund partnerships we invest in. We're going to make some decisions about who want to remain with going forward. I think that hedge fund area in general is going to shrink in the coming quarters, in the coming year or two. And there will be a shake out to some degree and we're evaluating which firms to remain with us as an investor. So, it's likely that program will shrink somewhat over the coming few quarters on our balance sheet. But in general we have not been making a lot of investments in the alternative area. Again, not a lot of capital is being put out in the marketplace either. So the fund raising actually is very, very limited at this point in time.
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Okay. In RNS premium and deposits were very strong, I think $13 billion according to your kind of policyholder account balance reconciliation. Can you just discuss what you're seeing as seeing money is coming from other competitors, but is that trend continuing post the quarter, just what are we seeing there?
William J. Mullaney - President, Institutional Business: Yes, we actually saw some pretty good... this is Bill Mullaney... pretty good net flows in the quarter for RNS. And getting back to the comment that Rob made earlier in terms of flight to quality. There are some companies out there that have been speaking with us about potentially moving money and so there are some counterbalances though, we have funding agreements in that portfolio and we are seeing some redemptions on our funding agreements as well. So I think you'll see some movement both ways in terms of some inflows, in terms of money moving to us in the flight to quality way and then you'll see some other movements downward because companies will be redeeming things like funding agreements to have greater levels of liquidity. So it's likely that the RNS fund balances will probably, we think, stay relatively flat for the next couple of quarters.
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Okay. And then Bill just, if you would to look out 3 to 6 months from now, do you have any projection of where you think the securities lending portfolio might be. I think you're at $41 billion at the third quarter. I don't know if you gave an update as to where you are today. But if you have that, that would be great. And then where do you think we could end up in terms of the size of this portfolio?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: This is Steve. Let me take that one. It's $31 billion as we mentioned now and we think it will shrink over the course of the reminder of this year, perhaps even below the $25 billion level before going back up during 2009 to roughly $25 billion in average of the course of 2009. That's our best case... our best guess if you will, at this point in time. Obviously, this program is driven by two things. One, the securities that we hold in general account that are lendable, if you will, that fit into the categories of lendable securities. And the second thing is the demand on the other side, our counterparties in terms of need for these securities, and given credit market issues, given hedge fund issues beneath those securities as much low today in the headwind in the past. So will there be some recovery there? We think yes. But at minimum, securities such as treasuries, agencies and government-backed residential mortgage-backed securities are likely still to be lendable going forward. Question mark around corporate securities. So even if you exclude corporate securities, we think we'll probably be around the $25 billion level as a norm for the foreseeable future. But the number could actually dip below that in the interim.
Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to line of Ed Spehar with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Edward Spehar - Merrill Lynch: Thank you, good morning. I think I have a few quick numbers questions. I was hoping that you could give us and if it's not the precise number, at least ballpark, of what the variable annuity account balances are with living benefit guarantees. And again roughly, if you don't have exact what the spilt is between IB and WB. And then I've a couple other quick ones.
Unidentified Company Representative: Sure Ed. This is Tim Schmidt. The total living benefit composition of the VA balances would be about 42%. About $39 billion in total and the split between GMIB writers and the other with draw benefit writers would be about just a little under 50-50 of the total number.
Edward Spehar - Merrill Lynch: A little under 50-50 that IB to WB.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, it would be about 18 of the 38 or so that I quoted.
Edward Spehar - Merrill Lynch: Is IB.
Unidentified Company Representative: Is IB, yes.
Edward Spehar - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then, Bill, I wanted to make sure I understood the $6 billion roughly excess that you're talking about, is that as of the end of the third quarter, is it as of today where the S&P is? I'm not sure where that $500 million potential hit whether that was in that or not?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's not because obviously you got to pick a point in time sometime. So we... I would say it as of the end of the third quarter, so the --
Edward Spehar - Merrill Lynch: Okay.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So the $500 billion plus kind of effective statutory impact that might be a little higher than that, would be a subtraction from the fixed numbers.
Edward Spehar - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then could you comment on, just on your capacity to issue preferred securities, given where you are with your balance sheet. How much of this stuff could you issue? If you're would going to... obviously not issuing the buyback stock, but issuing for other reasons.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well that's an interesting question. I would have said that in sort of a normal world, given the guidelines as sort of what I would call a hybrid basket, if you will, of what the preferred with inner. And also Moody's, it doesn't necessarily have a hybrid basket, but they have something... they want to look at the cash hold cover ratio of the holding company and those would lead you to believe... if you kind of thought those were a hard guidelines, you'd say, the number is $2 million to $3 billion, something like that in terms of the capacity. But I view those as guidelines. You're not going to like it Pirates of the Caribbean, so the guidelines. So there, --
Edward Spehar - Merrill Lynch: Sort of the high bro references I can always count on for you.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, my kids want you. So there... we live in a world where that maybe... that number may be different okay than $2 billion to $3 billion. And depending on what happen to that cash that would probably be okay with the rating agencies I bet.
Edward Spehar - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then the final question is, I mean I suspect that less than it used to be, but there was a time when you would talk about a lower RBC ratio as being okay relative to some others because of the unrealized real estate gains in the portfolio. Can you talk a little bit about how anybody is looking at that right now?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Steve is going to give you the number as part of what he thinks the unrealized gains on the real estate portfolio. I mean just for everybody's benefit, we have a lot of equity real estate which we hold at booked. We've had a pretty successful track record I think in terms of realizing gains at very big numbers. But... and so, we're pretty good at that and there's a lot of value there. That does not get counted in the RBC ratio obviously and we don't sort... we view it as a thing that's there, but we don't try to take credit for it and that's obviously there in our what we call our excess capital number because in my mind, that's not readily accessible, okay, especially in this environment. So but Steve?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: We tracked that number every quarter. It's come down a little bit, but it's still at $3.3 billion as pre-tax. And as Bill mentioned, the liquidity in this marketplace obviously right now is not great. Lending is limited, but in terms of fundamental value even in this market with declining prices, we still have a number of $3.3 billion as an unrealized gain net pre-tax.
Edward Spehar - Merrill Lynch: Okay thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And we have time of one final question from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan: Hi. Thank you. I had a couple of questions for Lisa. The first one is on your variable annuity sales. Based on industry numbers, it looks like the industry's preliminary number, the industry is going to be down in the mid to high single-digits. Your sales I think were up almost 7% sequentially. I don't think there was a special orienting. But if you could comment on what drove that? And then I have a follow up after that.
Lisa M. Weber - President of Individual Business: Sure, yes. There is a couple of things going on with our variable annuity sales. And we did have some enhancements in the second quarter to our GMIB. We added the $1000 death benefit and we also improved the LWG. But really what our sales increase is attributable to, I would say even more so is this whole opportunity in terms of the flight to quality and it's where the MetLife brand is really standing strong with all the market turmoil what clients are really looking for guarantees and safe havens and that's evident by the increase in the writer take rate. And so while Tim talked about the balances, we were up to an all-time high of almost an 86% take rate on the writers. So, it's that in addition our wholesalers are solid. More of them want to work here and have joined us and so our narrow and deep strategy with our focus firms has as well on the independent side. And so that we do believe that what you'll see in Q3 as we also saw our in 2Q is that again, we will gain market shares. So we felt really terrific about our annuity sales overall, both variable and fixed.
Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan: And then lastly, just on the living benefits. Has... there is sort of a high volatility in the market, maybe you rethink about the features that you are offering or at least raised prices. A few of your competitors have been thinking about raising prices, what are your thoughts on the long-term profitability of offering living benefits? And then secondly, the prices that you're charging for those.
Lisa M. Weber - President of Individual Business: Yes, as I commented a little bit earlier, we are looking at increasing our pricing now as we speak given the current environment and we will not sacrifice our profitability here. And so, we're going to make the decisions that we need to make and execute on the decisions and so you'll hear more about that as we go forward.
Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan: And then lastly, if I could ask one more, just on your variable investment income, it was obviously below plan this quarter and if you look at the market overall, IPO activity is pretty much non-existent, you also have a decline in your securities lending book. So, obviously the fourth quarter is going to be weak, but what needs to happen for variable investment income to return to like the $300 million, $350 million range next year or is that even a likely range, the macro environment right now?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: As we look into the fourth quarter, we don't see a bounce back in the hedge funds space or in the corporate joint venture LBO space. And for that those areas to improve and the equity markets have to improve dramatically as do the sub-debt market for the LBO player. And I think that's going to be sometime before that turns around. As I mentioned earlier, in December at our investor day, I will give a new plan for variable income for 2009.
Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And I'll turn it back to you Mr. Murphy.
Conor Murphy - Investor Relations: Okay thank you. Just a remainder to please join us at our investor day on Monday, December 8th and that's it. Thank you very much.

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-07-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results, and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time-to-time in MetLife, Inc.'s filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife Incorporated specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Conor Murphy, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead
Conor Murphy: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2008 earnings call. We are delighted to be here this morning to talk about our results for the quarter. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplement, both of which are available on our website at MetLife.com, on our Investor Relations page. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment related gains and losses which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments, we will take your questions. Here with us today to participate in the discussion are Bill Mullaney, President of our Institutional businesses; Lisa Weber, President of Individual; Bill Toppeta, President of International, and Bill Moore, President of Auto and Home. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert C. Henrikson: Thank you, Conor and good morning everyone. During the second quarter, MetLife increased its top line results by 10%, as premium fees and other revenues reached a record $9.5 billion. We also generated $942 million in operating earnings. Despite weakness in the credit and equity markets, our balance sheet continues to demonstrate its strength. Our portfolio remains well position and I am pleased with this performance. MetLife's strong capital position is substantial, and our book value has grown to $46.51 per share. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I'd like to highlight a few examples. In institutional, we had a strong across the board top line growth. Premium fees and other revenues in group life rose 8%. Looking at non-medical health, our top line increased 14% driven mainly by organic growth especially in dental. Turning to retirement and savings, we continued to see significant activity in the pension close-out space, as we secured new business in both the U.S and the U.K in the second quarter. In individual business, variable annuity deposits were up from first quarter level. We also saw strong positive net flows in the second quarter. Given the challenging equity markets, we are pleased with our variable annuity performance this quarter. In terms of our life products, sales were up slightly as compared with the second quarter of 2007. We are seeing strong interest in our newly launched universal life product, and we continue to benefit from the broad reach that our multiply distribution channels provide. In international, we had record top line results, and increased operating earnings by 26%. Our market leading positions in Latin America continued to drive significant growth, in our international business. In Mexico and Brazil, we added several new group customers and increased year-over-year sales considerably in both countries. In Asia, we had annuity deposits of $1.4 billion in Japan, consistent with last year levels. And on May 29th, we began to distribute our VA product through the Japan posts. While the current economic environment may remain volatile, we will continue to benefit from our diverse mix of related global businesses. Looking ahead, they will continue to serve us well as we remain disciplined, focused on our bottom line and committed to providing value for our shareholders. Let me now turn it over to Steve Kandarian.
Steven A. Kandarian: Thanks, Rob. I would like to provide you with an update on our portfolio against performance of the last quarter. First, let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pre-tax variable income was approximately $30 million lower than planned for Q2, primarily driven by lower corporate joint venture income. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect that corporate joint venture income to moderate during the remainder of the year, due to tighter credit conditions, volatile equity markets and general economic conditions. On the other hand, income from our securities lending program outperformed plan, due to a steeper yield curve and higher spreads in the reinvestment portfolio. As of June 30th, we had approximately $44 billion of securities on loan to 12 counter parties, which were all rated A or higher. In return for these securities, we received cash which was primarily reinvested in a portfolio of fixed income securities. Our securities lending reinvestment portfolio is somewhat more conservative than the remainder of the general account assets; with an average rating of AA minus. We anticipate maintaining the size of our program during the second half of the year and are comfortable with our holdings and the liquidity of the business. Now, let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses were $346 million, of which only $48 million were credit-related sales. Write-downs this quarter were $262 million and remained modest relative to the overall size of our portfolio. Of this amount, $221 million were credit related impairments including $82 million of financial institutions, $23 million of home builders and only $12 million of subprime related holdings. The non-credit related write-downs of $41 million consisted of impairments of common stock holdings; the vast majority of which were held in the close block. When added together, total credit-related losses from sales and write-downs were $269 million before tax or $175 million after tax. Unrealized losses for fixed maturities increased by just under $1 billion in the quarter to $9.7 billion, versus the first quarter 2008. While spreads generally declined from the end of the first quarter, interest rates rose across most of the curve, leading to higher unrealized losses. While the impact of interest rates changes on our assets is reflected in other comprehensive income on our balance sheet, the corresponding impact on liabilities is not reflected on our financial statements. Next, I would like to review with you our impairment process. Each quarter, our asset write down committee which oversees MetLife's investment impairment process, determines which assets will be impaired. We consider a wide range of factors in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security, and in accessing the prospects for near term recovery. The factors we consider in the impairment process include the length of time and extent of the unrealized loss, the financial condition of the issuer and whether we received and believe we will continue to receive all anticipated cash flows. We also consider our ability and intent to hold the security, until its value recovers to book value. If we believe it is likely that we will not collect all future contractual cash flows, or if we do not have the ability and intend to hold the security until recovery, the asset is impaired, and the loss flows through our income statement. Finally, let me discuss our credit portfolio. As we've mentioned in the past, we've had concerns about the corporate credit environment for sometime. Accordingly, we reduced our allocation to BBB credit from 15% to 13.8% of the managed assets between September 30th, 2007 and June 30th, 2008. Similarly, we've reduced our low investment grade credit from 5.7% to 4.7% of managed assets during the same period. In conclusion, we believe our fundamental analysis, proactive portfolio management and risk management efforts have positioned us well for the current economic environment. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.
William J. Wheeler: Thanks, Steve and good morning everybody. MetLife reported $1.30 of operating earnings per share, a 24% decline from the second quarter of 2007. As I go through the quarter's results with you this morning, you will see that the fundamentals of MetLife's business are strong. However, our results this quarter do reflect the continued decline of the equity markets, higher implying catastrophes and certain one-time items that occurred during the quarter. Let me begin with top line revenues, which we define as premium fees and other income. Top line revenues were $9.5 billion this quarter, an increase of 10% over the second quarter of 2007. Year-to-date, revenues are up 10.8% for the first six months of... over the first six months of 2007, which is excellent. In international, top line revenues increased 19% over the prior year quarter to $1.2 billion. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected revenue growth by approximately 4 points. International revenue growth was driven largely by strong performance in both the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. In institutional, top line revenue growth of 16% over the year ago a period was driven by solid revenue growth across all of its major product areas. High pension closeout sales during the quarter increased retirement and the savings revenue by 65% to $553 million. Non-medical health and other had a 14% increase in premium over the second quarter of 2007, driven by dental which was bolstered by a recent acquisition. Core growth in group life resulted in an increase of revenues of 8% over the year ago period. Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results. In institutional, our group term life mortality ratio of 91.3% was well within our target range of 91% to 95%. However, underwriting results in group life were negatively impacted by an unusually high number of large claims in our specialty product areas. The impact of these large claims were $60 million post tax, or $0.02 a share. In non-medical health and other, group disabilities morbidity ratio of 89.7%, was quite strong and reflects relatively steady reported incidence. In retirement and savings, we made a liability adjustment on a large institutional annuity which has been in force with MetLife for more than 20 Years. The adjustment was triggered by an administrative data true up and reduced earnings by $42 million after tax, or $0.06 per share. In the individual business, our mortality ratio was 89.8%, which is somewhat higher than normal. Although frequency levels were slightly higher than expected, most of the increase came from higher phasing of clients. Turning to auto and home, we experienced an unusually higher level of catastrophes this quarter, resulting in a 99.5% combined ratio. Catastrophe claims were $59 million after tax higher than planned, or $0.08 per share. Partially upsetting this was a favorable prior accident year development release of $26 million after tax or $0.04 per share. The combined ratio excluding the impact of catastrophes and prior year development improved 2 points to 87.3% year-over-year. This was driven by strong core operating results in the auto line of the business. Moving to investment spreads, with regard to variable investment income, the performances of certain variable assets classes was mixed this quarter. As Steve mentioned, private equity returns were well below plan, but securities lending income was very high. Overall, variable investment income was approximately $21 million after DAC, TAC and other offsets or $0.03 per share lower than our baseline plan. Keep in mind that in the second quarter of 2007, variable investment income was $0.18 higher than planned. So the swing between the two periods in this area is large. As to our future outlook, we expect variable income to be below plan in the third quarter which historically has been our seasonally lowest quarter. We currently expect a rebound of variable income in the fourth quarter, but our visibility is not as great here. In addition, we are obviously being affected by the equity markets in our variable annuity and variable life businesses. We estimate that the equity market performance versus our plan reduced EPS by $0.06 this quarter. Moving to expenses, if you recall, we were projecting an expense ratio of 28% to 29% in 2008. Our expense ratio in the second quarter was 29.4%, a little higher than guidance. This was due to higher variable annuity in life DAC amortization caused by the equity markets. I want to make sure that everyone understands, we drew up our annuity DAC balances based on the investment performance of the related separate accounts, every quarter not once a year. So adjusting for the unusually high DAC amortization this quarter, our expense ratio is within guidance and our expenses are well under control. Turning to our bottom line results, we earned approximately $942 million in the operating income or $1.30 per share for the second quarter. With regard to investment gains and losses, in the second quarter, we had net realized investment losses of $233 million after tax. Steve just gave you a detailed explanation of what's included in that number. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings are approximately $750 million after tax this quarter, and are $1.4 billion for the first half of 2008. Total statutory capital and surplus at June 30, is approximately $21.7 billion, which is up $1.4 billion from year-end 2007. We are revising our earnings guidance for the year. We currently expect to report earnings for the second half of 2008 in the range of $2.88 to $3.08 per share. This projection does not include any impact from potential one-time items such as operational excellence. When added to the $2.82 that was earned on an operating basis for the first half of 2008, we expect annual earnings to be in the range of $5.70 to $5.90. Most of the reduction in earnings is driven by equity markets. But roughly 13% decline in the S&P 500 through June 30 versus the annualized 5% increase assumed in our plan is having a big impact. This factor combined with the unusual items this quarter, are causing us to revise guidance. In summary, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we are coping well with the volatile market. And with that, let me turn it back over to Rob, to make some closing remarks.
Robert C. Henrikson: Thank you, Bill. As we announced yesterday, MetLife is undertaking an operational excellence initiative which will help serve as the foundation for our future growth. Let me explain. Last summer, we began a strategic review of MetLife, this ongoing effort is concentrating on our strengths, opportunities and areas for improvement. The strategic review process is the part of the Board's and my focus on preserving and growing shareholder value. We are well positioned to capitalize on the retirement income needs of baby boomers, grow our life insurance franchise and drive growth on a global basis. Despite our tremendous opportunities and achievements, I am not satisfied. MetLife intends to extend its leadership position in the financial services industry in the coming years. In order to accomplish this, we must operate with ever increasing intensity. To that end, under my direction, I created an operational excellence initiative. Since April, a team has been conducting a diagnostic review of all our operations. The team is focused on reducing complexities, leveraging our scale, improving efficiencies and increasing productivity. This initiative begins the transformational change in the way MetLife operates, and I expect that within the next two to three years it will yield both significant revenue enhancements and cost savings. This will require investment, leadership and discipline. Because our plans are not complete, at this time we can not quantify the financial impacts of this initiative. However, we will provide more details when we announce our third quarter results in October and at our investor day meeting in December. Throughout my career, MetLife has demonstrated a powerful capacity to get behind a bold idea and execute. In 2000, we completed the largest demutualization in U.S. history; in 2005 we completed the largest acquisition in our history. Once again, we will leverage the tremendous resources of MetLife to further transform this great company and deliver shareholder value.
Conor Murphy: Thank you, Rob. Julie, let's open it up for questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll go to the line of John Hall with Wachovia. Please go ahead.
John Hall: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I have a couple of questions, quick ones for Bill and then one for Rob. Bill, at the end of each year, as we look forward to earnings, you sort of do an exercise to normalize earnings and then project growth off of that normalized base. Over the last several years, it's been a matter of subtracting to get down to a normalized number. It appears that this year, we might be adding to get to a normalized number. Is that a good way to think about what the base for growth in '09 should be?
William J. Wheeler: Yes. I don't know if we're normalizing yet, but I mean we're probably not subtracting any more. We're... we don't as a rule, try to normalize for equity market performance, because you know it will go up and it will go down obviously. So, we don't try to adjust, but we just try to... we do try to describe and understand the impact. So if you think about the earnings revision that we had here, most of that is driven by the equity market changes. And then, but that's the separate accounts, they're at different levels and so we'll have to grow earnings from here. So I think, one other thing I would probably say is, even with this earnings revision we're still going to have earnings growth, certainly on a normalized basis year-over-year in '08. It's not as great as it was. But the... I don't know if we are going to... I don't know if we'll add back or not, but we'll... we may not do anything
John Hall: Okay. And then can I take from your comments on DAC that there is a 0% chance that we're going to see a DAC charge in the wholesale fashion in the third quarter?
William J. Wheeler: Well that's certainly... just to step back from a little bit, we do... we obviously review our DAC assumptions once a year. We generally do that in the fourth quarter. But that's... what we're looking at there are things like lapse rates and withdrawals and stuff like that. We don't really true up for market and we don't... we wouldn't do a DAC unlocking for market. We do that every quarter. And so, the answer is no. We're not going to... you won't see a DAC unlocking based on market conditions in the third quarter.
John Hall: Thanks. And then Rob, I have a question for you on the operational excellence program and how it relates to the 15% ROE target that's established for 2010 is this... this program is something that will either delay achieving that target in 2010 or accelerate it?
Robert C. Henrikson: It certainly won't delay it and it certainly will accelerate it.
John Hall: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to the line of Eric Berg with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.
Eric Berg: Thanks. I just had one question. you mentioned... and good morning by the way. You mentioned that there was a bit of an earnings hiccup in the specialty life insurance area, I believe on the group side, you will correct me, if it was on the individual side, what is that specialty area; what is its specific business? And I am sure you have taken a very close look at the nature of the claims to determine what might, if anything be going on? Could you just build on your comments? Thank you.
William J. Mullaney: Sure Eric. It's Bill Mullaney and I'll comment on the specialty area because was an institutional business it's our group universal life and group variable universal life contracts which are contracts that we offer primarily to a higher paid and executive people within the corporate accounts that are our customers. And so in this particular quarter, we had a higher number of claims in excess of $1 million than we typically see on an average quarter. And as result of that, that was driving the higher mortality in that segment of our business.
Eric Berg: Now, I'm equally interested in knowing obviously what we all want to hear from you, but you tell us what in fact is going on is that you've studied this situation thoroughly and this is a statistical anomaly and nothing more than that but --
William J. Mullaney: Right. When we look at--
Eric Berg: That we are not happy about.
William J. Mullaney: When we look at this quarter compared to the prior five or six quarters, like I said, the number of high phased amount of claims was roughly double over what we've seen over that average. So we think that it's an anomaly. We think that is really specific to this quarter and not something that we would expect to happen going forward.
Eric Berg: Thank you very much, Bill.
Operator: Thank you. We will go to line of Randy Binner with FBR please go ahead.
Randy Binner: Yes. Hi, thank you, I have a question about the $0.06 that was identified... $0.06 per share that was identified as being related to market volatility in the quarter and how that relates to the rule of thumb we had for every 1% change in the S&P 500 there was a $0.01 effect. I guess the first question is, is that $0.06 is that just from how the market performed relative to plan in the second quarter or is there some of what happened in the first quarter in there? And I guess based on that, I'd be curios to know if there is a new kind of benchmark we can use for EPS relative to a 1% change in the S&P?
William J. Wheeler: Yes sure well, let's kind of give you some... set out some details. In the first quarter, there was almost a 10% decline in the S&P 500 and then of course and then obviously, at the same time we have an expectation that we would have a 5% annualized, but only 1.25% in the quarter returned from the S&P 500. So let's say that was... that triggered basically sort of an $0.11 swing, if you will. Now if you think about how that gets... using the ratio of 1% decrease in the S&P 500 cause us $0.01 a share, sort of plan versus reality, and the... and so I think in the first quarter, we said that we thought that... now, the way that $0.11 gets recognized it's over the course of the year. There is, most of the impact is upfront, but some of the impact is spread out over the rest of the year, and most of that is sort of like the separate account fee income. So $0.06 occurred in the first quarter, but then it going to be an initial $0.05, $0.06 which hits the latter second... the other three quarters, if you will, so that gets spread out. Now this quarter, we had not quite a 4% drop in the S&P 500 in the second quarter versus another expectation of another 1.25% indication, so that would say a $0.05 swing. Okay, and so... but you're now and so that too, most of that hits this quarter, but some of it gets spread out for the rest of the year and then also I had sort of the remaining first quarter effect. So if you kind of run through that math, you'd go to okay well, I get $0.05 how did you get $0.06. And this is sort of your second part of your question. You know this relationship of a 1% change in the S&P 500 versus a 1% move in -- $0.01 move in our earnings, isn't really linear. So when we start to see a substantial deviation from our plan, which we're starting to see now, the DAC amortization actually accelerates. So I would say, right now, changes, further declines in the S&P 500 versus planned for the remainder of the year, the relationship is more like $0.015 and not $1 anymore. So, it is deteriorating a little bit, so that's a little bit why you get something like $0.06 this quarter, and not $0.05. That said, we are all in, we think the overall earnings impact approaches $0.20. I would just bore you with the other fact here is when we built our 2008 plan, it was sort of in the fall of 2007 and almost from that very moment we printed the plan, the stock market started going down. And we didn't really factor that in the guidance because at the time, we didn't think that it wasn't big enough to deal with, but obviously that contributes as well. So, we are a full $0.20 or so, maybe even a little more below plan in terms of impact of the stock market into on our earnings, and that's what driving down the guidance. I hope I didn't confuse you on that.
Randy Binner: No, that's all very helpful. So just to clarify, so this $0.06 when that's communicated is, what happens this quarter and that will be a rate as we go forward?
William J. Wheeler: Yeah, pretty much a rate.
Randy Binner: Okay. And is it like 60% in the first quarter and then 20, I am sorry like 40%, 50% in first quarter and then lagging from there?
William J. Wheeler: Yes, that a good proportion.
Randy Binner: Okay great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Will go to line of Ed Spehar with Merrill Lynch
Edward Spehar: Thank you. Good morning. Bill, you had made some reference to the underwriting this quarter not being as good as some prior quarters, but still being an okay quarter. I am wondering if you could just talk a little bit about, I know you have a range of expectations, but it seems like they have tended to be may be a little bit on the better end and this quarter was not. If we were more toward the better end in underwriting, do you have any sense of what kind of a per share impact we might have seen?
William J. Wheeler: It's hard to quantify, obviously we've talked about this $0.02 adjustment in group life, although but other our normal group term life contracts that I think earnings, I think the mortality rates, we print in the QFS of 91.7% was actually pretty good. In non-medical health, which also has a big underwriting earnings component to it, probably the results say we're just a little softer than planned may be a penny or so which we obviously don't try to normalize for. I would also say in individual, the mortality, we said the mortality was a little worse than normal. Again, we didn't try to add that back or normalize for, but that was probably worth $0.02. Interestingly, auto and home when you kind of, as I mentioned on the call when you cut through the catastrophe losses in the reserve releases, underwriting was actually quite good. And I don't know was it a full penny good, may be not; but that sort of gives you a feel for sort of the other changes. Obviously, we earn underwriting profits in a lot of different ways at MetLife and almost always every quarter this is the kind of the great benefit of being so diverse is, almost always you have something going in one direction and something going the other and they usually balance each other out. I would say, this quarter though was probably on average just not quite as good as our normal quarter, in terms of results. So it... but we're talking of few pennies here and there.
Edward Spehar: And how about in the RNS area, anything there to say on mortality?
William J. Wheeler: Well, obviously we had this reserve adjustment which isn't necessarily underwriting experience that's really... that's a data adjustment. Underwriting there otherwise was okay, I mean we certainly had better quarters, but it was okay.
Edward Spehar: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to the line of Colin Devine with Citigroup Please go ahead
Colin Devine: Good morning. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit more on your international businesses, come up to now about 14% of earnings this quarter and really starting to ramp up. If you can give us some sense of what's going on the underneath that I appreciate it, make a lot of money in Japan I thought you got some great sales. You can talk about some of the other businesses where you are really starting to get some traction now?
William J. Toppeta: Sure Colin. It's Bill Toppeta. I would say if you look at our business, the positive results on the earnings side are pretty wide spread, certainly throughout Latin America and also mostly in most of the countries in Asia Pacific. If I take you back to investor day, we talked about four driver countries; Mexico being the biggest. And I would say, there we're outperforming what we told you back on investor day, especially in the earnings category. In Korea, which is our second biggest, we are pretty much hitting on the plan that we told you so, we are going to be right in that range. In Chile, which was third of those countries, we are going to outstrip the plan by quite a bit, and actually Japan is the one where the earnings are probably going to be a bit below where we told you on that range, but we're making up for that in other countries. So I would say, overall based on the... on what we told you one investor day, we are glean in every category, the only category where I would say we are not glean is sales. And in that category we are positive with the exclusion of Japan, but we're going to be a little bit lower in Japan than what we thought. So I don't know if that's enough color or if you want more detail in specific places I can certainly provide it.
Colin Devine: That helps. I guess the other follow up is Rob has talked about getting that to 25% over the next couple of years and that M&A would be a big part of it. Are you still out there looking certainly by [indiscernible] my I think Mr. Will there that but using our gauge that still leaves in then about $1 billion worth of cash plus to do some deals here, are we going to see something there?
Robert C. Henrikson: Don't encourage him Colin. He... obviously Bill can talk about the deal environment. He and I are both... we were both intimately involved in what's going on international. It's where... we have closed a few deals I mean they are not big ones but which kind of says we're out there looking, we're backing the Mexican foray and this little group dental business we just announced in Brazil, neither of those deals is very material, but I would say they are they kind of indicate that we're active, I don't know you would add to that Bill.
William J. Toppeta: I really wouldn't have anything to add, we are very active and we are not just we are not just sitting and waiting for deals to come for us, we are out looking for them. Having said that, I think it is fair to observe that the environment is a difficult one especially in light of the relative strength of the U.S. dollar to some of the other currencies and also some of the accounting differences between us and European competitors specifically, so we are very, very active but the environment is challenging.
Colin Devine: Thank you.
William J. Toppeta: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Suneet Kamath with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. Two questions. First one for Bill, on the share repurchases, I understand that you are out of the market until the RGA transaction is completed. If that's true, it just appears that capital is going to be building pretty quickly here and especially given the fact that your investment losses are really not that material. Is that going to put some pressure on your full year ROE target? And then I guess for Rob, in your opening comments you had mentioned the operational excellence and I think you said that you are not satisfied with the situation at MetLife and you could see that improve. What specifically are you looking at that made you to comment that you are not satisfied? Thanks.
William J. Wheeler: Suneet I'll go first. In terms of the cap to billing that's right. I mean just to kind of review the bidding here a little bit, on investor day last year, we talked about buying back $2.2 billion of stock and that broke down something like buyback enough stock to defeat the first convert conversion which is happening in August and that we estimated at the time was a $1.4 billion it doesn't... it isn't going to be that. It isn't costing us that much anymore and then $750 million on top of the additional purchases. So fast forward to now, we're... we bought back 1.25 billion of stock so far, we are now in the quiet period of the RGA split off transaction so there is not much I can say about that but obviously that has, in my mind if that transaction is completed it effectively sort of meets our buyback commitment for the year. But we have an extra billion in cash that we hadn't originally planned on. So capital levels, so in terms of ROE targets, if you think about the buyback activity, it's actually essentially on plan for where we were, but we are instead of using cash it's RGA share. But that doesn't mean there's extra cash now that will probably end up at the holding company by year-end. And so that gives us a little more fuel to play with in future. And that obviously it will be used for a couple of different things as it gets redeployed over the next period of time. It will be used to make acquisitions may be international acquisitions or it will get used for additional buyback activity. So that's so that in my mind just... it sort of helps if you think about the long-term ROE store which is really what we're focused on in sort of the 15% target in 2010 and I think that kind of helps us to get there.
Robert C. Henrikson: Suneet, on the word, satisfy, let me... everybody who knows me outside there are a couple of things I will comment on. I have been enthusiastic, I continue to be enthusiastic and I am never satisfied. So if you kind of put those together this is a quite a positive statement. We have... if you look at the tremendous growth that we have achieved and you look at the shift in the business opportunities we have in some areas and you realize that we have a stronger management team today than we ever have had. You put those things together and say some of our processes and some of our legacy methodologies can really be streamlined and brought up-to-date with where we are to give us the capacity to grow more rapidly in the future. So it's one thing to be as I am enthusiastic about being number one in so many areas one, two or three in virtually everything we do so forth and so on; but I don't like being number one and winning by a nose when I feel like we could extend our lead and coming around the third quarter I don't like to look back, I like forward. And so that's what this is all about, we are very enthusiastic about it. We have obviously in looking at the diagnostics and what not, we have some very substantial opportunities and we're going to take advantage of them.
Suneet Kamath: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mark Finkelstein with FPK. Please go ahead.
Mark Finkelstein: Good morning. Couple of quick questions. Firstly, on retirement savings spreads, they came into 1.29% for the quarter obviously I think that was one of areas that was affected by variable income, but what's interesting is actually how low the crediting rate had gone. And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, if the variable income had come in online, what would have been spreads in that business, and what is the spread outlook for the reminder of the year, clearly you were more positive about that on the first quarter call.
Robert C. Henrikson: Yes, it's... I think we just got to give you the history there, I think in on investor day we said that we thought spreads would be 115 or 130 basis point in RNS for the year. Then when they were obviously 151 in the first quarter, we said that well, do we miss that a little bit on the good side and what happened of course is so claiming income was a little better than planned in the first quarter, but also what happened was is that long... short term interest rates dropped much faster than we had originally anticipated in our plan. And there is an aspect of retirement savings where that comes into play. There is, we have some insurance liabilities which are short, which have floating rates and which, we've talked about this before. We run a mismatch on, so when you see us deepening yield curve like we had that should widen spread. So that caused us to sort of revise our outlook for the range to just a 130 to 150 basis points you talked about. We reported 129 as you mentioned for the quarter and if you said, well if had hit plan on variable investment income and we didn't. We were affected by it in RNS. The spread would have been 144 basis points, which is just about in the middle of that range, a little above it in the middle. But that gives you a feel for it. So I think the 130 to 150 sort of range is still valid and but obviously we'll be impacted by... there is a lot of those alternative asset classes which make up variable investment income in the retirement savings investment portfolio so it's sensitive to that.
Mark Finkelstein: Okay. And then just one other clarification going back to Suneet's question, so after the RGA split off transaction occurs, assuming it does occur, the plan is that you will hold the cash flow that you are building and you are not going to kind of go back into the market and execute more share repurchases or is that a little bit early to suggest?
Robert C. Henrikson: Yes. I don't -- we are not I mean I guess we're not going to commit one way or another I think we just have to see how things turn out, at the end of the year and before we... and then we'll make a decision then about what we do.
William J. Wheeler: Obviously we look back moving just thinking about '09 for a minute couple of things are going to happen. We are going to have another, the other leg of the other half of the convertible convert in the early part of the year. Obviously, if we allow that conversion to stand without doing any thing about it, it dilutive to EPS and so obviously we would and I think, when we talked about investor day last December, I think I gave some people a little guidance that said we're not going... we're going to offset that dilution and I don't see any reason why we will still wouldn't do that, whether that means we do that at the end of this year or very early next year, something like that I am its hard to say right now. But so, we certainly have sort of the fire power, if you will, to kind of get back into the market and do cash buy backs. So it's just a matter of thinking about our timing and the situation at the time.
Mark Finkelstein: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Steven Schwartz, Raymond James & Associate. Please go ahead.
Steven Schwartz: Hey good morning everybody. I just want to nail down one more thing on the equity market guidance, Bill. The average daily balance in the market was actually up for the quarter, it was up about 3.2%. So I am trying to reconcile the guidance vis-à-vis the market being down point-to-point. Is what you're saying? I mean are you different from other insurers in the fact that you're truing up to DAC for markets on a quarterly basis, so really the important thing here is the lack of better term to market-to-market on the DAC as opposed to where separate account balances are going or the fees on separate account balances are going?
William J. Wheeler: That's right, I mean the interesting think here is if you think about the impact of market on us, the DAC adjustment far outweighs the separate account fee and the separate account fee, so you are absolutely right I mean the market ran up and then it came down. So the average balances for the quarter was actually okay so separate account fees really weren't affected all that much. But when you're doing the DAC adjustments you are really looking at the endpoints because you're thinking about well given this level of separate accounts what's the future profits we are going to earn of that annuity contract.
Steven Schwartz: Right.
William J. Wheeler: So it's... so the DAC adjustment and you can see it right now in our P&L. I mean separate account year-over-year were still up 1%, so I mean that's not as much as we would like, but it's still a positive number. What's really going on is the DAC adjustments were much bigger.
Steven Schwartz: Okay. And that hits in the quarter as opposed to... mostly in quarter as opposed to be spreading out over time?
William J. Wheeler: That's right.
Steven Schwartz: Okay got you. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Tisha Jackson with Columbia Management. Please go ahead.
Tisha Jackson: Good morning. I had a couple of questions actually for Steve Kandarian. I as hoping you could maybe give us an update on your holdings of both Alt-A and subprime and kind of where these are marked versus original cost? And then also may be kind of update us on, what's going on in your home loan portfolio, your commercial home loan portfolio and also if you can give us any details on holdings of CNBS, AAA, AA and kind of what kind of subordination those things have at this point particularly for the '06 '07 years? And then finally, how much credit card and auto asset-backed securities do you have at this point?
Steven A. Kandarian: Okay, I will try cover it all.
Tisha Jackson: Sorry, it's a lot.
Steven A. Kandarian: It's a lot there. Let me kind of click them off one by one. Alt-A, we had about $5.8 billion of Alt-A last quarter, we're down to about $4.9 billion. Some of that related to sales, some relates to roll off; we have not been buying in the Alt-A market over the last quarter. And in most of our Alt-A, you may recall is super senior, which means we bought additional insurance protection, additional subordination, when we purchased the securities sometime ago. And at the time when we bought these securities, there was a very small premium to buy that super senior turn some times only one or two basis points for that insurance, that has held us in good stead. Overall our subordination, average subordination our portfolio is over 12%, which means, over 12% of actual losses must occur before tranche is impacted. Now historically, the high watermark for losses in Alt-A is about 2.4%. Now, we do not think its going to stop there at this time because the market we believe is in a more negative position than it has been historically, but if you look at the ranges in terms of other people's projections about losses, they ranges from about 2.5% to 10%, 10% can be an outlier in the higher side for losses, and again our average subordination in the portfolio is over 12%. So as we run these impairment processes internally, we look on a security-by-security basis and determine if we think any one of these securities may eventually not pay the full amount of cash flows contractually promised to us, and to date through all of our modeling we have taken mo impairments because we believe in all cases, these securities will be money good. Let me move on to subprime, we are down now to about I think it's a $1.8 billion of subprime. It's been kind of rolling off and the vast majority of that of course is AAA. We brought very little kind of in 2006 and beyond vintages. And what we did buy all those AAA, AA credits. So again as we look at the marketplace and model these things on in terms of impairments, we have taken very few write-downs in this area and really don't anticipate taking meaningful write-downs going forward. Again, we stress these securities are pretty hard. So let me go back to just to show what we're doing running these models. We have made assumptions that even from this point in time, real estate prices, residential real estate prices would drop on average 25% in the United States. Beyond that, for purposes of these impairment test not that we necessarily think that that's going to happen, but we try to stress them as hard as we think is practical. Beyond that, we look at specific markets and we have assumed as much as a 40% decline in real state prices and that's in the especially overheated markets in the coasts, places like Nevada, places... certain parts of Florida and so on. So even with those extreme scenarios, we've had a write-down very few of these securities. Let me now switch to home loans; our home loans right now, we're in about $36 billion. We've mentioned to you in the past that we have been continuing to drop the loan to value ratio of these loans that we are putting on our books. Most of what we are doing today is serving a 50% range loan to value and that's based upon our values not necessarily based upon what someone's paying for the properties, we underwrite these properties one-by-one ourselves in our real estate department. And you may recall, we have 150 people in MetLife's real state department, who create these home loans and other kinds of loans like agricultural lending and so on. So we've moved down, actually 150 is the just real estate another 100 people in agricultural lending. We've moved down the loan to value over time and we pretty much have stayed at this very low loan to value ratio in the current marketplace. I will tell you, it is one area both agriculture lending and home loan commercial real estate that we view as an opportunity today because the CNBS market really has frozen up and some very attractive properties are coming up for refinancing or in some cases sales, not a lot of sales going on. And we are able to underwrite these loans on a basis very conservative and make very low loan to value mortgages that we create and at very, very attractive spreads, spreads we haven't seen in many years. So we actually look at this is as a real opportunity for us and this point I believe our delinquencies are something like $3 million in our entire portfolio of $36 billion, so it's virtually non-existent. I think then you asked about CNBS, let me kind of flip a few pages here to pull that up. So our CNBS portfolio is nearly 90% AAA rated and 74% of 2005 and the earlier vintages when the underwriting was much more stringent than we saw in the 2006 and beyond period. Our unrealized loss in that portfolio is $800 million, but again as we stress that those securities in our models we think we'll see very few impairments even with an expectation that the market will drop here in terms of pricing the commercial real estate market. We do not think that commercial real estate market will drop as drastically as the residential market for a number of reasons. And I will just summarize it quickly which is the over building we saw in some earlier real estate recessions especially early 1990s did not occur this time around. And the supply demand balance is far more attractive right now than it was back in some earlier real estate recessions. So, we are still modeling out 10% or 15% further declines in valuation there's been about 10% dip in prices in that market already. So, basically may be a 25% peak to trough kind of dip is what we are modeling out. And based upon that, we really think the portfolio is in very good shape. Let's just go onto credit cards and auto; credit cards about $6 billion in total, auto about by $1.5 billion. We have... as these securities would have been rolled off our books in terms of maturing or in some cases in sales, the average rating on these securities has gone up for us now. It's largely... it's a way toward a AAA rated portfolio these securities. And again I would say to you that, this is an area where we are actually a buyer and while buying is the highest tranches, first pay tranches of AAA rated credit card with the strongest trust, the banks that they have these, and kind of where it's all and also the expertise to manage these trusts, because there is some flux that goes on these trusts in terms of how they can flex these credit card security they are able to have people cut off to some degree in terms of the lending limits, the borrowing limits, they can adjust interest rate and so on. So we are sort of following the strongest players in the market place, we are buying the highest quality tranches, we are seeing historically high spreads, we stress this again the AAA rated trans area at extreme levels beyond anything that people are projecting, and still we can find a realistic scenario that says they won't be money good and given the kinds of spreads we're seeing for AAA rated assets, which is a hard place for live as an insurance company, right now, it's actually delivering very, very strong margins for us against our traditional business, we are buying these securities. And as you might guess, the rating agencies are looking hard at these newly created structures, they are planning to do some very tough tests, the underwriting has got much better by the creator of these securities and we really think this is a good opportunity for us to buy securities in these areas. So basically, we are putting our new money is AAA rated credit cards, selectively in autos depends upon which auto companies and so on, low loan to value Ag loans and commercial real estate loans and those are sort of the main areas we will invest our money today.
Tisha Jackson: Great. Thank you. And if I could just follow-up really quick, do you have any kind of CDO, CLO exposure? And then on... when, I'd like to you, your expertise in terms of when we're questioning others on kind of their home, commercial home loans, how are you calculating the loan to value and what do you think are the questions we should be asking of others in terms of to figure out whether they're being just as disciplined?
Steven A. Kandarian: Yes,I am told there is queue, so I may have to go quickly, let me just kind of hit at the higher level. The CDOs, our CDOs are about $1.4 billion. Of that, only $23 million is subprime, so some of the things you are reading about in the papers in terms of people selling those. CDO exposures at $0.22 from a $1, they are very different kind of securities than we hold. Ours are largely CLOs, only 2% below investment grade, well of our half is, over 80% is AA, AAA, again we stress our structures and they all come out very well in terms of being able to pay off over the course of the length of the security. So we have a very different kind of CDO portfolio, mostly CLOs in very high quality. So from the things you are reading about, are very different kinds of securities than what we hold. With that, I think I'd turn it over back to the operator.
Tisha Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question today comes from the Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Thomas Gallagher: Thanks. Just a few quick ones for Steve also. First is, can you talk a little bit about private equity and do you still think sort of the worst case scenario for returns in the current environment is low single-digit returns or is it possibly going to go negative in particular when Bill had mentioned 3Q outlook being softer is that low returns or is that potentially going negative. And then just a follow up on Tisha's question, on just overall, I guess you're seeing very low, for example, commercial mortgage loans and corporate bonds. Are there any signs of trouble on the horizon like are your watch list loans growing or anything like that? Thanks.
Steven A. Kandarian: Okay. Private equity returns, those are two buckets there; one is traditional LBO funds and the other funds that are untraditional LBO funds like mez funds and so on. The LBO funds actually did go negative this quarter because of I think you may have heard from Bill, we had earlier about one large transaction that was an equity that was publicly traded on a stub basis in a Chinese bank. And so that drove the numbers negative for the quarter. We don't anticipate that for the rest of the year because that one kind of outlier instance. But we do believe that those returns will be pretty low for the rest of the year, those kinds of returns correlate strongly with the subordinate debt market as you might guess, LBO players start selling properties to each other or to the marketplace based upon financing availability to each other and in the high yield area that's still pretty tough market right now in terms of being able to acquire there, much less that what price. So we anticipate third and fourth quarter will be weak on those LBO returns. However, as you know, variable income has a number of components and some others are balancing off and as we've mentioned to you, the securities lending portfolio correlates closely in terms of how large the profits are to the shape of the yield curve. And right now, we have very low short-term interest rates and relatively high or higher at least longer term interest rates in the near term interest rates. So the shape of that curve does have the second lending businesses offset to some degree what's going on in the private equity portfolio. Let me go onto commercial loans next. The delinquencies are very, very small, we are not really seeing a very much of an uptick in terms of problem loans. We did have a few things out in the Midwest that concerned us, we sold those loans. Last quarter we took them to income statement, there were some losses there, we had some reserves that we adjusted. So the parts of the portfolio that most concerned us have been dealt with to date. And as of now, I don't really see much that would concern me in terms of that portfolio overall. I would say the corporate bond portfolio is a different story and we position that by selling off of a lot of things that are more cyclical in the economy, and increased our exposure to things that do well in a downturn. Certain pharmaceuticals for example, food certain other parts of the economy that can be pretty steady in the recession, so we position the portfolios in that way, but the number of dollars we have in corporate credit is so large that if this economic situation turns into a full blown recession, then obviously we'll have some defaults in those companies over time. And that's just the way it works in our cycles from time-to-time. So I think we are as well positioned as we can reasonably be at this point in time for we are anticipating coming down the pipe. But having said that, the portfolio is I can sit here and tell you we are not going have defaults in corporate bonds where those numbers are in excess of $100 billion on our books.
Thomas Gallagher: Okay, thanks.
Robert C. Henrikson: I think that concludes our questions today, I think we are out of time and other people have to get on the call. So thank you very much.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MetLife Incorporated First Quarter Earnings Release. [Operator Instructions].As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements related to trends in the company’s operations and financial results, the markets for its products and the future development of its business. MetLife’s actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described in MetLife Inc.’s filings with the SEC, including its S-1 and S-3 registration statements. MetLife Incorporated specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Conor Murphy, Head of Investor Relations.
Conor Murphy - Head of Investor Relations: Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife’s first quarter 2008 earnings call. We are delighted to be here this morning to talk about our results for the quarter. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplement, both of which are available on our website at MetLife.com, on our investor relations page. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment-related gains and losses which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments, we will take your questions. Here with us today to participate in the discussion are Bill Mullaney, President of Institutional; Lisa Weber, President of Individual Business; Bill Toppeta, President of International, and Bill Moore, President of Auto and Home. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rob.
C. Robert Henrikson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Conor, and good morning, everyone. MetLife had a strong first quarter. We grew our top line results by 11.5% to reach a record of $9.4 billion in premiums, fees and other revenues. We increased operating earnings per share by almost 8% and grew our book value despite the challenges posed by the credit and equity markets. The fundamentals of our business are strong and I want to share a few specific examples with you. With our leading position in the group marketplace, Institutional Business continues to demonstrate its ability to generate outstanding results. Across the board, Institutional performed extremely well as it benefited from solid underwriting, strong investment spreads and continued expense discipline. Operating earnings grew 23% over the prior year period with each segment growing at a double-digit rate. Institutional’s operating ROE was an impressive 22.5% for the quarter. In terms of our overall group insurance, I’m pleased with the 2008 sales season so far. In general, quote volumes are consistent with, or up from 2007 levels. We have also been through the January 1 renewal season and are seeing persistency that is well inline with our expectations. In retirement and savings, we won closeout cases both in the US and the UK. I’m also particularly pleased with non-medical health where revenue grew 13%, and operating earnings increased 49% year-over-year. This double-digit growth was driven by very strong results in disability and dental. Our organic growth in dental was complemented by our recent acquisition of SafeGuard, which, as I mentioned last quarter, gives MetLife dental HMO capabilities rounding out our offerings in several key growing local markets. Total earnings for Individual Business were relatively flat year-over-year impacted by lower market performance and an increase in mortality, invariable and universal life. Despite the turbulence in the economy, however, Individual Business generated some key positive results during the quarter. We increased life insurance sales by a solid 9% year-over-year. In addition, we collected $3.2 billion in variable annuity deposits and net flows remain positive. We continue to benefit from having the broadness distribution in the industry, and we remain well positioned to continue to capture the growing retirement opportunities in the US. As you know, we are consistently investing in our operations outside of the United States to ensure that international business will continue to be strong and a growing contributor to MetLife. International’s financial results continue to be impressive. Premiums, fees and other revenues grew 25% over the prior year period to reach $1.2 billion, and our operating earnings grew 10%. In particular, business in Latin America was very strong this quarter. In Mexico, where we are the market leader, our topline grew by 14%. We also completed our acquisition of a AFORE Actinver, during the quarter. This transaction expands our distribution in Mexico and strengthens our position in the pension business. Turning to Asia, the volatile equity markets in Japan had a negative impact on sales, which were down 17% in the quarter. However, sales were up in the rest of the region, including South Korea, which grew by 82% due to the significant increase in agents. Steve Kandarian will provide you with an update on our investments in a moment. Briefly I’m pleased with the overall performance of the portfolio. As we expected, we saw a marginally higher level of credit losses due to the current credit environment. In addition, we also recognized losses on our foreign currency and interest rate hedges. However, let me remind you that we use hedges to reduce risks, and those losses are positively offset by corresponding gains that are recorded elsewhere in the financial statements. Let me assure you that strategically the portfolio is well positioned to support MetLife’s businesses now and in the long run. Last month MetLife celebrated its 140th year in business, and today our fundamentals continue to be strong. While the current economic environment may remain volatile, we will continue to benefit from having a diverse mix of related businesses. Looking ahead, they will continue to serve us well as we remain disciplined, focused on the bottomline and committed to providing value for our shareholders. And with that, I will turn it over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: Thanks, Rob. I would like to provide you with an update on our portfolio and its performance of the last quarter. During this period of strong headwinds, our portfolio performed well, and we remain comfortable with the overall strength and diversification of our assets. While recent market volatility impacts the current value of our holdings, it also presents us opportunities to purchase high quality assets at very attractive spreads. First, let me start with a comment on variable income. Pre-tax variable income was approximately $20 million higher than planned for Q1. We experienced higher corporate joint venture and securities lending income versus planned. While corporate joint ventures continued to perform well, we expect these returns to moderate during the remainder of the year due to tighter credit conditions, volatile equity markets and general economic conditions. Securities lending income was also strong due to the steepening at the front end of the yield curve and higher spreads in the reinvestment portfolio. We anticipate that securities lending will outperform plan for the remainder of the year. On the negative side, hedge fund returns were below plan, reflecting weak performance for the sector generally. Now, let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses, as noted on page 34 of the QFS, were $532 million, in line with the previous three quarters. Of this amount, only $45 million were credit-related sales. Write-downs were relatively modest $186 million. Of this amount, $80 million was related to financial institutions and $24 million to structured finance CDOs. In addition, there were $43 million of real estate reserve adjustments due to mortgage sales as we continually review and upgrade our portfolio. The remaining $39 million of write-downs were connected to a variety of fixed maturity and equity securities. When added together, total credit-related losses from sales and write-downs were $231 million before tax or $150 million after-tax. This represents less than 7 basis points on our overall portfolio and is in line with our expectations given current market conditions. Losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting increased this quarter to $580 million. Virtually all of our derivatives are used for hedging purposes. The increase in losses on derivatives in Q1 is primarily attributable to our foreign currency and interest rate hedges. As you know, MetLife invests in a diversified global portfolio. When we purchased assets denominated in a currency, a foreign currency, for the US general account, we generally use foreign currency derivatives to swap the cash flows into US dollars. As the dollar weakened during the quarter, the decline in the value of these derivatives was reflected on our income statement, while the increase in the value of the hedge assets was reflected on our balance sheet. In addition, we used a variety of interest rate hedges, including interest rate swaps, floors and caps to better match assets and liabilities and protect against interest rate changes. One of the hedges we employ is the interest rate swap in which we pay a fixed interest rate and receive a floating interest rate. These swaps convert fixed-rate assets into floating-rate assets to better match the cash flows of our floating-rate liabilities. The significant drop in short-term rates during Q1 resulted in a net decline in the value of these interest rate swaps. Just as with our foreign currency hedges, these swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting, and the decline in the value of the derivatives is reflected in our income statement, while the increase in the value of the hedged assets is reflected on our balance sheet. Unrealized losses, which appear on page 36 of the QFS, also increased in the quarter due to spread widening. For example, spreads in the investment grade corporate bond market have widened about 80 basis points during the quarter. In addition, spreads in other asset classes such as structured finance widened even more dramatically, often beyond what the underlying fundamentals would suggest. While this caused our unrealized loss position to increase on current holdings, it also presents opportunities to purchase assets we believe are relatively safe, even during an economic downturn and at attractive spreads. Finally, I would like to briefly discuss our commercial mortgage holdings. We owned approximately $18.6 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities at March 31. Based upon our fundamental underwriting analysis, our strategy has been to focus on AAA rated securities from the 2005 and earlier vintages. Overall 95% of our CMBS portfolio is rated AA or AAA, and approximately 75% of our holdings are from the 2005 and earlier vintages, which benefit from better underwriting and price appreciation. We remain comfortable with the quality of these holdings. In addition to CMBS, we also hold approximately $36 billion of commercial mortgage whole loans originated by MetLife’s real estate department. We view this origination capability as a competitive advantage for us. The average loan to value of this portfolio is approximately 55%, and only 6% of the portfolio has a loan to value of 75% or greater. There continues to be limited new issuance in the CMBS market. This is providing us with attractive opportunities to make low leverage, high spread loans on A properties and A markets. So, in summary, our risk management efforts and fundamental analysis approach have positioned us well for the current economic environment. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. MetLife reported $1.52 of operating earnings per share for the first quarter, which was a 7.8% increase over the first quarter of last year. This morning I will walk you through our financial results and point out some highlights, as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter. We had top line revenues, which we define as premiums, fees and other income of $9.4 billion, a record. This represents an increase of 11.5% over the first quarter of 2007. Institutional had a strong quarter with revenue growth of 13.7% year-over-year. All three product areas in Institutional, group life, non-medical health, and retirement and savings, had excellent growth. International’s revenues grew by 24.6% over the year ago period. Foreign exchange rates positively affected revenue growth by approximately 6 points. Excluding the currency impact, International revenues grew by about 19% over the year ago period, led by stronger annuity sales in Chile. Turning to our operating margins, let’s start with our underwriting results. Underwriting experience was somewhat mixed this quarter. We had some very good results and also some weaker areas among our various product lines. In Institutional, group life mortality of 93.8% was within our guidance range of 91% to 95%. In non-medical health and other, group disabilities morbidity ratio improved to 80.6% for the quarter, well below our target range of 89% to 94%. This strong result was not due to an unusual reserve release, but instead was primarily caused by favorable disability recoveries. We had much higher than normal mortality experience in both our reinsurance business, which is RGA, and in Individual. Individual’s mortality ratio of 93.4% was driven mainly by higher frequency in older blocks as opposed to highlight cases. Turning to Auto and Home, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 90.8%. Included in this result is a prior accident year reserve release of $23 million after-tax compared to a $30 million after-tax release in the prior year period. Catastrophe losses for the quarter were $5 million after-tax higher than planned. Moving to investment spreads. In general investment spreads were good this quarter. Variable investment income was approximately $13 million after DAC tax, and other offsets or $0.02 per share higher than our baseline plan. But the performance of certain variable income asset classes was mixed, as Steve just explained. Obviously, the market environment continues to be volatile, but we feel that our variable investment income plan is still appropriate. The steep drop in short-term interest rates caused our investment margins in group life and retirement and savings to be strong, and you can see that in the reported spreads. However, the weak equity market significantly affected the profitability of our variable annuity business. In our plan, we assume that equity markets increased by 5% during the year. In the first quarter, the S&P 500 declined by about 10%, which is a swing of 15 points versus plan. Our rule of thumb is that each 1% move in the S&P 500 is worth $0.01 a share over the course of a year. We estimate that the decline in the equity markets cost us $0.06 per share versus plan this quarter. And unless equity markets improve, there will be a continuing drag on earnings versus plan for the remainder of the year. But, of course, the market is up so far this quarter. Moving to expenses, our overall expense levels came down as we anticipated. If you recall, we projected an expense ratio of 28% to 29% in 2008. Our expense ratio in the first quarter was 28.1%, which was very good. Turning to our bottom-line results, we earned $1.1 billion in operating income or $1.52 per share, representing a 7.8% increase in operating EPS over the first quarter of last year. With regard to investment gains and losses, in the first quarter, we had net realized investment losses of $560 million after-tax. Steve just gave a good explanation of what is in that number. The only thing I would like to add is that, included in the net realized loss amount was the January 1, 2008 impact of adopting FAS 157, which was $19 million net of income tax. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings are approximately $600 million this quarter, a timing difference relating to the tax deductibility of policyholder dividends, reduced statutory operating income by approximately $110 million this quarter. Total statutory capital at March 31, is approximately $20.9 billion. In the first quarter, MetLife repurchased approximately 20.4 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.25 billion, under both accelerated share repurchase agreements and open market purchases. At March 31, 2008, MetLife had $260.7 million remaining on its existing share repurchase authorization, but in April of 2008, an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization was approved by the Board. So in summary, this was a solid quarter and obviously, a good start for MetLife in 2008. And with that, let me turn it back over to the operator, so we can take your questions. Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Jimmy Bhullar. One moment please.
Jamminder Bhullar - J.P. Morgan Securities: Alright, thank you. I have a couple of questions. The first one is on your outlook for variable investment income. You mentioned you feel okay for the rest of the year. But if you can talk about dynamics in securities lending, the margins picking up, is that enough to offset a potential for no improvement in private equity for the rest of the year? And then the second question that I have is on your retirement and savings business. On spreads they were relatively good this quarter despite the fact that variable investment income was slightly short of plan in that segment. And most of that was driven by I think a 45 basis point sequential decline in crediting rates. I’m assuming that would sustain if interest rates remain where they are right now, but if you could talk about that?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: Jimmy, I will take the variable income question, Steve here.
Jamminder Bhullar - J.P. Morgan Securities: Hi.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: Hi. Our view is that our guidance still is pretty good guidance going forward. Obviously it’s hard to predict variable income, that’s why we call it variable. But, as we look at the different components, securities lending appears to have some pretty good wind to us back for the rest of the year. Just given the shape of the yield curve, which was actually hurting us last year, now it’s really turned around and is helping us. Our liability costs have gone way down in that program. Given high spreads, reinvestment rates are attractive compared to liability costs for us. So we think that’s going to perform well for the remaining three quarters of the year. We’ve been talking about CJV income being extremely high in the past and questioning whether that would continue. We had a pretty good quarter here still in Q1 of ‘08, but we do have some visibility in terms of how these markets work. And we think that and remainder of the year will probably be a lot tougher for CJV income. A lot of what they do in terms of realizing gains is recapping deals, which right now is pretty hard to do in this marketplace with the credit problems. Selling companies to others who are leveraging up and that’s hard to do as well. So I think that see CJV income is likely to tail off here for a period of time, and we think the offset from sec lending will pretty much neutralize that.
William J. Mullaney - President, Institutional Business: Jimmy, its Bill Mullaney. With regard to your question on spreads, you recall at investor day for RNS, we said that we have spreads between 115 and 130 bps. This quarter we came in at 151. My expectation for the balance of the year is that, we should be coming in somewhere between 130 and 150 basis points. So I would say we’re more sustainable in terms of where our spreads are than what we had originally said we would be at investor day.
Jamminder Bhullar - J.P. Morgan Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Darin Arita. Please go ahead.
Darin Arita - Deutsche Bank North America: Hi, good morning. A question again on the securities lending income, to what extent would you say this is the normal level of income you would expect to earn given an upward sloping yield curve at the short end? And also, are you buying hedges to protect this income should the yield curve flatten?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: It’s hard to say what’s kind of normal in sec lending because, there are different components to how you make money. The positive right now is not just the upwards sloping curve but also the spread levels, which are very high. You’re seeing those spread levels impact other things and negatively to us, but at least in the reported balance sheet basis, we talked about that, but certainly providing us good opportunities to buy safe assets at very attractive spreads. So as long as those spread remain very wide, we’re going to have sec lending. But I would say that it’s hard to know what happens to spreads over the course of the year. Overall, we think the program is going to be attractive in terms of income for the remainder of the year. We do put on hedges. We pretty much run the program with trying to cut off, if you will, some of the downside risk to the program. When you do that, you do lop off some of the upside gain during certain periods. So yes, we do have hedges on. They remain in place. We have caps. We have floors. We have interest rate swaps. We’ve reduced the amount of interest rate swaps for strategic reasons, just given what our view is of rates right now. But we still have swaps in place. So the program is hedged. It runs kind of, if you will, within some band. There is variability within that band, but we do lop off the bottoms and the tops with our hedges.
Darin Arita - Deutsche Bank North America: And how far out is it hedged?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: You’re asking how far out the hedges go?
Darin Arita - Deutsche Bank North America: Yes.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: There are a variety of hedges that go up through early 2010 I believe, but it depends on the specific kinds of hedges we’re talking about. There are some caps, floors and swaps, and it is not one for each of those three categories. There is a whole series of these hedges that we put in place over a period of time. So they kind of roll off and we put more on as time goes on. So we put hedges on in Q1, for example that didn’t exist when we last talked to you. And some of the others have rolled off or been sold. It is kind of an ongoing dynamic process that we engaged in with our hedges.
Darin Arita - Deutsche Bank North America: All right. Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Tammy Kravec - Banc of America. Please go ahead.
Tamara Kravec - Banc of America Securities: Thank you, good morning. A couple of questions, first, on your hedging program, obviously you had a pretty big test in the first quarter with the equity market decline. Can you talk about how you feel your program is performing against your guaranteed liability? And my second question is on Japan and what you’re seeing there in terms of competition. Hartford made some commentary about the competitive environment being pretty intense. I’m also curious whether you think FIE has already played through there or whether you would expect some more effects from that? Thanks.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Tamara it’s, Bill. I’ll start with the variable annuity hedging program. It worked well again this quarter. And we obviously listen to what our peers say, and some of them seem to be having some difficulty. We think our program works well, we think we do it right. We spend a lot of money investing in the technology to make sure we do it right. So if that continues to work well even and you are right. I think this quarter was a very good challenge, and it has continued to perform.
Tamara Kravec - Banc of America Securities: Are you fully hedged with this?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That’s always a difficult question to answer given the nature of some of the writers we write. We do hedge all three groups, and we are hedged given sort of the accounting that we have on the way our writers work. We make sure we are hedged to offset that as best we can, so we are as fully hedged as we think we really can be.
William J. Toppeta - President, International: Tamara, hi, it’s Bill Toppeta.
Tamara Kravec - Banc of America Securities: Hi, Bill.
William J. Toppeta - President, International: Hi, how are you? On the Japan question, I would say, of course, the Japanese annuity individual annuity market is a competitive market, there is no question about that. Having said that, I think that we are doing quite well in the competitive environment. I have some preliminary results on the bank channel, which tell me that for the first quarter we were second in variable annuity sales to Tokyo Marine and second in fixed annuity sales to ALICO. So even though the market is down certainly in the variable area, we’re down consistent with the market, not more than that, but consistent with the market. So it is a challenging market, but I think that part of that, of course, is related to the performance of the equity markets in the country. As far as FIEL is concerned, I would say the effects are wearing off. I think things have gotten considerably better in this quarter, and I would expect that as we go through the remainder of the year, those effects will pretty well be a non-factor as far as we are concerned. Is that okay?
Tamara Kravec - Banc of America Securities: That’s great, thank you. And I also wanted to ask about personal Auto and Home, and just your general commentary on pricing and loss cost trends and what you’re seeing in frequency and severity in that business?
William D. Moore - President, Auto & Home: This is Bill Moore, Tamara.
Tamara Kravec - Banc of America Securities: Hi.
William D. Moore - President, Auto & Home: Yeah. I think clearly, and I will talk about overall pricing now, we feel pretty strongly we are closer to the end of the soft market cycle than we are the beginning. And one of the reasons for that is that, as you look at some of the margins of the companies and where they are in terms of their combined ratio, we’re starting to see rate increase activity more than we are decreases. Even for us at MetLife Auto and Home, about 70% of our rate activity in the first quarter was for rate increases versus a significantly more reduced number last year. In terms of the pricing cycle, the loss cost, our expectation in loss cost will remain in the low single-digits. That is what we’re seeing for us, and that’s just pure frequency and severities. And we’re offsetting that, as you know, if you followed our Investor Day guidance, we are mitigating that because of some initiatives we put in place to reduce our expenses.
Tamara Kravec - Banc of America Securities: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of Colin Devine with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Good morning. I am going to spare, Steve, the questions, and I think I will focus on some of the others. First, for Lisa, I don’t think there is any way to sugarcoat the variable annuity sales being a disappointment this quarter. They are certainly much weaker than several of your leading competitors. What happened there? Is it one quarter is not a trend? Are there some new features coming out to sort of get these things reinvigorated, maybe tell us what was behind the disappointment? On the Institutional side, I was wondering if you have seen any pickup in quoting activity on pension closeouts since so many large corporate plans froze at the end of last year, and then finally, for Bill, you just made a comment on the hedge program that the accounting is hedged. And I just wondered if we might clarify that. Is your hedge program hedging the economics of these living benefits, or is it instead just hedging the GAAP results?
Lisa M. Weber - President, Individual Business: Okay. Why don’t I start with the variable annuity sales? Our variable annuity sales, compared to the industry were actually really very credible. Our deposits were down 4% year-over-year, and if you look at VARD’s preliminary results, the industry is down about 10% year-over-year. So we compared really pretty favorably. We do see that our variable annuity sales are tied to what’s going on in the equity markets, and that’s particularly true in the third-party channel where there has also been a lot of change, particularly in the wirehouses. Having said that, we are retaining the business that we have on the book, and we also -- if you saw the press release, we also announced some enhancements and changes to our variable annuity product line just this past Monday. And there is a lot of excitement in the marketplace around that, we can tell that by the number of requests that we’re getting for kits. And, of course, as with any change it takes awhile to get those changes baked in, but we are satisfied with our quarter, and we are optimistic going forward given some calming in the market and some of the new features and products that we have.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Are those features approved in New York?
Lisa M. Weber - President, Individual Business: We have -- our new LWG is approved in 42 states. It is not approved in New York yet. We also have changes to our investment portfolio where we have introduced American Funds, which is going over really well, Oppenheimer Funds as well and some changes to our GMIB Plus.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Thanks, Lisa.
William J. Mullaney - President, Institutional Business: Colin its Bill Mullaney. Let me just spend a minute talking about what’s going on in the pension closeout market. I think that you saw from our results in our RNS this quarter that our revenues were up 59%. That was driven primarily by closeout sales in the first quarter. We did over $250 million of closeouts, which were reflected in that number. In terms of the overall market, you’re right that there were more plans that froze as of the end of the year. One of the things that we’re watching closely, though, is the overall funding status of those plans. Equity markets have been down fairly significantly. And so one of the things that needs to be in place in order to be able to engage in a pension closeout is the planning that needs to be funded completely or the employer needs to be able to put up some additional money to be able to make the closeout work. So that’s something that we’re watching. I would say that our pipeline for closeout activity continues to be good. We talked at Investor Day about having $1 billion in our plan in terms of pension closeouts, so and right now we are optimistic that we’re going to be able to achieve that objective.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Thanks.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. And finally, on our variable annuity hedging program, we have a variety of writers for our variable annuity. Sometimes it’s more of a withdrawal benefit, sometimes it’s a GMIB or interest rate benefit. And interestingly or not interestingly, the accounting of those is different. And so when a GMIB liability is put on and we have guarantees, the accounting liability we would say does not accurately reflect the overall economic liability. So we’re left with a dilemma. Do we hedge to the accounting, or do we hedge to the economic, or do we try to somehow bridge the gap? And the reality is we try to bridge the gap because if we … the problem is, of course, if we actually hedge to the economic, that would create an incredible amount of volatility in our reported GAAP statement. So we have a baseline hedging program which hedges the accounting liability on GMIB, which is our biggest writer. But we also buy a lot of long-dated puts opportunistically to try to get to the economic liability as well. And so that is sort of … that is how we manage it, Colin if you will. That’s why I always hesitate to say, well, you are fully economically hedged. Well, not entirely on GMIB, we are not.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Okay. Then, Bill, maybe the real question is then not how the accounting optics of the hedge program performed during the quarter, but really how did the economics perform?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, we actually think they perform fine. And when we look at where our liability account balances are and in terms of where … and in terms of our separate accounts guarantee exposure, we think it is very manageable. The long-dated puts we have in place are helping us a lot here.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Okay.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So, now the accounting works, yes, but the long-dated puts work as well. I’m sorry, so Toppeta is going to add something here.
William J. Toppeta - President, International: I’m sorry; I’m trying to whisper something to Bill. As part of our overall risk management on the variable annuity writers, we also engage in reinsurance. And we have a substantial amount of reinsurance on some of our income benefit writers, as well as the riskier elements of our guaranteed minimum debt benefits, particularly the ones that have ratchet features in them.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right. What we have done is we have executed not with traditional reinsurers but with really investment banks. We have introduced reinsurance agreements, which also sort of bridged this problem between accounting and economic liability, if you will and so through reinsurance arrangements.
Colin Devine - Citigroup: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a question then from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley: All right. Thank you, good morning. First, on your investment portfolio, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the gross unrealized losses rose substantially to $8.8 billion. Now, I understand most of that was spread widening in high-quality investment, but it also seems like you are now sitting on $2.7 billion of losses that are 20% or more below water. I was hoping you could review with us your impairment policies? Do you use a bright line test, and if so, if these bonds remain under water over the next quarter, will you be forced to take some impairments?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: Nigel, it’s Steve. Yes, the bucket for 20% or more less than six months is now about $2.6 billion of those bonds. A lot of it obviously is based upon or virtually all of it is based upon the spread widening. Interest rates have come down, which increased the value of the bonds, while the spreads have widened more than interest rates have come down. Now we have seen since quarter-end a reversal to some degree of those spreads and interest rates both. So the question will be, does this remain in place for six months, first of all? This is very broad widening of spreads you have seen across the entire market. And my guess is you will see some moderation in that spread widening, and things will follow that bucket. I mean we looked at parts of that bucket already to see where things moved in one month, and about 20% of at least of the riskier assets have fallen out of that bucket. Now, who knows what happens over the next five or six months. These securities that show up for March 31, 2008 really got there in the month of March. So, basically the first month out of the six-month, general rule of thumb that people use in terms of looking at things like impairments. And I probably should talk a little bit about that as well, the impairing policy. The basic rule of thumb that we use is, especially for fixed-income securities, is to look at what has been 20% underwater for six months. We look at whether we intend and have the ability to hold those securities to recovery. And we look at the contractual cash flows and say, are we still receiving all of our contractual cash flows; are we likely to continue receiving all those contractual cash flows based upon the structures we buy in the mortgage-backed security world or the bonds we buy in the corporate bond world? Obviously we look at the fundamentals. Is the company able to pay us back? What is their status and so on? So a lot of what you see in some of these buckets are securities that in many cases are issued by companies with A, AA ratings, and we have seen some real spread widening in certain categories of the marketplace. So, our gut is that these are money goods securities in the vast majority of cases, but we will reassess things as time goes on and as new information is provided to us. And we will look at things six months out and take a hard look at those impairments. Now, let me just add one more thing because I think it’s important for people to understand. If we were to go and be, let say, ultraconservative and start writing things off that we really thought were money goods securities that would then reverse back into our income in future months and years. And one could look at that and say, well is that really a fair representation of what the true accounting should be and take a one-time hit on securities you think really are money good, and there’s no reason to really write down and then take it back into income overtime. So it is a balancing act. We don’t want to impair securities that we really think are money good. On the other hand, we don’t wait six months if we think a security really is not going to be money good. Some of the impairments we talked about today in our remarks were not after six months or after one month when we have got some news that suggested to us that we should take a hard look at it, and we did impair some securities very quickly.
Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. And then, second question on capital. It seems like you still have got significant excess capital and holding company liquidity. At Investor Day, you commented that that $750 million of buyback beyond that necessary to offset the equity units is what you were targeting. What you did in the quarter effectively offset the equity units. So is $750 million still a good estimate for the remainder of the year, or is there a potential for that number to move higher given you haven’t been hit by any of the issues that have impacted many of your peers?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Nigel, yeah, you are right. We did do a lot of buyback activity in the first part of the year, and just sort of coincidentally it is not on purpose. We bought back 20 million shares, and that is roughly the amount of the convert … the shares that will come out of the convert in the third quarter. So yes, you would say, well, you must have 750 to go. And our philosophy is we made a commitment on Investor Day regarding buyback activity, and that is what we are going to honor. And when we get to that point, then we will see. I mean I guess obviously there’s a lot of turmoil out there, and maybe there will be an acquisition we will want to do. We are just going to be flexible. We will see where we are at and then decide what we want to do. And it also is somewhat dependent on the stock price. The reason we bought so much stock back in the first quarter is we were being very opportunistic. The stock spent a lot of time in the ‘50s in the first quarter, and our attitude is that’s a pretty big buying signal. And so we bought back about as aggressively as we possibly could to get it cheap. So, we will just have to see how … I guess my answer is, yes, we do have a lot of dry powder even after this buyback activity, and we will see … we will just have to stay flexible about what we do in the latter part of the year.
Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley: That’s great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Hey, thank you. And we do have question then from the line of Suneet Kamath with, Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company: Thanks. Just two questions, first, on the other temporary impairment, it seems like we are hearing different approaches across companies, and I’m just wondering why that is? Is that company-specific interpretation of GAAP accounting, or is it the auditors? Just any thoughts on that? And then second, in terms of your expense control, obviously you’re at the lower end of the expense ratio target for the year. How should we think about that trending over the balance of the year? Do you expect to pop back up? Are there any investment initiatives that you have in place that maybe were light in the first quarter, or conversely are there additional opportunities to save costs and perhaps drop below that 28%? Thanks.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So, let’s start with the accounting. I’m probably not qualified to answer this question. I don’t know what really our … obviously we let all this into the same earnings calls about what some of our peers are doing. We obviously have a very different approach. I guess my feel … and I don’t think we are inconsistent with where our outside auditors are in terms of what we should be doing regarding OTTI. So I have a hard time explaining kind of what some of our peers’ motivation is. We don’t think that is really appropriate. We think that you do need to exercise. You should not have a bright line test. You need to exercise judgment about whether or not these securities are really money good or not. And because we think that is the fairest representation of what is really going on in the company. So the idea of I will take a capital loss and then it will just accrete it back in the earnings overtime, you know that strikes me as financial engineering, not necessarily good accounting. So I guess -- I mean that is sort of I guess our take. But again, I am sure I am completely unqualified unqualified, somebody will explain to me I’m wrong. But no, that obviously what we think we’re doing is the proper interpretation, and also I think our outside auditors would agree with us. So I do not know if that helps. The second thing about expenses, yeah, it was a good number this quarter. First quarter often is a good number for us for a variety of reasons. I think we’re still basically in my mind on our plan number, which is 28 to 29% is what we said. That’s a substantial drop from last year’s number, which I think ended up at about 30.5. So we have sort of ratcheted down sort of spending levels this year already. Is it impossible that it will move more? Yeah, probably, but that is a decision we will obviously be monitoring over the course of the year. Obviously some of the spending we’re doing we’re trying to build growth for the future, and so that’s a little bit about our philosophy there. So we will clearly, yes, expense levels, we could bring them down further if we thought it was appropriate, but right now I think we’re tracking well on plan.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.: Thanks, maybe just one quick follow-up on the OTTIs. I guess given the current environment, I have been hearing more and seeing more analysis done on book value inclusive of AOCI. I know that you show it both ways. But can you just confirm that the rating agencies when they look at your, say, leverage ratios and those sorts of things, do they use book value including AOCI, or do they exclude it?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: They exclude AOCI. And in terms of calculating leverage ratios. And you are right. I have noticed too this quarter people now are focused on book value with AOCI. The one thing you’ve got to always keep in mind here is, AOCI is a mark-to-market of our assets, or most of our assets of our investment portfolio. It is not marking liabilities. Okay? The liabilities are affected by interest rates just the same way the assets are, okay? And so I still think I would probably exclude all those AOCI in terms of looking at straight book value in terms of what is really going on, because obviously, if you’re only marking one side of the balance sheet, I think you’re getting a little distorted picture, so that’s important why we show it both ways.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.: Thank you.
Operator: Thanks. And we have a question then from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates. Please go ahead.
Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates: Hey, good morning everybody. Just for what is worth, I totally agree on the AOCI comment. Lisa, I wanted to talk about the annuities. Colin touched on that, but what’s your thought here? I mean we have seen the industry is down. There was some thought that maybe various writers would protect that part of the annuity industry from market downturns. I don’t think we have really seen that. Can you kind of comment on that?
Lisa M. Weber - President, Individual Business: Yes. I mean I think that the market downturn -- the resulting impact is a temporary dip. And that’s what we have all seen in the marketplace, and frankly, that’s what we have experienced some of ourselves. Having said that, we really believe that now more than ever is the time when people are looking for guarantees, and they want our guarantees. And so it’s not ever going to be a product or a writer in and of itself that is going to make the difference, but really the whole package. And that’s what we’re seeing. And so yes, while we have some of our new products and features that are coming out, it is the content of what they are that are going to make a difference. And so when you look at features like age banding and American Funds, they give people more confidence. And so I think it is temporary and as I’ve said before, fortunately we fared better than most of the industry this quarter in our variable annuity sales. And it’s the business that we’re keeping that we feel especially good about.
Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates: Okay. Thank you. And can we touch on the adverse mortality in the V WELL? Maybe flesh that out a bit. You said it was older blocks of business, which I think is consistent with what RGA said if I remember correctly, but could you flesh that out? RGA mentioned on its call that they had not seen anything adverse so far during the second quarter. Also, may be if you could just flesh it out maybe there was more in January, and that is what affected it. You did not see it in February or March or maybe vice versa if we can just get some sense.
Lisa M. Weber - President, Individual Business: So let me just start, and then I’m sure that Tim or Bill will pick up. In terms of our adverse mortality, we typically see Q1 as more adverse than any other quarter. And so again, we saw that. And yes, it was especially worse than we are used to. But as I said, always Q1 we have the worst mortality. Having said that, it is older blocks of business, business that has been on our books for quite some time. It’s across the board, so it is not in -- while I think you will it’s not in any one particular channel. So whether it is MetLife or the old GenAm block of business, New England Financial, it is really across the board. It is at all face amounts, so there’s not the older ages that are jumping out. The other comment that I would make is that what is consistent is the mortality those blocks, there was less reinsurance. And so that’s what you are seeing the effect of.
Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates: Okay.
Timothy L. Journy - Vice-President and Controller: This is Tim. I’ll just add one thing, Seven. I think we’ve basically covered all the points. But we do see the first quarter blip as she mentioned. We do see volatility quarter-to-quarter, and we have taken a look at recent history in terms of that volatility, and we’re comfortable that it is still within our expected ranges. And so we really think it is just a first quarter phenomenon that we’re seeing in the industry, as well as the lack of reinsurance on specific policies this quarter which also moves around from quarter-to-quarter and it was also still within our acceptable bands.
Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates: Tim, could you point to any causes of death, flu, maybe something like that?
Timothy L. Journy - Vice-President and Controller: Not specifically, there has been speculation about that. But since it has not been industry-wide phenomenon, but we haven’t seen anything specific yet.
Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thanks. And our next question then comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse - North America: Good morning. First, just to follow-up I guess more philosophical on the AOCI question. Bill, I agree with you in terms of the accounting disconnect between the mark on assets versus liabilities. I think that’s particularly true when it’s due to interest rate swings. Do you think that still applies, though, when we’re in an environment where interest rates decline and your book value still goes down because of widening credit spreads? That’s my first question.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, you’re right. Base interest rates decline, but obviously credit spreads have gone up. And that’s most of the reason why our -- that is what most of the reason why our -- we have had the effect our AOCI has gone negative and stuff like that. I should stop. We should not even go there in terms of accounting discussion, but all of your employers are obviously marking to market more and more of their liabilities, which means they are marking to market their debt. Because our credit spreads and obviously almost every financial institution’s credit spreads have also gapped out. And so people are marking them -- in certain cases people are marking to market their liabilities and, of course, recording big gains. You know, I don’t know. I’m not sure what the answer is to deal with that. I mean obviously that seems like an odd distortion too, where if our credit worthiness seems to improve, therefore, we are going to have a loss on our income statement. So I think it is, without getting too philosophical about AOCI, I guess I sort of feel like, look, you’ll have market volatility. We are obviously having a lot of market volatility right now. I think if you want to get a clearer picture of what is really happening to our book value, I think you have to look beyond that, right? Because spreads will tighten, they have already tightened this quarter, and I think obviously some spreads are really credit spreads are really historically wide numbers, and we know that will tighten in. And so you have to kind of look at it on a normalized basis. So that is a little bit why I would say my advice would be, you got to look beyond the AOCI.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse - North America: Okay. Fair enough. On that comment you made about spreads tightening so far this quarter that was sort of my follow-up. I know part of the sec lending strength has been driven by slope of the curve. Part has been wider credit spreads. Now that it seems like corporate spreads are tightening by the day here so far this quarter, does that potentially start to at least take some of the steam out of the sec lending spreads, or have we gotten wide enough or steep enough on the yield curve side where we still have good momentum?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: Hi, Tom it’s Steve. I think certainly for 2008, which is what I was talking about, we still have a very favorable environment, meaning and we own securities that go out over a year. And some are floating-rate, but some or fixed. And certainly these fixed-rate assets that we purchased over last quarter or two have very attractive spreads. They are locked in now for that period of time. So again for 2008 I feel pretty good about the lucky performance of that portfolio. Overtime obviously those spreads will bounce around and will have an impact, and that is again what we call it variable income. If I can just go back for one second on your AOCI comment, if you look back, for example, back in the first quarter of 2007, we had a very large unrealized gain on our books, which again goes through AOCI. And that in some ways wasn’t real either, and that is why we don’t really focus on that all the time because that was simply spreads coming to historically tight levels. We were not going to sell those securities. They were basically defeasing liabilities. We are going to hold them to maturity in most cases. And the same is in the reverse here. You were seeing some real spread widening. We’re seeing certain sectors like even Alt-A where we hold over $5 billion of Alt-A securities. 84% of what we own is enhanced AAA, super senior AAA. The chances of those things defaulting are so remote, it is minuscule. Yet those things are bouncing around all over the place in terms of the impact on unrealized losses. It’s nearly $700 million of unrealized losses in securities that to bust you would have to go into a worse decline in real estate than the depression. So how valuable is this number? I think it is worth looking at, but I think you have to look through it to understand what is behind it.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse - North America: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question then comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with UBS. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS: Okay. Thanks. Bill, I think in maybe a month or two ago there was some concern that maybe auditors might require that MetLife take a hit on variable investment income if they became aware of losses right away as opposed to the roughly two quarter lag on private equity and other asset classes. In this quarter did you accelerate any charges relative to the lag?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You were breaking up a little bit, Andrew, but I think I got your question, which had to do with the timing of our revenue recognition in the private equity portfolio. Let me just take a step back from this for everybody. If any of you invest in private equity funds and you know you have to file your income taxes late, right, because it takes a while to get your results from the fund, and we have the same problem on a bigger scale. Private equity fund mark-to-markets or returns take awhile. And there are certainly a group of funds, and many of them are international funds we are in, where it takes … we don’t get the fund results until two quarters, effectively two quarters after the period … the time period they are marking. So we have this lag problem. Now some we get faster, but we have sort of made a rule of thumb about we don’t try to cherry-pick which ones we report faster or which ones we delay. So that is why we have this lag problem. Lag problems are bad. Okay? You should try to avoid them as much as possible. But what we’re trying to do now is see if we can get some of our general partners or GPs to try to give us our financial results faster so that we can speed up our reporting of those numbers, and that is really where our focus is. So the answer is no, we didn’t accelerate anything this quarter, but it remains a concern in terms of can we speed up the reporting of these numbers. By the way, I should just clarify here, on about half the private equity portfolio; we have this sort of lag issue. On the other half, we just record the income when it comes into us as cash. So that is sort of a good way to think about it, which is I think as timely as we can make it. So no, we didn’t speed up. We ended up not speeding up any reporting of returns this quarter, and so we do have this lag issue, which sort of means, of course, that is why we’ve continued to have sort of good results even this first quarter a little bit.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS: Got it. And just out of curiosity, it sounds like your OTTI methodology makes a lot of sense. But, let’s say, you were very much by the book more than 20% unrealized loss over six months, more than a 50% unrealized loss over a three-month period. Do you think that your OTTI number would have been materially larger maybe percentage wise? Any thoughts around that?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, I don’t think it would have been materially larger because look at the way to show that is look at the aging schedule in our QFS on page 36, and what you will see is that really until very recently the numbers that we had virtually no securities lower than the 20% mark. Okay. I mean that number was a very modest number two quarters ago. It crept up a little bit last quarter and then obviously got bigger this quarter. So, I think the answer is no. I don’t think it would have been very different this quarter. But if we didn’t … and by the way, I don’t like the expression by the book, if we went by the book. We think we’re going by the book. So if we had a different methodology, if we had a bright line test, which we don’t, no, I do not think the difference this quarter would have been very much different.
Andrew Kligerman - UBS: Excellent, thanks.
Operator: Thank you and we have a question then from the line of Eric Berg with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.
Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers: Thanks very much. Good morning. Bill or Steve, continuing on the issue of other than temporary impairments, consider a case where a bond has been valued in the marketplace or less than its amortized cost, a significant discount, say trading at 60% of cost or 70% of cost, for an extended period. And you decide not to impair the security because in your analyst view it is money good to use your expression. What is typically, if there is a typical case, what is your best sense of what is going on in a situation like that? In other words, how could it be that your guy is saying, you’re going to get paid fully, and millions of investors who didn’t comprise the bond market are saying basically, no, you’re not and you say you are right? Obviously you cannot get into the heads of investors, but as best as you can sort of generalize why is it the case that you are sort of right and the rest of the market is wrong about the value of the bonds?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: Eric, it’s Steve. I think from a financial theory point of view, you make a good point, which is in a perfect market these things would trade reflecting true risk. At the same time, you pick up the papers and you read about investment bank melting down, major money center banks getting multibillion dollar infusions of capital because of problems on their balance sheet. And you are seeing these major financial institutions as well as hedge funds unwinding a tremendous amount of leverage that has built up over the last three or four years. In certain markets, this is resulting in some real supply and demand imbalances, and we believe they are going to be relatively temporary imbalances. And things will go back and trade closer to true risk reward kinds of trade-offs that you are talking about. But in the meantime, you are seeing things that are trading at prices that are hard to justify from a fundamental perspective. And that’s why I made a couple of comments in my prepared remarks about seeing some very attractive opportunities, especially in the AAA segment of various asset classes that we invest in, and what we are buying into some of those asset classes now because we’re seeing these imbalances from these supply and demand problems floating through two spreads that you just cannot make sense of. So to us, that is a buying opportunity, on the one hand. On the other hand, we see things like I talked about, Alt-A, where they are kind of bulletproof structures at the super senior level where you have subordination levels at 12% and historical highs of 1% or 2% losses. And if you stress that to 4% or 5%, you don’t get close to busting the structure at 12%. You’re saying this is people doing great leverage unwind, and there is no one on the buying side. So there’s a few money cash investors out there like insurance companies are coming in and sweeping up some of these assets at attractive spreads, but for a period of time, you are seeing unusually wide spreads. As we mentioned, April has seen some of these spreads come back in. Not as far as they went out, but still come in to some degree. And we think the market eventually will get to a point where the price of risk will be properly priced.
Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers: I had one follow-up question. It will be my final question related to the private equity partnerships. I noticed that in the quarter the yield on the asset class captioned equity securities and other limited partnerships fell by more than half from the December quarter to it looks like about 7% from 16%. So initially looking at these numbers, I had thought that you already were experiencing a sharp, sharp decline in private equity returns. But I just heard Bill say that you had a pretty good quarter still. So maybe you could reconcile sort of what would appear to be a sharp … the difference, a short decline in yields on the one hand with the idea that you had a fairly respectable quarter still in private equity returns. Thank you.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: Yes, we had an unusually strong quarter in Q4 of 2007. It was sort of off the charts. It was like a 40% kind of return. And we’ve been signaling that some of these returns just weren’t going to hold up. So basically what we saw was things kind of falling off here. Bill was mentioning the equity method accounting on private equity, and for the year 2007 we had these unusually high returns. There is a lag effect, and now we’re seeing and the returns go back to much more moderate levels, but still in this case slightly above plan. So what Bill was referring to and I was referring to in my remarks, was that we slightly outperformed our plan for 2008. I should mention that our 2008 plan did take into account our view that this sector would moderate in terms of performance. At the same time, you did not see overall guidance go down for variable income because we thought sec lending would do better, which it has.
Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers: Good. I have some follow-up questions, but I will follow-up with Conor. Thank you very much.
Operator: Great, thank you. And our last question this morning comes from the line of John Hall with Wachovia. Please go ahead.
John Hall - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: Great, thank you very much. I just want to talk briefly about the variable income again, but from the context of the changing mix. From the comments I get the sense is that, over the next year, we’re going to see it coming from different buckets. I’m just wondering how that’s going to affect the different business units? Are there some units that are more heavily invested in certain asset classes and are going to see their earnings as a result go down and others go up, and if you could just address that, and then I have one quick follow-up.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: John, I’ll take that I guess. Yeah. It will change how variable income shows up in our business lines a little bit. But I will be honest, off the top of my head I couldn’t say which ones will go up and down. But I don’t think it is not dramatic.
John Hall - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: Okay.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Let me put it that way. It might swing it 5, 10 million bucks in any given quarter for a given business line, but it won’t be dramatic, but it will move it around a little bit. And then obviously sometimes it moves it around this quarter. For instance, non-medical health, which has a little bit of private equity return, had a relatively poor quarter because they were not in the right funds. Okay. So that already happens a little bit, we get that kind of noise.
John Hall - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: Great. And then just finally, Bill, you reminded us that you’ve got some reinsurance agreements out there on the variable annuities. I was just wondering if you could share the amount that you passed on to reinsurers in the quarter.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, I can’t. I can’t do that off the top of my head. We will have to get back to you on that.
John Hall - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: But is it a material type of number?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, is it material? No, it’s not. The contexts are not necessarily material, but what they are is they are important to variable annuities in terms of the liabilities that we’re pushing off. Stan [ph] will give you a little color here.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah. I mean the two types of variable annuity writers which are not embedded derivatives involve our income benefit writers and our guaranteed minimum debt benefits. We have roughly half of our GMIB in force that is not part of direct hedging program reinsured. And in terms of the GMDB, as I mentioned, it is the riskier one, so it is a smaller percentage, but it is a higher amount and vega risk that is reinsured. And just another point I did not make before, which maybe I will make now, is that when you hear about some of these writer enhancements, some of those are designed so that they are treated from an accounting perspective as embedded derivatives, which gives us the ability to directly hedge them.
John Hall - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thanks. And at this time then I would like to turn the conference back for any closing comments.
Conor Murphy - Head of Investor Relations: Thank you for bearing with us, and we will talk to you next quarter. Thank you.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to MetLife fourth quarter earnings release. For the conference today, all the lines will be in a listen-only mode. However, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results, the markets for its products, and the future development of its business. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described in MetLife Inc.'s filings with the SEC, including its S-1 and S-3 registration statements. MetLife Incorporated specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. With that, I'd like to turn the call now to Mr. Conor Murphy, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Conor Murphy - Head of Investor Relations: Thank you John. Good morning and welcome to MetLife's fourth quarter 2007 earnings call. We're delighted to be here this morning and talk about our results for the quarter. This morning, we'll be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or so-called non-GAAP measures. We've reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplements, both of which are available on our website at metlife.com on our Investor Relations page. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment related... with the net investment related to income losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Just to let you know, we had the typo on page five of the QFS attached to the earnings press release. It had no aggregate effect. It has been corrected and it's the revised QFS that's on our website. Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman, President and CEO, Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer, and Bill Wheeler our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments, we will take your questions. Here with us today to participate in the discussion are Bill Mullaney, President of Institutional, Lisa Weber, President of Individual, Bill Toppeta, President of International, and Bill Moore, President of Auto & Home. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert C. Henrikson - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Conor, and good morning everyone. MetLife had another outstanding quarter. We generated record top-line results across all four of our major business segments. This broad-based growth drove total premiums, fees, and other revenues to $9.1 billion in the quarter. More importantly, we continued to convert that revenue growth into earnings, increasing our fourth quarter operating earnings by 15% year-over-year. Without questioned, MetLife is winning in the marketplace every day and we are delivering shareholder value. I want to share a few specific highlights from the quarter. Our Institutional Business continues to outperform. We grew our operating earnings 20% over the prior-year period and produced an operating ROE of 21.8% in the fourth quarter. I’ve said it before and I'm going to keep saying it, MetLife’s Institutional Business is a unique franchise that stands alone in the industry. And despite the current economic environment, our leadership position is solid. We continue to grow and retain customers; leveraging our expertise in the group benefits business and we continue to enhance our product offerings. Last quarter, for example, we announced a strategic acquisition of SafeGuard Health Enterprises to expand our dental offering. And I'm pleased to report that that transaction closed last Friday. Following on a theme we stated before about being opportunistic relative to acquisitions, SafeGuard gives us expanded capabilities in fast growing markets that we expect to fuel continued growth in our highly profitable dental business. In Individual Business, our focus on the fundamentals is driving our results. Our new product offerings and service enhancements initiatives are working and we're leveraging our distribution strength to grow sales. We grew fourth quarter variable annuity statutory premiums and deposits 13% over the prior-year period. And that growth was consistent both across our agency and independent distribution channels. On the Life side, we increased total Life first year premiums and deposits by an impressive 19% over the prior-year period. This is our best result in nine quarters. We have remained disciplined in our pricing and our underwriting and now the market is coming back to MetLife. We continue to see substantial momentum in our international segment. In the fourth quarter, we achieved record top and bottom line results. Premiums and fees and other revenues grew 14% over the prior-year period and exceeded $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter. Our operating earnings grew 26% on a normalized basis, a significant increase over the prior-year period. MetLife's business in South Korea continues to be a highlight, driven by a combination of new product launches and our productive agency sales force that now numbers more than 4,000 sales professionals. In Mexico, we announced our strategic acquisition of AFORE Actinver. This is another great example of MetLife being opportunistic with regard to acquisitions. The AFORE Actinver expands MetLife’s distribution power and adds more than 1 million customers to our growing pension business in Mexico. Also in the fourth quarter, our Japanese joint venture MSI MetLife was selected by the Japan Post to be the sole provider of GMWB annuity products. This is another great opportunity for MetLife. Turning to our investment portfolio, we again produced very strong results. For the first time our quarterly net investment income exceeded $5 billion. Steve Kandarian will provide a more detailed update on our portfolio in a moment. But, first let me just reiterate a few overarching principles. MetLife is focused on risk management. We conduct our due diligence and underwriting to drive our investment decisions. We start with a liability, a promise to our customers, and then we invest in assets that [inaudible] those liabilities. For all these reasons, MetLife continues to focus on a high quality and well-managed investment portfolio. As I look back on full-year 2007, I'm pleased to report another record year for MetLife. We improved both our top and bottom line results, growing each measure by 7% and 18% respectively. We continue to expand our operating ROE and grow our book value at the same time. We also repurchased $1.7 billion in common stock and increased our annual dividend by 25% and we’re also pleased to have finished the year with Forbes Magazine naming MetLife as the Best Managed Insurance Company for 2008. Looking ahead, I'm confident MetLife is well positioned to achieve further success. We will keep winning in the marketplace and building value for our shareholders. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: Thanks Rob. Given the continued volatility in the financial markets, I wanted to update you on our portfolio and its performance over the quarter. The fourth quarter was a record for MetLife reaching $5 billion of net investment income for the first time. In short, we remain comfortable with the overall strength and diversification of our portfolio. Due to our focus on fundamental analysis, risk management, and proactive portfolio management, MetLife has fared very well in this environment of great volatility. First, let me cover variable income. In this quarter pretax variable income continued to be strong and was approximately $270 million higher than plan. This performance was driven largely by higher corporate joint venture and securities lending income. At Investor Day, we projected that our 2008 average variable income would be $305 million per quarter. This included corporate joint ventures, security lending income, bond and commercial mortgage prepayments, and real estate joint ventures. Beginning in the first quarter, we will move hedge funds into variable income and increase our 2008 average plan variable income per quarter to $350 million. We feel this adjustment is appropriate given the growth of our hedge fund program and the variability of returns. Now let me give you an update on our subprime holdings. We remain comfortable with both the amount and quality of our subprime residential mortgage backed securities. These holdings continue to represent less than 1% of our $345 billion portfolio and were approximately $2.2 billion as of December 31, including our holding through RGA. There were no write-downs and less than $1 million of realized losses on MetLife's subprime holdings during the quarter. The total unrealized loss increased to $222 million at December 31, due to continued spread widening. It is important to remember that these unrealized losses are only recognized if we sell the security or write-down its value. 97% of these holdings are at rated AAA or AA, consistent with last quarter. The 3% of these securities rated A or below are all from early vintages benefiting from stronger underwriting and greater housing value appreciation. Our holdings of CDOs backed by subprime mortgages remained very small and declined to $48 million as of December 31. Virtually all these holdings are rated AAA and AA. The unrealized loss on our remaining subprime CDOs was $15 million at December 31. Our Alt-A RMBS exposure also decreased during the fourth quarter to $6.4 billion. These holdings appear in the residential mortgage backed securities line on page 39 of the QFS. All of these investments are rated AAA and 86% are super senior AAA. These super senior tranches have approximately doubled the credit enhancement of the standard AAA tranche. We have no holdings of Alt-A RMBS backed by second liens or option arms. During the fourth quarter, spreads in our holdings widened significantly less than a Alt-A market overall, reflecting the conservative nature of our portfolio. The unrealized loss on these Alt-A holdings was $142 million at December 31, up from last quarter’s $37 million, again due to spread widening. I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our commercial mortgage holdings. We owned approximately $17.7 billion of commercial mortgage backed securities at December 31. Two-thirds of our holdings are from the 2005 and earlier vintages, which benefit from better underwriting and price appreciation. In response of aggressive underwriting and declining credit enhancements in the market, we limited our purchases in 2006 and 2007 primarily to AAA and AA tranches. Overall, 94% of our CMBS portfolio is rated AAA or AA. As of December 31, our CMBS portfolio had an unrealized gain of approximately $49 million, reflecting its high quality. In addition to CMBS, we also hold approximately $35.5 billion of commercial mortgage whole loans, which we view as a competitive advantage for MetLife, utilizing our network of 11 domestic and international real estate offices. When we first observed signs in 2005 of aggressive lending in this market, we shifted our new production to focus on lower loan-to-value mortgages that provide greater protection from default. The average loan-to-value on our portfolio is now below 60% and less than $2 billion are in the high loan-to-value bucket of 80% or greater. We are maintaining our disciplined underwriting approach in this market and continue to focus on lower risk, high quality mortgages. Now, let me briefly discuss current developments relating to monoline insurers. We hold only $48 million of securities issued by monoline insurers. In addition, approximately $6.7 billion of our holdings are guaranteed by monoline insurers. This includes $2.5 billion of municipal bonds, $2.5 billion of private placements, which are primarily military housing transactions, and $1.7 billion of structured finance securities. When we purchase these types of assets, we underwrite the underlying collateral and do not rely solely on the wrap providers. As a result, we are generally comfortable with owning these assets with or without a guarantee. The average underlying credit quality of these holdings is A, and 95% of holdings are investment grade. Finally, credit related losses in the fourth quarter were relatively modest at $49 million dollars after-tax. This includes six maturity write-downs, a real estate reserve adjustment, and losses on credit related sales. I realize you may have questions regarding these and other topics, which I'll be happy to answer in the Q&A session. With that I'll turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Steven, and good morning everybody. MetLife reported a $1.60 of operating earnings per share for the fourth quarter, an increase of 17.6% over the fourth quarter of 2006. We also earned $6.25 for all of 2007, an increase of 19.7% over 2006. This was another outstanding year with top-line revenues of $34.8 billion, operating earnings of $4.8 billion, net income of $4.2 billion, total assets of nearly $559 billion, and an operating return on equity of 15.2%. Maybe I should just read that sentence again. Okay, I won't. This morning, I'll walk through our financial results and point out some highlights, as well as some unusual items, which occurred in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we had top-line revenues, which we define as premiums, fees, and other income of $9.1 billion, a record. This represents an increase of 5.8% over the fourth quarter of 2006. Many of our businesses turned in a strong performance this quarter. International’s revenues increased by 13.7% over the year-ago period, and that was driven by strong sales throughout the Latin America and Asia-Pacific regions. In Individual Business, annuity revenues increased by 13% this quarter and Institutional's revenue growth was only 3.5% this quarter, which is below its normal growth rate. Strong growth in non-medical health of 11.7% and an increase in Group Life revenue of 5.8% were offset by a decline in retirement and savings revenues. As I've said many times, retirement and savings sales can be lumpy and we did have fewer closeouts in structured settlement sales this quarter in a challenging environment. Turning to our operating margins. Let's start with underwriting results. In general, underwriting results were solid and in line with our expectations. In Institutional, Group Life mortality of 93.2% for the quarter reflect an expected seasonal uptick, but was well within our guidance range of 91% to 95%. Disability's morbidity ratio for the quarter at 90.6% is a significant decline from the prior-year period and is reflective of our continued underwriting discipline. In Individual Business, our mortality ratio of 82.3% for the quarter was within our expected range, but net underwriting results were less favorable than in prior year due to low reinsurance coverage on certain claims, and also a $25 million after-tax increase in our reserve for unreported claims. In addition, there were a number of DAC adjustments in both Institutional and Individual Businesses that came out of our annual review of DAC assumptions and experience. These adjustments are reflected in our DAC balances, which flow through expenses in our income statement. The net result was an after-tax $7 million favorable adjustment in Individual Business and an after-tax $13 million unfavorable adjustment in Institutional. Turning to Auto & Home, the combined ratio, which included... including catastrophes, was 91.1%. Included in these results is a prior accident year reserve release of $25 million after-tax compared to a $52 million after-tax release in the prior-year period. Catastrophe losses were right on plan. As for International, changes in Argentine pension regulations caused us to modify certain liabilities and make tax adjustments. The net effect was an after-tax $105 million increase in earnings. Moving to our investment spreads, this quarter we had high returns primarily from corporate joint ventures and securities lending, which resulted in record variable investment income of $143 million after DAC, tax, and another offsets or $0.19 per share higher than our base line plans Retirement and savings, annuities and corporate and other were the main recipients of this income. We also benefited from significant spread improvements in the quarter in some of our short-term liability products, as liability crediting rates fell quickly with a sharp drop in short-term rates. Moving to expenses. Our overall expense levels were up this quarter, but there are a number of one-time items, which contributed to the increase. In connection with the Argentina pension business, a $128 million pretax liability was accrued to cover an obligation to administer certain accounts. Implementation of SOP 05-1 increased expenses by $11 million pretax in Institutional. In corporate and other, we made a $12 million pretax contribution to the MetLife Foundation. And finally, there were a number of litigation reserves and other non-recurring expenses this quarter, which also increased our overall expense levels. I appreciate that the expense line on our income statement was noisy this quarter, but we are actually very comfortable with the underlying expense activities. At Investor Day in December, we projected that the expense ratio would decline to 28% to 29% in 2008 and we are still comfortable with that projection. Turning to our bottom line results. We earned $1.2 billion in operating income or $1.60 per share and that again is a 17.6% increase in operating EPS over the fourth quarter of last year. Also, in finalizing our tax provision in 2007, we decreased our separate account dividend received deduction estimate. And therefore, it trued up our annual estimated tax expense by $28 million this quarter. Turning to investment gains and losses. In the fourth quarter, we had net realized investment losses of $180 million after-tax, DAC, and other adjustments. As Steve mentioned, our credit related losses for the quarter were $49 million after-tax. The remainder of the net realized investment losses was primarily driven by net derivative losses related to positions that protect economic value, but do not qualify for hedge accounting. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings were approximately $540 million this quarter and $2.9 billion for the full-year. Certain adjustments relating to our closed block securitization reduced operating earnings in the fourth quarter, but these adjustments do get added back into our statutory capital balance. So, total statutory capital at year-end is approximately $20.3 billion. In the fourth quarter, MetLife repurchased 11.6 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $731 million under an accelerated share repurchase agreement. For the full-year 2007, the company repurchased 26.6 million shares of common stock to $1.7 billion. For 2008, year-to-date, MetLife has repurchased approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $450 million, pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase agreement signed in December. Currently, MetLife has roughly $1 billion remaining on its existing share repurchase authorization. In summary, this was a solid quarter and obviously a very strong 2007 for MetLife. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator so that we can take your questions. Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Tamara Kravec with Banc Of America. Please go ahead.
Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities: Thank you, good morning. I have a couple of questions. First for Steve, the hedge fund program that you are moving, can you remind us what size that is and what the average returns have been there over the last couple of years? And in your CMBS, have you seen any stress there? You gave us a rundown of what your book looks like? And then one the $6.7 billion guaranteed exposure. If you could by chance tell us who that is specifically to, and what would the... what would the right credit write-down be given that some of these are going from AAA to AA and the underlying is A? So, have you thought about what that would look like? Those are my questions from Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: Okay. The size of our hedge fund program is $1.9 billion. That program began in the year 2004 and has grown overtime. It's a diversified group of funds over 20... actually 25 funds in total, diversified as style and approach to the marketplace. We seek to get kind of LIBOR plus 400 to 500 times of returns on that portfolio, kind of, inception to date we've gotten those kinds of returns. Obliviously, right now the markets are a lot bumpier than have been the past. So, we'll see how things turn out over the course of this year in terms of returns. And, again, we are making that part of the now $350 million per quarter variable income number, and we put those items into a category of variable income because of the uncertainty of quarter-to-quarter returns, and also because to some degree they are really meant to bounce each other out. So, we have a lot of diversification not only within these asset classes, but among them. We look very closely at things like correlations between these alternative asset classes and that's really helped us overtime. As to CMBS, as I mentioned, we actually had a gain on this portfolio overall as of December 31. Now, since that time, as you may know, the spreads in that marketplace overall have gapped out fairly significantly. So, we'll see where that goes in the coming quarters. But, we do feel very comfortable with those securities we own. They are high-quality securities. We don't rely purely upon the bond rating agencies to make a decision as to whether to buy these securities, we underwrite these securities ourselves. The $6.7 billion of guarantees by the monolines are really earlier across a variety of different securities and also with a variety of different monoline insurers. You can guess which ones they are, I'm not going to lay out specifically in this call how much we have with each one of them. But, there is diversity in terms of our exposure to monoline insurers as to guarantees. Regarding credit write-downs, we do look at that every quarter in terms of both write-downs, losses, and obliviously, if we sell something at a loss that gets reflected in the numbers I've already given you. But, that is taking into account all the comments I've made in my prepared remarks. And, as I mentioned, overall we're still very comfortable with these securities because we underwrite them notwithstanding these guarantees. In other words, we still buy these securities without the guarantees. The guarantees are an enhancement for us. Spreads obliviously have widened because the guarantees now are not viewed as being as solid as previously thought. But, again, those are reflected in our numbers we gave you about unrealized losses and credit write-downs.
Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities: Okay. And then, I guess my questions for Bill would be, you given that the challenge in the loan markets right now. LIBOR is basically collapsed and what the acceleration in the Fed fund… Fed fund's rate being cut. Has your outlook at all changed? You're looking for a steeper yield curve in the second half of '08, but I know you are more predisposed to the spread between the LIBOR and the two-year treasury. So, if also you could just talk about that, that'll be great.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: On Investor Day, I showed this really clever graph that showed the spread between two-year treasuries and one-month LIBOR and I said that's what you should look at to, assume how profitability, sort of, our short-term spreads. And in hindsight, I think, well, experience has proven that that was probably inaccurate, because when we do sec lending, our any sort of short-term lending... or short-term investing, we're not buying to your treasuries, okay. So, even though the treasury yield curve is still sort of inverted because of the two-year solo, even after all the rate cuts, credit spreads have widened and they've sort of compensated for that. So, when we think about our sec lending activity or our investing in the short-term liabilities related to Group Life or retirement and savings, we're already at what I would say kind of a normal shaped yield curve and that's what sort of happened in the fourth quarter. So, our spreads clearly widened and we clearly benefited from the drop in LIBOR and Fed funds. So, we're less tied to the treasury curve than I probably appreciated in December, because the credit spreads have clearly compensated for that, that's good news. In terms of our outlook, we had assumed that short-term rates would come down sort of in the second half of 2008, and of course they have come down a lot in January. I think Fed fund rates have been cut 120 basis points so far, and people think they are more to come. This is clearly going to help our short-term investment spread margins, and that's a nice big thing. Now, we did expect that these spreads would widen over the course of the year and that was built into our plan, but clearly, spreads are going to be wider and that's good thing. That in my mind kind of compensates for this relatively poor equity performance that’s happened so far this year, and in many others ways we really have. So, the short-term interest rate environment and what's happened is clearly a positive for us and has given us a lot of confidence.
Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities: Okay. My last question is just on... in Japan. I know it has only been 2 months since you commented on the Japan Post. But is there any update there, in terms of an outlook on distribution sales or anything?
William J. Toppeta - President, International: Hi, Tamara, Bill Toppeta. No, there's really no update. We continue to work with the colleagues at the Post and to get ready for the commencement of sales. Sales will begin around the middle of the year. But, nothing further that I have to add beyond what I told you on Investor Day.
Tamara Kravec - Banc Of America Securities: Okay. Great. Thank you.
William J. Toppeta - President, International: Okay.
Operator: Over next question is from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Just a follow up on the progress and you said spreads are clearly going to be wider. Is it possible to put the numbers around the earnings impact from what we've seen from the bid? Second on the monolines. Can you provide a little more color on the $1.7 billion, I think it was of the structured finance investment, what's included in that and what are the underlying ratings on that bucket? And then just lastly on the excess variable income. If you can provide us with an update on the outlook for that... the mix, a quarter or two, given the turmoil in the equity markets, you said $350 million of quarterly earnings still achievable in the near term? Thanks.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'll pick the first and the third and I'll let Steve comment on the monoline exposure in a minute. Nigel, can you just repeat your first question a little more clear, I want to make sure I heard it correctly and it was the little clipped?
Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley: Yes. Sure. You mentioned that spreads are clearly going to be wider given the aggressive Fed easing. Just hoping to get some numbers around what kind of earnings impact we would likely see from that? if it is possible to put kind of like a range around the potential earnings impact?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think it’s a little too early to say, yes. I can't give you a specific number. Remember in a lot of... the kind of size it for you and for everybody on the phone, remember we've said many times and I think I said it in last December, the inverted yield curve costs us about $200 million a year after-tax. So, that means we're going to have $200 million, which is about $0.30… it's not quite $0.30 a share. That means we're going to have, we are going to... this environment is going to swing back a full 30 this year. I don't think so. It will be some... it will be some fraction of that, but probably a healthy fraction. So, it's a little bit about how fast it comes back, and how quickly we get the portfolio repositioned, it doesn't... though it seems to have happened in the fourth quarter, the transition doesn't happen all overnight. But, that gives you sort of a feel for the order of magnitude of this phenomenon. You want to do the monoline?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: The monoline guarantees, the $1.7 billion in the structured assets, really cover a lot of different asset categories. A lot of it is in the ABS segment, auto loans, some of that is also subprime, as well as a little bit in credit cards.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And then finally, we are going on with excess variable income. Remember now, just to sort of repeat. We had a record variable income quarter, why? Well, private equity returns were good, they weren’t the best we've ever had, they were good. But, really… what really was probably that we had the best sec lending quarter I think we have had in a long time. So, that sort of what drove the bottom line there. In terms of the outlook, on Investor Day, we said, look we don't expect private equity returns to be this good, and in fact in terms of our return assumptions in our base plan we're lowering them from the 2007 plan. Okay, now the question is this… and I think that's probably true. The question is did we lower them enough, and I really have no idea. I do know this however, we do have some insight into... some visibility into the first quarter results in private equity, and I think it's going to be okay and consistent with sort of our plan assumptions. So, now second quarter, I have no idea. The other thing you have to keep in mind is, and this relates the variable income, securities lending is in our variable income calculation and securities lending spread we are going to widen and we're going to make more money there. Will it compensate entirely for any short fall in private equity, I cannot say, but it's going to be a positive thing. I mean, I don’t know, in the middle of February, we are pretty [inaudible] okay, in terms of how we feel right now. And that is about as much insight as I can give you.
Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley: Okay very helpful. Just one follow-up, equity markets down, can you just provide us an update on how sensitive your core earnings are outside of the private equity in the Life to changes in the equity markets?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. The real of thumb is, a 1% change in the S&P 500 is a $0.01 change in our earnings per year.
Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse: Good morning. Bill, I just wanted to follow-up on Nigel's question about equity sensitivity first, the $0.01 impact from a 1% decline, does that contemplate any change in the net investment income yield in the $12.2 billion of equity securities and other LP interests?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We have to think about redefining that category because it's causes a lot of confusion. By the way, one other thing I thought of while you were asking your question, Tom, before I get to that is, in our base plan we assume a 5% return to the equity markets when we figure out our profitability. By the way, we've done that forever… or ever since we've been public and we've assumed 5%. So, we are not too hopeful, in terms of... when we set out our base expectations. With regard to the equity securities and I'll let to Steve go, he will wink at me if I say some something incorrectly. There is a lot of stuff in there. All of our alternatives are in that category, that $12 billion or so bucket. There is very little real common equity in there, there is a little in there. Most of the rest of it is sort to preferred that’s got an income yield. So, that's what going on there a little bit. Anything else you'd add to that?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: By preferred, we are also talking about hybrids, okay, which obviously have an income that are little lower on the capital structure. Sometimes those get classified as preferred or equities and sometimes they get classified as that and all this depends on the terms of their indenture. So, that's a little bit of... that gives you a sense of that. So, almost… I would say virtually none of that category is factored in 1%, $0.01 equation. What I am talking about, when our equity exposure is really fees on the various separate accounts and variable annuities and now that's most of it and then a little bit is related to our pension plan.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse: Okay. So, the variability in that line is… we should isolate separately if that's going to move around at all?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: That's right.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse: Okay. That's fair enough. Can you remind us how big the pool of liabilities that you have or that reset with short-term crediting rates and exactly what those are? I believe some of those are behind the Group Life business in MetLife Bank, but anyway I was just curious on that.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: You can pick it right off our balance sheet that the securities lending activity was just under 45… footings are just under $45 billion at year-end. It is a pretty big number. The Group Life, we put in two buckets, $10 billion of short-term liabilities, which reset practically weekly are in something called the total control account and there is another, what $5 billion or so? $8 billion or $9billion that’s sort of in the other bucket that also is tied to Fed funds rates. So, they reset, so that's another in totaling Group Life about $18 billion, and then retirement and saving, short-term liability are roughly $20 billion. So, that gives you… so $20 billion, $38 billion, $45 billion, that's $83 billion. It’s a lot. The total general account is $335 billion, I think, at the year-end. So, almost a fourth of our entire general account is tied to short-term rates. So, you can se the kind of leverage that a decline in short-term rates has for us, it’s a good thing. So, this is important.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse: Okay. So, bottom line there is $80 billion or so of your liabilities really do benefit from the steep bidding curve almost virtually immediately?
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Virtually immediately… it can take a couple of quarters.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse: Okay.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That being the longest it takes. But, yes, that benefits.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse: The last question I had for Steve. I think some of the private equity concerns that are coming up right now are centered around kind of '06, '07 vintage investments. So, just curious if you could give us any kind of reconciliation in terms of your total portfolio? How much of your commitments [inaudible] have been made '06, '07 versus prior?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: About 31% of our outstandings in the LBO category are '06, '07 vintages. So, that will have some impact obviously depending on how those deals turn out. At the same time, I would say that the good news is the ability to buy things at lower prices today certainly, it’s more attractive in that way. Financings is tough, so we'll see what kind of deals end up getting done here. But, as we said before, this is a category that has some cycles to it. We've had a lot of wind to our back the last few years. We benefited from that. We were mindful, and we’ve called this out for quiet some time that this is not going to last forever, these kinds of 30%, 40% returns would not last forever. So, we have anticipated and we reflected in our guidance a softening in this marketplace and as Bill has mentioned, I think I have mentioned as well, we anticipate that other categories of our alternative investments may do better, and there could be some offsetting here. We are still comfortable overall.
Thomas Gallagher - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ed Spehar with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Edward Spehar - Merrill Lynch: Thank you, good morning everyone. A couple of questions on commercial real estate, and then one on short-term liabilities. First, could you give us a comparable number perhaps to the 60% or less than 60% loan-to-value today, back in say the late '80s, early '90s period? I don't know if you have that. And then, related, could you tell us how to think about or your thoughts on the percentage decline that you could see in commercial real estate that could be absorbed by the AA or AAA type tranches of CMBS, so we can get some sense of sort of how to think about comparable loan-to-value type of approach? And then finally, Bill, on the $83 billion of short-term liabilities, if you just looked at a 100 basis point decline in rates, I think you needed… sort of tax affecting, you get a fairly big number. So, I'm wondering is there some offset when we think about, kind of, spread widening for those businesses? Thanks.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: I will take the first couple Ed. In terms of commercial real estate markets, we mentioned our portfolio is overall below 60% loan-to-value, and the we backed up in the '06, '07 timeframe in terms of how we are lending in terms of our risk levels. So, let me kind of back up a little bit and tell you what we really issue mortgages on. We really have pulled back from a lot of secondary markets, really for several years now. So, virtually everything we have now in portfolio is what I call A markets and A kinds of properties, fully leased out kinds of properties. So, it's really a very low risk, low loan-to-value portfolio overall. And we felt that was prudent to do. In fact, if you remember the last couple of Investor Days, I talked about not being paid to take risk. This is one of the parts of the portfolio where we felt we are not being paid to take risk. We are mindful of… you just brought up the late ‘80s, early ‘90s period where the real estate market got sideways and there were significant losses. I should point out though that this market probably has to be distinguished form that late ‘80s, early ‘90s market place, where people were building buildings with oftentimes little or no equity in the deals, and there was great over supply in the marketplace in that point in time. That is not what we are seeing today. What we are seeing today I think is a decline in market values because cap rates have become so compressed, people start saying to themselves just doesn't make sense, I can’t make a reasonable return, there are other I can make returns than in this asset category, given current market conditions. So, as of now, we feel very comfortable with our overall standing in our own whole loans. As to the CMBS marketplace, again, well over 90% we hold is AAA, AA. There is loss subordination in those structures. We underwrite them ourselves. As I mentioned at year-end, at least, there was a gain in that portfolio in the marketplace, which is traded mark-to-market day-to-day. So, I think that demonstrates even with the spread widening I mentioned since December that the portfolio overall is very, very high quality and we really feel good about what we're holding right now.
Robert C. Henrikson - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: This is Rob. This is one of these things where I think Steve’s answers are right on. I'd like to crawl a little bit, if I might, about our real estate operations. Keep in mind, we have been and continue to be a very complete real estate organization and so that when you're looking at say 60% loan-to-value ratios, people like to focus on the 60%, we kind of focus on 60% of what. So, in other words, when we value the properties to which we are lending and the owners and the operators and so forth and so on we value that property in the same way we would as if we were buying it as an equity investment ourself. So, I think, this is an area in terms of those high quality properties, in terms of their locations, the diversification, the operators of them, the quality of the location themselves, and so forth, I think it might be helpful to view that in the context of MetLife as a real estate investor in a broader way and as you know our track record on the equity side would certainly indicate that we are pretty good at estimating real estate values in such a way that we take into account recessionary pressures, real estate changes in the marketplace, and so forth that have much greater effect on the secondary markets than they do our portfolio. Right now, where the competition for this lending tends to be… for example, banks at this area of the business, we actually have more opportunity now to do deals at that 60% loan-to-value ratio. So, it's a very, very nice position to be in. Just thought I'd add that thought.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Your last question about math on spread widening, you said $83 billion. If the short-term rates go down a 100 bips, that's a lot of money that seems like a lot more money than what you've been discussing, just to do the math there everybody, hopefully, I can do this in my head. The $83 billion, 100 bips, that’s $830 million pretax. Okay, I talked about $200 million after-tax adjustment that's about $300 million pretax, so what's the difference between $800 million and $300 million? You have to remember that in our short-term portfolios, we're not... what are the assets that back those short-terms liabilities that float. Well, there are short-term assets that float, that's what a lot of it is. So, even though our crediting rates will also come down, so will a lot of the assets, in terms of their yield, they will also come down, okay, that's asset liability matching, that's what insurance companies do. The reason why we'll get spread widening is because we do run in these short-term liabilities, we do run a mismatch. We talked about the softening for a long, long time, where sometimes we'll increase duration and we'll use fix rates and the mismatch isn't dramatic, it maybe one year or one and half year sort of mismatch, when you get a good steep yield curve. But, that sort where that spread widening comes in and so it's only a part of the 830... the liabilities are $83 billion, but obviously the mismatch part of the asset portfolio is smaller than that. So, yes, there is a big offset to sort of just 100 bips times $83 billion. Again, so, the order of magnitude, $300 million pretax that's for a full year and a full steep curve, that's not a bad number.
Edward Spehar - Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: Hi, good morning. Just two questions. First, can you just walk through your methodology for other than temporary impairments? Just wondering if you go by the rule of thumb, $0.80 on the dollar for six months or longer is there another level of subjectivity in there where you may or may not take the write-down or is it pretty formulated? And then second in terms of the buybacks, you mentioned the accelerated share repurchase program in the first month of the year. Any thoughts in terms of executing another one in the near-term and is there an issue around having to wait for that other program to expire before you do another one? Thanks.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: I will take the impairment question first. The first thing we look at his whether we are receiving all contractual payments and whether we plan to hold the security to maturity, and then we do use rules of thumb related to six months and 80%, but they are just rules of thumb. So, we have laid out for you in the QFS movements in those numbers for the six-month category, which you can see. Obviously, with spread winding in certain asset classes and fairly dramatic in the marketplace, that number has gone up. We will continue to monitor that, we will see what the market brings to us in terms of spreads up or down from here on. But, that's the standard we use as I just laid out.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Suneet, in terms of the buyback activity, this is worth talking about just a minute. In December, before we went into blackout, we executed an ASR and the terms of it were... we paid the investment bank the money and they started buying back stock in early January and they bought back 7.7 million shares, that program is done, okay. They have already executed it. But, we are still in blackout obviously and will be in blackout until we file our K and then we can consider our options for buying back more stock and whether will do another ASR or not. ASRs don’t not necessarily mean you get stuff cheaper, but it just helps you especially... it helps you sometimes in terms of flexibility in terms of during buybacks in more challenging periods. We have put out a goal or an objective on Investor Day of day buying back $2.2 billion worth of stock this year. Remember, that was in two buckets, that was $750 million of sort of a general buyback and a $1.45 billion buyback related to effectively defuse [ph] the converts. I don't think by the way that... because the stock price has comedown, I don’t think the cost of defusing the converts is $1.45 billion anymore, it’s a little less than that. With the stock we're it is now, without commenting on the stock price, I think we'll be aggressive buyers, in the near term We have a lot of stock to buyback this year and I see no reason to hesitate in terms of moving forward. But, we got to get out of our blackout first.
Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next we’ll go the line of Eric Berg with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.
Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers: Thanks very much and good morning to everyone. Few questions. With respect to variable income, you normally have changed your pre quarter forecast or full-year forecast. Does this reflect only the inclusion now of hedge funds or have you really upped your forecast? If you sort of see what I mean.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: Eric, it's Steve. We've simply layered in the hedge fund component of our returns.
Robert C. Henrikson - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: So, it's just a matter of… we've redefined it a little of bit. We haven't really changed the underlying investment return forecast. It is worth to spend just a second on this. We have this concept of variable income for a while now. We didn't include hedge funds when we first defined variable income because we had very well hedge fund investments. And since that time, the category has grown and if... certainly, in the past year, 2007, we have had some quarters where... we had one quarter where it really outperformed and two quarters where it under-performed and we realized… I don’t think it was any shock to us, but it’s material enough now that it has... it should… the variability in the performance is starting to matter. So, we said, this is just like any of these other alternative asset classes, it really should be redefined and put it variable income. It makes sense to do it that way. So, we're just saying in... our plan, we assume will hit about roughly $45 million or so from hedge fund returns and we are going to just redefine variable income. So, there is really no chance in our bottom line forecast because of that. I hope that was clear.
Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers: Very clear. I guess my follow-up question. The only thing that has changed here since we last left you is that it seem… this is my impression is that you’ve become much more optimistic than you had been about the outlook for securities lending income, a big and important earner for MetLife. If your views on private equity haven't really changed, you’ve ratcheted down your expectations from 2007. But, it doesn't sound like you're any more optimistic or pessimistic than you were in December. Your views basically haven't changed I think. On the other hand, you are much more optimistic about securities lending. I was thinking you'd be raising your outlook for variable income? That’s why you said I should be a lawyer, maybe I should be.
William J. Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Exactly. You are in the wrong profession, Eric. I think what you say is true. But, I guess, I would…. because I don't know… we obviously assume the private equity returns are going to come down in 2008. We just don't know exactly how much. There is no really clever refined way to assume what private equity returns are going to be. We know they were going to come down. We revised our plan accordingly versus our '07 performances or even our ‘07 plan. Did we bring them down enough, I just don't know. Again, we have some insight that the first quarter is going to be okay. But, the rest of the year is just a great unknown. So, in my mind, I'm not ready as to kind of revise '08 guidance because, I mean, it's just too early. But, I think you sort of captured the spirit of our thinking pretty well.
Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers: Okay. I understand that. Helpful answer. Last question relates to use yields in your portfolio. I think you said today that because of the widening of credit spreads, even though there has been a decline in interest rates, yields are going up. Is that the right take away, because we looked last night at what has happened on BB tranche is over time… not tranches, BB bonds, BBB bonds, A and so forth. And it looks to us like the decline in interest rates, the sift down in the yield curve has in most instances overwhelmed by a wide margin the widening of credit spread. Meaning, it looks to us like, in general, investment yields, our new investments, have come down not gone up. Maybe this question is best directed to Steve. What are you investing your new money at today and how does it compare, given these cost currents to what the rates were just a few months ago?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: It is moving a lot, Eric, and depends upon the asset class as well. So, overall rates have come down more than probably spreads in certain categories, but then other categories, for example, commercial mortgages, as Rob saying, the banks have basically stopped lending, some CMBS kinds of structures have really slow down because that market is kind of ceased up. So, we're now issuing commercial mortgages at 55% kind of loan-to-value situations with very low risk at very, very wide spreads, and we're taking advantage of that in the marketplace that more than offsets the interest rate declined. So, really is asset category by asset category. And also I had mentioned that, we really were in a defensive posture in 2007. Again, we had signaled back to you in our Investor Days in our comments then, but not being paid for risk. And now we're able to go into things thanks to our high quality, A and above, but the spreads have really widened out because of dislocations in the capital markets. So, I’d say overall our new money yields are about flat, maybe down slightly, but very, very slightly.
Eric Berg - Lehman Brothers: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our final question will be from the line Tom Shinoki [ph] with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you. I’d really try to make two quick questions here. One, Steve, if I just follow up, just a little bit more clarification on the commercial real estate, of this approximate $36 billion, how much of that would be in the '06 and '07 vintages. Can you distinguish between loan-to-values in those years versus kind of the average for the whole portfolio and what kind of the min and max is? And I have got a second question. Do you understand that?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: I'm trying to find the data to give you a specific answer. You're referring to the whole loans?
Unidentified Analyst: I guess say the $35.5 billion is what we've been focusing on it in terms of the commercial real estate loans.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: Yes, the commercial real estate loans that we generate ourself is $36 billion, roughly.
Unidentified Analyst: Right. I was just wondering in the '06, '07 then it's roughly… how much would be in those years?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: There is about $20 billion in '06 and '07, which is why you saw that number go down in terms of loan-to-value because, as I mentioned, we became very conservative. We got to a point where we said we are not being paid to take risk. So, we got into big markets, major buildings, loan-to-value and so on.
Unidentified Analyst: So, your loan-to-value actually went down. I just wanted to clarify, I thought that’s what I heard.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: It went down because, as you may remember, a lot of refinancings got done that period. So, so of our mortgages from the past got refinanced away from us in some cases because we didn't want to play and risk your things. And we can find CMBS structures at very tight spreads and they were refinancing away from us, but the loans we put in the books were again very conservative.
Unidentified Analyst: Right, Okay. And then I just wanted to just clarify one other thing. I know we have been over this a couple of times. It’s the whole interest rate sensitivity because in your Investor Day, you had a chart in there where you ran a variety of interest rates scenarios with Federal Reserve cuts rates aggressive and you seem to imply that’s worth about $115 million. Should we assume that what the Fed has done thus far is not aggressive or it is aggressive, and does the $115 million still hold?
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: I am try to remember exactly those models how far down we took Fe funds and the discount rate and all the rest. But, it was some pretty aggressive declines. I am sorry I don't have that data with me right now, but I will...
Unidentified Analyst: Would you characterize what the Fed [inaudible] it seems to be what the Fed has done is pretty aggressive.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: It is pretty aggressive and we anticipate more as well.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Steven A. Kandarian - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer: The numbers you saw in Investor Day, I don't think will change very much at all.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, terrific. Thank you.
